  <title>Dreamseller - Brandon Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Skate, drugs, and rock n roll! --Kat Von D, &lt;i&gt;LA Ink&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skateboarding used to be my life. When I was fourteen years old, I was discovered by Bucky Lasek and Tony Hawk and was on my way to turning pro. I toured the country, signed autographs, and had my photo in skate magazines. Then I got hooked on heroin and threw it all away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon I was living in an abandoned garage and begging for spare change. Ripping off my family and friends meant nothing to me. I was a dreamseller, pushing the fantasy that I was a recovering addict. Anything to get my precious next fix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story of struggling to survive on the streets and battling with addiction in rehab. It&#39;s a story of trust I betrayed and trust I had to earn back. It&#39;s also the story of my friendship with MTV and &lt;i&gt;Jackass&lt;/i&gt; star Bam Margera. I would have died a junkie&#39;s death if not for him. Bam convinced me to write about how my addiction destroyed my career--and nearly my life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Entertaining, shocking, crazy, unimaginable.&quot; --Bam Margera&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;  With 24 pages of photos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;b&gt;Brandon Novak&lt;/b&gt; is an actor, TV personality, radio show host (on &lt;i&gt;Radio Bam,&lt;/i&gt; Sirius Faction 28), author, and former pro skateboarder.  He currently resides in Baltimore.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joseph Frantz&lt;/b&gt; is a film producer, cinematographer, and media personality. He lives in Philadelphia." />
