  <title>Silo - Sheila Chilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack had about thirty-five miles to go on this snowy back road to a farm in Northern New Hampshire. This had been the first silo chosen and converted to a holding house for weapons. Jack and his father-in-law, Frank, had traveled together for the first inspection trip of the site. It had also been a meet-and-greet of the security-checked family chosen to protect the project. The owner and his three sons would be waiting by their modified silo to unload the third delivery of weapons. 
Americas Homeland Security had been looking for a way to arm large groups of citizens if war happened. And this was the plan that Jack, Frank, and twenty other military leaders had come up with after many meetings at the Pentagon. US citizens needed to be armed better than the enemies that our present government had chosen to support. 
Jacks Ford Dually was a pulling champ. The twenty-foot horse trailer was loaded with AR-15s and crates of ammunition. The farmer was retired military, and all three sons had served in the army. They had accepted this secret job of helping protect their community. They would be in charge of distributing these weapons to farm families and to nearby small towns if war happened. The family had also opened a shooting-and-training range on their land. Lots of people had never shot a handgun or long gun before. Teaching the everyday John or Jane how to use all types of guns and use them safely had rounded out this protection project. 
This silo was also equipped with satellite communication, a computerized office, and a living area at the top of this sixty-foot metal structure. The family would take turns staying with their cargo. 
Jacks thoughts floated to his memories of his late father-in-law. Frank and his sweet wife had been murdered at their home in Florida just a few months ago. The murder was still under investigation by local and federal agencies. It had been doubly hard on Tess and the kids. Frank and Betty had always been a major part of their family. With their death, life had really done a flip. Then Jack and Tesss divorce had further torn at the stability of the way life had once been. Jack could not see any other way to divert this evil unknown enemy from his beloved wife and children. He had to stay away from the ones he loved. He hoped it would divert the enemy from showing up at Tesss front door. He didnt know if his decision was right. It had caused lots of pain to him and his family. He just prayed they would stay safe. Then at some point, he would mend the heartbreak his devotion to his country had caused." />
