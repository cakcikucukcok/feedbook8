  <title>The Case of the Phantom Bullet - Jeffery Sealing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Juan Rivera is a young Hispanic male who is arrested, accused of shooting two people to death on New Years Eve in the small town of Ironton, Colorado. The evidence is damaging to Juan Rivera. As he sits in a jail cell inside of the Ironton Town Marshals office, he waits to see what his fate will be. The town of Ironton has only one criminal defense attorney, Daniel Marcos. Although his specialty in law school at Denver University was Constitutional Law, the Bar Association certified him for criminal law. With the help of his secretary Lynn Lyons along with a very capable and beautiful Asian female private investigator named Jessica Kim, they try to unravel the events of that night in an effort to expose the real killer. With very little to go on, Daniel, Lynn and Jessica do their best. Daniel is soon in court with one of the toughest judges in the town of Ironton; Judge Larry Bishop and one of the toughest District Attorneys that the 6th Judicial District has to offer; Linda Bacara. Her tough approach to the case leaves little doubt as to the fate of Juan Rivera; life in prison without parole for two counts of murder in the first degree. Can Daniel get the job done in time? Find out in this, Daniels first case." />
