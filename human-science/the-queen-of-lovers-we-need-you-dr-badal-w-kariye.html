  <title>The Queen of Lovers &quot;We Need You.&quot; - Dr. Badal W. Kariye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Preface
I would like to tell you that the Queen of Lovers We need you, is a fictional romantic novel based on multichannel travels for love and espionage in our world where people practice various lifestyles in love &amp; work. 
This magnificent espionage began in the United States of America where I was encountered to fall in love with the Queen of lovers who changed my lifestyle into the unknown of the dangerous world of counter espionage and betrayals among the leading intelligence communities.
It wasn&#39;t easy job to fall in love with a spymaster who&#39;s been carrying out covert operations around the world, and it was very difficult challenge for me to master her underground strategic intelligence and reconnaissance while I was still interesting in love with the Queen of lovers. 
We&#39;d arranged many ins and outs for our love affairs in emotional romance but we&#39;re very suspicious to divulge our normal jobs to each other until I suspected her that she was deliberately working for the government in counter espionage operations locally, regionally and globally.
I didn&#39;t really like to meet with spymaster to be as my Queen of lovers in the world but everything has been predestined, and we couldn&#39;t decide who to fall in love? However; our Lord is The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful who made possible for us to interact and fall in love with each other.
Romance &amp; Lovers are extremely interconnected friendly in this world where people chose their different ways of love involvement or love discourage in envy anyhow; few people succeeded to keep their promises until one of them retires from sexual curiosity or dies.
It&#39;s very rare to meet your spouse as the government spymaster, and if you didn&#39;t know before then you&#39;re highly at risk to be assassinated before you fizzle out her top level security clearance in some countries. 
My Queen of lovers and I went to visit different continents such as Asia, Australia, Africa, The Caribbean, South America &amp; Parts of North America. Weve met a lot of multicultural and multiracial nationalities who committed to live and work for better democracy in love than their governments, which my Queen of lovers has been spying on.
I couldn&#39;t handle the devilish stress of espionage in top secrets from the governments, which have been opposite to the national and security interests of our beloved country within the nations of many nationalities.
Love in destiny or without destiny, well taste it carefully and legally but when you fall in love with spymaster then you&#39;ll always meet undetectable situations and anonymous hunters who can be anything with credentials from the government to cover up dirty jobs. 
Don&#39;t be a victim of spymaster! You better always ask before you make any relationship with somebody! I love my Queen of lovers finally, and you taught me a lot in governmental secrecy, and how a spymaster acts as a romantic lover to use my linguistic abilities during secretive missions in various continents. I love you my Queen!" />
