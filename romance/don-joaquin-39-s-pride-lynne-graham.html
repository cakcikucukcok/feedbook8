        &lt;p&gt;Joaquin Del Castillo is as proud as his Latino heritage, and he instantly acts to right the wrong done to his elderly, loyal employee. He plans to lure Lucy Paez – the viper that owes money to his employee – to Guatemala, and here she will stay until she repays her debt!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But something about Joaquin&#39;s captive doesn’t quite add up. On the surface, Lucy appears to be a glamorous gold digger, but underneath she is deliciously innocent and soon his contempt for her is rivalled only by his blazing desire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Joaquin&#39;s pride has unleashed consequences he never expected; marriage to secure his legacy!&lt;/p&gt;

Hmm. In a plot which centers around revenge, this story has the h pretending to be her twin to save her selfish sibling, while the H thinks of her as his dead best friend's manipulative widow.<br /><b><i>Don Joaquin's Pride by Lynne Graham - Goodreads</i></b> | Lucy is the doormat of all doormats - not one shred of self-respect or pride. she is a besotted, pushed around twat right to the last page. I have given Lynne Graham 5 and 4 star reviews but this one of her truly awful, awful stories. Ugly on the first read, gross on the second.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Don Joaquin&#39;s Pride - Lynne Graham</a> </h3></p><hr/>
