  <title>No More Secrets - Denise Lang-Grant Lpc, Irene Colucci-Lebbad Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sexual assault and abuse have been called a worldwide epidemic by the World Health Organization, but many clinicians are reluctant to tackle this topic due to their own lack of knowledge or personal anxieties. In this ground-breaking workbook replete with dramatic examples, Denise Lang-Grant, licensed trauma therapist and award-winning author, and Irene Colucci-Lebbad, a licensed clinical social worker with an extensive background in sexual and domestic violence, combine fifteen years of experience in running groups for survivors of sexual violence to present the how-tos of running a group for adults, intended to move group members from crisis to stabilization to integration. Keeping in mind that both experienced and novice group leaders will find this guide useful, they have included evidence-based techniques that will fit easily into any theoretical orientation and practice. This guide is a must-have for any clinician, university, rape crisis center, or legal entity dealing with sexual violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;No More Secrets&lt;/i&gt; is a step-by-step professional guide, which can assist mental health practitioners to offer hope and healing for those who have been victims of sexual abuse. The authors write about sexual abuse with faith in the power of individuals to overcome their experiences and become strengthened in the process. The chapters are written in a clear, concise, well-organized manner and can easily be incorporated into a practitioners skill set or theoretical orientation. This is an important and necessary guide that deserves a wide readership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Luba Shagawat, Distinguished Fellow of the National Academies of Practice and former President of the NJ Society of Social Workers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Being a child sexual abuse survivor and a former Penn State football athlete who loves the school and the program, I spent years trying to cope with my abuse through drugs and alcohol. I was fortunate enough to finally find this group program, and I reaped the benefits. I believe that the program offered in &lt;i&gt;No More Secrets&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderful resource and should be utilized by therapists, university training programs, and law enforcement agencies to sensitize them to the challenges faced by all survivors of sexual violence. &lt;/p&gt;
