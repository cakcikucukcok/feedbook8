  <title>Save Him - Rex Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A professor in a dental college happens to catch one of his students smoking ganja on the dental college roof top. As per rule he has to be reported and proper punishments have to be given. But the professor decides otherwise. The professor (Dr Mathew) was an addict himself while studying for his undergraduate course. He was saved by a monk like figure. Dr Mathew knows from his experience that punishments are not sufficient to correct the student from a developed bad habit. So he narrates his story that is, how he became an addict and how he had suffered and later how he was saved, to the student, in hope of saving him.
Drug abuse is a much rampant disease that is spreading in our campuses. Some of the experiences in my professional life have inspired me to write this fiction. If anyone, at least one person abstains from the usage of drugs or any addiction, after reading this book  the purpose of the book is achieved." />
