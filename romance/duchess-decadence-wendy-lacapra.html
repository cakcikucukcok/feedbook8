  <title>Duchess Decadence - Wendy LaCapra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A game of chance with love on the line...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;London, 1784&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thea Worthington, Duchess of Wynchester divides her time between social engagements and playing her luck against fickle fortune. Yet every gamble is only a bluff-a means to hide from the pain deep within her, and the loss of a babe she never held in her arms. Now Thea&#39;s luck is about to run out. Her estranged husband has returned and seeks a reunion...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Plagued with guilt over what happened to his wife three years ago, the Duke of Wynchester has kept his distance. The duke is resolved to piece his family back together, especially now that he&#39;s discovered his beloved brother-long thought dead-still lives. But Thea&#39;s lovely, porcelain facade is on the verge of cracking...spurred on by the duke&#39;s brother&#39;s secretive, malevolent animosity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With everything riding on her future, Thea plays a daring game of chance for love and her marriage...and this time, the dice are most certainly rigged.&lt;/p&gt;" />
