  <title>Taboo Heat - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Handsome, buffed Marine, Lonny, can&amp;#39;t believe his luck when on furlough, he meets Susan, the girl of his dreams. Under her mother&amp;#39;s spell, they spend a hot weekend in San Francisco. It looks like love, but when Mom is called away unexpectedly and mysteriously, she turns to an old time lover, her dad for comfort, endangering family tranquility and all her hopes for the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It appears that my Mom has played the matchmaker but let me tell you that she is more than just a cupid-like angel shooting arrows. She&amp;rsquo;s always been more like a warrior spearheading a mission. I love her dearly but even as a little girl I felt that there was something strange about her. Did my brother say much about my family and me at your camp?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, Susan,&amp;rdquo; Lonny replied, &amp;ldquo;he spoke often of you and the family. He loves you all dearly, but about your mother&amp;rsquo;s being &amp;lsquo;strange,&amp;rsquo; I did not want to bring it up but since you mentioned something yourself I have felt that she could see into my heart and soul when she looked into my eyes. I even had a trembling feeling rush through my entire body once last week when she touched me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; she responded. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve only know her for a week and already you feel something strange. Well anyway, about me and my brother:&amp;nbsp; we were very close as children, not only brother and sister but also as best friends. He was my guardian angel and if anyone ever tried to hurt me in any way, they would pay for it dearly. I cannot even count all the times he got in fights because someone made an unwanted advance or just a verbal insult. Mom was often called to the principal&amp;rsquo;s office at school for Richard getting into fights and I would always wonder why my brother seemed to get off the hook every time. He was never expelled or even suspended from school when other boys got into so much trouble for lesser things. Then, as I got older I noticed that every time my dad had a serious problem with his business, he would talk it over with her and it seemed like problems would vanish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lonny had a pensive look on his face as he was listening and then said, &amp;ldquo;I think I know where you are going with this conversation and I feel it necessary for my input at this point. As you know, I was adopted at the age of twelve and was one of the older children in the orphanage. I had never been told if my parents were still alive&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;" />
