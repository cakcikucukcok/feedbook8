  <title>Women, Wisdom, and Witness: Engaging contexts in Conversation - Rosemary P. Carbine, Kathleen J. Dolphin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;The New Voices Seminar is a lively, intergenerational, and diverse group of women scholars who take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Christianity. Under the leadership of Kathleen Dolphin, the seminar gathers annually at Saint Mary&amp;#39;s College, Notre Dame, for collegial and collaborative conversation about women in the church and in the world. With &lt;I&gt;Women, Wisdom, and Witness&lt;/I&gt;, readers are invited to join their conversation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This collection of essays by seminar members addresses significant contexts of contemporary women&amp;#39;s experience: suffering and resistance, education, and the crossroads of religion and public life. Theology is brought to bear on some pressing issues in our time: poverty, sexual norms, trauma and slavery, health care, immigration, and the roles of women in academia and in the church. Readers will discover the rich socio-political, interdisciplinary, and dialogical implications of Catholic women&amp;#39;s intellectual and social praxis in contemporary theology and ethics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
