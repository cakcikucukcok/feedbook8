  <title>Gone to Earth - Mary Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;Gone to Earth&amp;rdquo; by Mary Webb is the cry of fox hunters as the fox takes to its den and they lose the chase.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, Mary Webb tells the story of Hazel Woodus whose understanding of her half tame fox cub contrasts with her misunderstanding of humanity. She is pursued by two very different men, a Gentleman Farmer and the local Minister. Mary Webb&amp;rsquo;s writing is sometimes compared to that of Thomas Hardy, her descriptions of nature are vivid and her view of love and life is touched with tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The daughter of a Welsh gypsy and a crazy bee-keeper, Hazel Woodus is happiest living in her forest cottage in the remote Shropshire hills, at one with the winds and seasons, protector and friend of the wild animals she loves. But Hazel&amp;#39;s beauty and innocence prove irresistible to the men in her orbit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both Jack Reddin, the local squire and Edward Marston, the gentle minister, offer her human love. Hazel&amp;#39;s fate unfolds as simply and relentlessly as a Greek tragedy, as a child of nature is drawn into a world of mortal passion in which she must eternally be a stranger." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Gone to Earth - Mary Webb</i></b> | Parallels are drawn between Mary Webb's Gone To Earth [1917] and Thomas Hardy's Tess Of The D'Urbervilles [1891], the two themes of the young, fresh, naïve rustic beauty just becoming aware of her sexuality, causing passionate men to become breathless in her sight, and the love triangle of peasant girl, domineering arrogant squire and the gentle adorer.<br /><b><i>Gone to Earth by Mary Webb - Goodreads</i></b> | Mary Webb's one true tragedy among her novels. GONE TO EARTH is a stunning exemplar of English Romanticism in its wholehearted embrace of the natural world, the primal pagan forces of the human soul, and the incapacity of men of every stripe to understand or accept a woman who is not only flesh &amp; blood, but a living force of Nature.<br /><b><i>Gone to Earth: Webb, Mary: 9781846375897: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Gone to Earth [Webb, Mary] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
