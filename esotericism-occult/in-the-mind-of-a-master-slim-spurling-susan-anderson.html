  <title>In the Mind of a Master - Slim Spurling, Susan Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slim Spurling&lt;/b&gt; was an inventor, researcher, and internationally recognized dowser. He developed the Light-Life (tm)  Ring in 1991, which became the prototype of a cutting edge tensor technology. The science represented in the Light-Life (tm) Technology is both ancient and modern. Quantum physics has shown us that ultimately everything is light and energy. This has been demonstrated with the Light-Life (tm) Tools in the energizing of food and water, cleaning of the environment, and the shift in consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geobiology is the study of the influence of earth energies on all forms of life: man, animal, and plant. Normally silent and invisible, these energy fields are felt by many and affect lives in profound ways. With increasing amounts of distorted earth energies appearing on the local and global scene, people need to be aware of the existence of this phenomenom and learn how to remediate its effects so the pain and suffering associated with it can be reduced. &lt;b&gt;Slim Spurling&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; Light-Life (tm) Tools and Technology offer a means to work with rebalancing our environment in a non-intrusive way without creating an additional burden on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will guide you in the applications of &lt;b&gt;Slim Spurling&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; Tools in developing a deeper connection to life and truth. His Light-Life (tm) Harmonizers are known to raise conscious awareness allowing you to attain greater focus. Comprehensive support for the shift mankind expects in 2012 and beyond is offered. &lt;b&gt;Slim Spurling&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; Tools have been helpful to many people in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing the necessity for chemicals in the home&lt;/p&gt;
