  <title>In-Genie-Us! - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shanaya is a lesbian, but her best friend - the woman she desperately loves - definitely isn&amp;#39;t. Worse yet, she&amp;#39;s about to marry a complete jerk. When a flamboyantly gay genie emerges from her antique necklace, she turns herself into a sexy man. But now can she learn to think like a man, act like a man, and make love like a man...before Allison makes the worst mistake of her life?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shanaya nearly choked. &amp;quot;What? You&amp;#39;re gay? A gay genie?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He scowled at her. &amp;quot;Oh, great. And now I have to deal with a bigot, too?&amp;quot; He waved his fingers mockingly. &amp;quot;Are you scared I&amp;#39;m going to infect you with my horrible gay cooties?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, no, nothing like that!&amp;quot; she protested quickly. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m...I&amp;#39;m a lesbian! So I&amp;#39;m actually kind of glad you&amp;#39;re gay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a lesbian? Awesome!&amp;quot; The genie leaped to his feet and bounded towards her. &amp;quot;Gay high-five, girlfriend!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She lifted a hand and their palms clapped together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now,&amp;quot; he said, leaning against her bookcase. &amp;quot;What can I do for you, o my mistress?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right. Genies grant wishes. But...&amp;quot;First of all, I need to get everything straight.&amp;quot; She chewed her lip. &amp;quot;And I can&amp;#39;t go on calling you...you. Especially if you&amp;#39;re not going to tell me what your real name is. Not that I&amp;#39;m asking you to,&amp;quot; she added hastily. &amp;quot;How about...Gene?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Gene?&amp;quot; He rolled his eyes dramatically. &amp;quot;I suppose I can live with that. Gene. Fine.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And how many wishes do I get? Three?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Three?&amp;quot; Gene scoffed. &amp;quot;Girlfriend, that was centuries ago. You have to keep up with the times. Haven&amp;#39;t you ever heard of inflation? You get lots more than that. But first, I have to lay out the rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded. &amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Rule one: No wishing for more wishes. That is total bullcrap. Also, you don&amp;#39;t get to banish me and then summon me with a fresh set. You start with a finite number, and that&amp;#39;s all you get until you banish me permanently or you die. Got it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gene ticked off a second point on his fingers. &amp;quot;Next rule. No murder, violence, or emotional or psychological torture. We&amp;#39;re kinder, gentler djinn, these days. You want to knock off your older sister so you can marry the sultan&amp;#39;s son instead of her, you better take care of that yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Um...how long have you been away from Earth, anyway?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He ignored her. &amp;quot;Third. I can give advice, if you ask for it. But I&amp;#39;m not going to volunteer information if you&amp;#39;re going to do something spectacularly stupid.&amp;quot; He grinned, sharklike, and she shivered. &amp;quot;Watching humans screw things up is half the fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Any questions?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She swallowed. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s...there&amp;#39;s this girl.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And let me guess. She doesn&amp;#39;t even know you exist, right? You&amp;#39;ve been pining your heart out for her for years, wanting one glance from her smoldering eyes, one kiss from her glistening lips?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No! We&amp;#39;re best friends!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Best friends. Sure. And you want me to change her sexuality so she&amp;#39;ll desire you? Or maybe just a simple love spell?&amp;quot; His look was disgusted, and she hung her head in shame. &amp;quot;Hell and no. We can&amp;#39;t take away free will. No potions, spells, hypnosis, or any of that crap. You want this girl in bed, you better find a better way to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The thought was so audacious it took her breath away. She swallowed, cold sweat breaking out on the back of her neck. &amp;quot;Could you...could you turn me into a man?&amp;quot;" />
