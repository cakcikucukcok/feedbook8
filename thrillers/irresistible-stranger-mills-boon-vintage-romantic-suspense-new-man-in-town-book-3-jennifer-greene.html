  <title>Irresistible Stranger (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Romantic Suspense) (New Man in Town, Book 3) - Jennifer Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Lily Campbell&#39;s parents died in a mysterious fire. Now she&#39;s back for the truth…but nobody in her sleepy hometown wants to talk about that night. And when the fires start up again, it&#39;s clear that &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#39;t want her to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Griff Branchard has perfected his bad-boy persona. But the moment he sees Lily, nothing matters as much as getting close to her. Although rumors about her are flying around town, he just can&#39;t believe such a sweet woman could be a troublemaker…But trouble? She&#39;s deep in it. And he&#39;s going to make sure that the only heat she feels is from the flames of desire.&lt;/p&gt;
