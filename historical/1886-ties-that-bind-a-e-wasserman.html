  <title>1886 Ties That Bind - A.E. Wasserman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1886 as Englishman Lord Langsford travels by train to San Francisco. Newly widowed, Langsford is desperate to escape his grief, demons, and life in England. As Langsford completes the last leg of his transcontinental journey, his life unexpectedly changes once again when he crosses paths with Miss Sally Baxter, a beautiful rancher who packs a pistol in her purse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally has made it her mission to find the men who robbed a train and killed her brother. Unfortunately, no onenot even the owners of the Southern Pacific Railroadseem to care. Unable to resist her pleas, Langsford offers to help Sally and soon becomes entangled in a web of politics, corruption, and greed. As murder, threats, and attacks ensue that endanger both Sally and Langsford, influential men in both California and Washington, D.C. jockey for positions of power. Langsford, who finds himself oddly attracted to Sally, now must sort through criminals and politicians alike to discover the truth behind her brothers death and prevent his own murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is this a fast-paced historical mystery, 1886 Ties That Bind offers commentary on the political and social issues that are still relevant today.&lt;br /&gt;
  Helga Schier, PhD, author and founder of With Pen and Paper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wassermans writing is atmospherically rich. Very strongly recommended. &lt;br /&gt;
