  <title>Designing and Making Rings and Bangles - Miranda Falkner, Evangelos Pourgouris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rings and bangles are timeless jewellery pieces; from simple elegance to bold creations, they make stunning statements.  This beautiful book explains traditional techniques with step-by-step guides, and gives inspiration through stunning examples from leading jewellers.  Written by two award-winning designer makers, it encourages jewellers of all levels of experience to express themselves and make unique pieces of jewellery to be worn and treasured.

There is also a guide to using gemstones with a range of settings.  Written both for beginners wanting to make their first ring or bangle and for the more experienced looking for inspiration, with advice on equipment and materials, step-by-step guides to traditional techniques including simple forming and soldering and an emphasis on the importance of finishing the ring or bangle and achieving perfection. Lavishly illustrated with 200 colour photographs." />
