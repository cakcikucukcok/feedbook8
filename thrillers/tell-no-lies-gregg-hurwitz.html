  <title>Tell No Lies - Gregg Hurwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Another winner from a top-tier thriller writer.&quot;&lt;i&gt; --Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Daniel Brasher left a high-paying job as a money manager to marry his community-organizer wife and do the work he loves, leading group counseling sessions with recently paroled ex-cons. Now he&#39;s about to start a private practice. But just before his last day on the job, Daniel finds an envelope in his department mailbox--one intended for someone else that was placed in his slot by accident. Inside it is an unsigned piece of paper, a note that says only &quot;admit what you&#39;ve done or you will bleed for it.&quot; along with a midnight deadline...which has passed. And the person to whom the envelope was addressed was found brutally murdered... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A fast-paced roller coaster ride...well-written and extremely realistic.&quot;&lt;i&gt; --Criminal Element&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Soon, Daniel finds more warnings in his office mail, to people that the police cannot track down, and to victims that cannot be saved. Daniel&#39;s efforts, however, have alerted the killer to his involvement... and the next threat he receives is his own. Now, Daniel--with no clue what he&#39;s supposed to have done or to what action he must confess--must somehow appease, or outwit, a seemingly unstoppable killer. And time is running out...&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Menace, treachery, and intrigue have never been more exciting.&quot;&lt;i&gt; --&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
