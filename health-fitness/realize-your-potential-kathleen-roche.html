  <title>Realize Your Potential - Kathleen Roche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if I asked you to think about what is on a penny; would you be able to name the three sayings and the direction the President is facing? Why? You see it so often, if not every day? Its such a common item. You probably dont pay much attention to it. You might look at it, but dont really see it. You probably dont attend to the details of it. You just go about your business, putting the coin in your pocket, saving it, using it, stepping on it, but its just a fleeing object in your day-to-day existence. What if this is the same with your success? 
Do you find yourself wanting to achieve success but have started and stopped? Have you wanted to complete a goal but it seemed too large or too much effort? Do you start a project and then get distracted? Are you always putting off your success because of others or time constraints?
Do you think you know the secrets like you thought you knew the penny?
Inside this book are easy, everyday, simple - to - implement secrets along with action steps. You will discover how to overcome any and all obstacles which are presently in your way, including yourself. You will see your time and your daily life in a new way. A new motivation will emerge in which you understand that you can achieve success and realize your potential." />
