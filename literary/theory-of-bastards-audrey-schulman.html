  <title>Theory of Bastards - Audrey Schulman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is finally worth living for Dr. Francine Burk. A recent surgery has finally provided a cure from years of undiagnosed pain. And her subversive scientific discovery, the “Theory of Bastards,” which has unseated public figures and past presidents, has rewarded her with a generous grant and a prestigious placement at The Foundation. Now she is beginning further research on a group of remarkable animals, bonobos—otherwise known as “pygmy chimpanzees.”&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She makes steady progress until an extreme dust storm, sweeping out of the abandoned places, forces most of the scientists retreat to safety. Only a select few stay behind, with Francine and the man she has come to love, to weather the storm and protect their simian research subjects. Through the dusty aftermath, the possibility of a new and better world becomes clear.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not quite sci-fi, not quite dystopian, this superb literary novel defies categorization. Readers will shiver as they keep turning the pages. Audrey Schulman has once again written a spellbinding, original novel that never loses sight of its humanity.&lt;p&gt;" />
