      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Henriks ambitions were different than anyone else in his field, or as a matter of fact, in the world. He could have simply taken the road to success and had an illustrious career as a neurosurgeon with a model wife, four children and a beautiful home in the suburbs, but he wanted more and was driven by a force that could not be explained. A force to conquer the human brain and communicate with it in ways that would change the world as we know it today. His early experiments had already proven that he could retrieve the memories of the dead, but now he had more ambitious goals. He was on a quest to capture the memories of the living and ultimately provide his subjects with new memories, all without harming them. Memories that he had retrieved from previous subjects. Unfortunately, he could have never predicted the casualties that would occur in the wake of his success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
