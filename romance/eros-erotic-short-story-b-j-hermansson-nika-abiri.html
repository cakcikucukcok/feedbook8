  <title>Eros - Erotic Short Story - B. J. Hermansson, Nika Abiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I am Eros. An Adonis embodied in human form. I am a part of the strongest force in this world. I am movement, light and speed. All at once. I am everything you see. I am sex. I make love and I fuck. I kiss and I caress. Hard and soft. Fast and slow. Your age doesn’t matter – as long as you’re of age. You can be young, and you can be old. As long as you’re sane, willing and knowledgeable enough to follow your lust, you’re welcome to my land of abundance.&quot;
He has been raised to go door-to-door and spread the words of his church and their belief in celibacy.
But one day, he has an epiphany and realizes what his true purpose in life is. He will no longer scare people away from lust. On the contrary, he enters a world of sex and desire, and he wants to share it with others.
He will save the people with the force of love and eroticism!
Eros is an erotic short story that shows that there is only one sin – to not follow your own desire. But what happens when people can’t or won’t understand the beautiful sensation we call lust?" />
