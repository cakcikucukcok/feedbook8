  <title>Genesis: The Story of Apollo 8: The First Manned Mission to Another World - Robert Zimmerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was Christmas Eve 1968. And the astronauts of Apollo 8 - Commander Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - were participants in a mission that took them faster (24,000 mph) and farther from the earth (240,000 miles) than any human had ever traveled. Apollo 8 was the mission that broke humanity&amp;#39;s absolute bond to the earth: it was the first manned vehicle to leave the earth&amp;#39;s orbit. Confined within a tiny spaceship, the astronauts were aided in their journey by a computer less powerful than one of today&amp;#39;s handheld calculators. Their mission was not only a triumph of engineering, but also an enduring moment in history. The words these three men spoke from lunar orbit reverberated through American society, changing our culture in ways no one predicted." />
