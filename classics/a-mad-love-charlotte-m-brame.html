  <title>A Mad Love - Charlotte M. Brame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Mad Love is a wonderful tale of against-all-odds romance that will enthrall fans of classic Victorian-era love stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlotte M. Brame (1 November 1836 &amp;ndash; 25 November 1884) was an English novelist. She was born in Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Benjamin and Charlotte Agnes Law, devout Roman Catholics. After attending convent schools in Bristol and Preston and a finishing school in Paris, she worked as a governess before marrying Phillip Edward Brame (1839&amp;ndash;1886), a London-based jeweller, on 7 January 1863. The couple had nine children, of which four lived to adulthood. Since Brame was a poor businessman and a drunkard, Charlotte found herself forced to support the family with her writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her books were very successful with the public, but her earnings were severely diminished by piracy, particularly in the United States. The family lived in London, Manchester, and Brighton before returning to Hinckley, where she died in 1884. She owed money at her death, and her children were taken into guardianship; her husband committed suicide in May 1886. Following Brame&amp;#39;s death, the pen-name &amp;quot;Bertha M Clay&amp;quot; was used by other writers, including her own daughter. Among these were William J. Benners, William Cook, John R. Coryell, Frederick Dacre, Frederick Dey, Charles Garvice, Thomas C. Harbaugh, and Thomas W. Henshaw." />
