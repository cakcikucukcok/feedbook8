  <title>Hell&#39;s Interstate - C.H. Foertmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Hell&#39;s Interstate&lt;/I&gt; is an action-packed crime novel about two desperate men traveling down the highway to Hell. Financing their travels by robbing convenience stores along the Interstate, the one predictable fact about their next robbery will be the fact that they will leave no witnesses. Reed Haskell, the ringleader, knows how to rob a store and do it fast, but what he doesn&#39;t know is that someone is watching his partner, Vernon Sanger, very closely.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Michael Smith, an apparent vagrant they came in contact with one rainy night along the Interstate, keeps showing up wherever they go, and he is not shy about intervening in their business. How he continues to appear, and why he shows up when he does, neither man has an answer to. Although Vernon is curious about the man, for some reason the otherwise unflappable Reed is quite unsettled by him. Does Reed know more about Michael Smith than he&#39;s willing to admit, or does he just suspect the purpose of Michael&#39;s persistent interference?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If Reed was truly in the dark as to Michael&#39;s identity and purpose, he&#39;d not have long to wait before being enlightened. As for Vernon, that enlightenment lies over ten years away." />
