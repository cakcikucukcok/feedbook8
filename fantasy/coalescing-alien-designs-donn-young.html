  <title>Coalescing Alien Designs - Donn Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the ether, early intelligent life forms appeared. They were called the Vitqusoucians, and as they evolved, they became destructive. They selected choice stars at their whim and accelerated the natural aging process, spawning black holes. The materials captured from the black holes were harnessed for the Vitqusoucians selfish needs, without a care for the consequences suffered by other universes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the orbital dimensional explorer known as Orb is out for bloodVitqusoucian bloodwith the guidance of John Dae, genius centenarian entrepreneur. One-hundred-and-thirty million years ago, one of the planets affected by the selfish and maniacal Vitqusoucians was Orbs home world, Folteriata, and it is now time for revenge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe needs to finish off this evil race once and for all. On Orbs way to fulfill its vengeful mission, it comes across a surprise ally with the same vendetta. Together, they must race at a feverish pace in hopes of reaching their goals and stopping the creation of yet another murderous supernova. But Orb, John, and their allies soon find their path is laden with incredible obstacles that make an easy victory impossible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
