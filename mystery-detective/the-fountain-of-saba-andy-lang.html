  <title>The Fountain of Saba - Andy Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;History revealed and sacred discovery. Punishment and redemption in the ancient Kingdom of Saba.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deep in the Ethiopian Highlands lies a secret cavern guarded by a chosen few, for it contains the object of mankind&amp;rsquo;s dreams and deepest desires.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A hoax and fraud.This is how many regard the letter written by the legendary Prester John, ruler of a powerful yet unexplored Christian Kingdom named Ethiopia... but one researcher and historian didn&amp;rsquo;t look at the letter as dupery, Ayana Regassa saw only clues that could answer one of histories greatest questions. Makeda. The Queen of Sheba; the only proof of her actual existence being written in the holy scriptures. A great queen shrouded in legend and myth. Mother to the son of King Solomon... Menelik I, the first Solomonic emperor of Ethiopia!Ayana became convinced that the letter held the key to proof, all that she needed was someone else to believe!Beyond her wildest dreams a benefactor stepped forward in the form of Hans Meisner, a terminally ill and vastly wealthy German industrialist, who commits to funding her exploration. But little does she know that Herr Meisner has his own agenda, and a deep dark secret.Teamed with Dr.James Preston, a British TV star and archaeologist, Ira Goldblum, an ageing and cantankerous Israeli professor of Ancient Languages, Helen Ross, a Wiccan specialist in Ancient Religions and all around odd-ball, plus a squad of South African mercenaries posing as security, they head into the majestic Ethiopian highlands following clues gleaned from Prester John&amp;rsquo;s letter.But the letter isn&amp;rsquo;t a hoax, and the small civilian team soon find themselves protecting sites of great historical and Biblical importance from forces driven by greed, and bent on exploitation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Fountain of Saba&lt;/b&gt;, an African adventure filled with historical fact and discovery, romance, jeopardy and danger, the super-natural,superstition, religious supposition, and for some... redemption." />
