  <title>Manor Town - Kyleen Valleaux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eight months have passed since the Garlon T&amp;rsquo;zen Empire annexed the Earth. For Kiku, their High Princess, it has been a bitter challenge. In order for the Garlon T&amp;rsquo;zen to survive, Earth must be made a safe home for her and her sisters, and all resistance crushed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Exalted Leader of the Garlon T&amp;rsquo;zen, Dessalen has held his power through unyielding ruthlessness. Not until he found Kiku did he learn he was capable of love. But for the survival of his people, he must attend to the Celestial&amp;rsquo;s will and put his desire for Kiku aside. He never expected that not one, but two rivals for her affection would be waiting for the chance to step into his place&amp;mdash;Lysis, one of his most trusted generals, and Devon Blackwood, a young man of Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With enemies known and unknown, an empire in revolt, and their own loyalties split, can Dessalen and Kiku be together?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For mature readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
