  <title>Living Forever - Jan Fawcett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So easily could one imagine this story infused with the rich detail of character, setting, and motivation that would transform it into a memorable work of brilliant insight. Clarion Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this compelling story, Fawcett makes fascinating inquiries about life, evolution and the true nature of man, proving that with all of our technology, the human mind still remains the most powerful and mysterious tool. Kirkus Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with imminent death after a grim cancer diagnosis, sixty-eight-year-old Dr. Ian Farrell decides that he and his wife, Caitlin, should live life fully and appreciate every moment he has left together. After Ian and Caitlin return to Chicago from a spontaneous trip to Santa Fe, Ian has no idea that he will soon have a tempting carrot dangled in front of his nose: the chance to live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ian lands back in the hospital for more tests, two agents from a governmental research agency ask him to submit to an attempted transfer of his mind to an electronic chip. With very little time left to live, Ian accepts. He flies to Project Phoenix the next day with Caitlin and Colonel Wild Bill Clausen, the head of Project Phoenix. After he bids his wife good-bye, Ian swears his allegiance to the United States, lies on a table, and heads into the bowels of a machine that will change his destiny forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this intriguing novel, a dying man now left with nothing but his consciousness must create a new identity and partner with a brilliant neurophysicist in order to save humankind from a destructive technology.&lt;/p&gt;" />
