  <title>Emrys - S. C. Fountain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When eighteen-year-old Bindy Ambrosius--a ward of the state from Ireland--finds herself shipped to Olympia, Washington, as a foreign exchange student for no apparent reason, she is more than a little bit lost. Aloof and with a thick accent, she feels like an outsider, placed with a wealthy family full of druggies and alcoholics. Bindy also secretly possesses magical powers, something that sets her apart from others even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening, she inadvertently encounters Mindy Pendragon, the most popular girl in school, and rescues her from a sticky situation, revealing her power in the process. Bindy and Mindy end up in the hospital, where they meet Drake Galahad, a loner with a secret of his own. The three teens soon become fast friends and unlikely allies on a path that only they can take. Fate will lead them on a journey that connects them to figures of Arthurian legend--and also brings them to the attention of powerful enemies. They each have a role to play, and only time will tell whether they will survive long enough to claim their heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this young adult fantasy novel, three teenagers with legendary blood in their veins discover the truth about themselves and face new threats beyond their imagination.&lt;/p&gt;" />
