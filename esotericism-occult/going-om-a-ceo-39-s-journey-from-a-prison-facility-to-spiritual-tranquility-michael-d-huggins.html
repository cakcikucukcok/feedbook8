      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He always followed the rules, never rocked the boat, and everyone called him &amp;quot;Saint Michael&amp;quot; growing up. He got his MBA from Wharton, became a successful CEO, and then... he went to prison.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a behind-the-scenes look at life in a men&amp;rsquo;s correctional facility,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Going Om&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the story of a man who was least likely to end up behind bars. Huggins shares both alarming and surprisingly funny stories, as well as emails that he had sent from prison, and lessons learned during the dimmest days of his life. Struggling to cope in a world where he did not belong, Huggins turned to the practice of yoga for strength and direction. Before long, &amp;ldquo;Yogi Mike&amp;rdquo; had a following of inmates seeking his help with physical fitness, anger management, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;" />
