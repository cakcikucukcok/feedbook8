  <title>Two Wrongs, One Right - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, former Army sergeant Nathan Schultz let the love of his life disappear without a fight. After watching everyone around him find happiness while his slipped further away, he&#39;s finally ready to fight for Chelsea Callaghan--and he&#39;s not afraid to play dirty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chelsea has always followed her conservative family&#39;s rules--with one heartbreaking exception. When she receives an invitation to an old high school friend&#39;s wedding, she knows who&#39;s to blame. Though she goes solely to give Nathan a piece of her mind, he blackmails her into staying the entire week. With him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s no way she&#39;ll bow to Nathan&#39;s will without making him pay. Unfortunately, revenge is a dish best served fully clothed, and they can&#39;t be in the same room without losing theirs. As insatiable, anger-fueled lust shifts into something more, they begin to lose sight of why they can&#39;t be together. But with so many unforgivable wrongs between them, can Nathan and Chelsea ever make things right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Come Undone series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Wrong Bed, Right Guy&lt;br&gt;* Chasing Mrs. Right&lt;br&gt;* Two Wrongs, One Right&lt;br&gt;* Seducing Mr. Right&lt;/p&gt;" />
