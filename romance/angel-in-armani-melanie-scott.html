With the family business in jeopardy, Sara needs all the clients she can get and the newest one is New York Saints team surgeon, Lucas Angelo. When an unexpected flirtation escalates into a night of pure blind passion, Sara is in agony over what she believes was extremely poor judgment on her part. She wants nothing more than to avoid Lucas. And keep her business her business. But she needs him--in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LEAD TO A FIELD OF DREAMS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a catch: Lucas also needs Sara. Spring training is upon him, and his schedule is madness. So he asks Sara to be his personal pilot. It&#39;s an offer she can&#39;t refuse. She intends to keep him at arm&#39;s length--especially when she discovers just what different lives they have. Little does Sara know that, for Lucas, the only thing more important than business is pleasure. He only plays to win. And he intends to hit it out of the park...&lt;/p&gt;" />
