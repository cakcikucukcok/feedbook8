  <title>Southern Charm - Lieutenant Dempsie Coffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote my first poem while sitting in church one Sunday morning in 1971. Since that time I have been intrigued by poetry and have discover that writing poems has provided me with a way to escape when things start to close in around me. Having been a Arkansas State Trooper for over thirty years I have seen and done just about anything that you can imagine. Some things have been funny, some have been sad, while others have been dangerous. After experiencing a stressful situation I often found myself wanting to forget about some of the events that I encountered and looked for ways to escape from it. I have discovered that a pencil and piece of paper are great tools when used properly and can provide that escape. My love for poetry has grown over the years and I have come to the realization that ones imagination can take you anywhere you want to go. I have written many poems during my lifetime and after selecting a few that I felt like were some of my best I decided to write this book entitled Southern Charm. it contains many wonderful poems that were inspired from personal experiences about the love I have for my family and God.  Reading this book will take you on many wonderful journeys as you travel through its pages. You will experience countless hours of enjoyment as you read it over and over again. If you are looking for something special to share with the person you love. this is it!
I have also written a autobiography
entitled &quot;Life&quot; and a seventy year history book entitled &quot;Arkansas State Troopers&quot; I believe that you will enjoy reading all of these books." />
