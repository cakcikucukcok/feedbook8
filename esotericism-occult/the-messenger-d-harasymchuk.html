  <title>The Messenger - D. Harasymchuk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people in life are given a second chance. Sometimes it is from a doctor sometimes you can&#39;t explain it. I am one of those cases that could not be explained.....until now. I am from a small town in southern B.C. called Armstrong ... I am a miracle. This is a bizarre story to say the least. I have an angel that speaks through me. I have been like this since January 27, 2006. The angel has said: That I was like Christ on the cross  The angel said, also, that  It has taken me five years to understand my own story. This story is a warning for those who do not think God is real. Some will not believe this story. Some of you will realize how a miracle works. I hope some will listen ... I hope. To even believe what I am saying you must know what I have been through. On August 20, 1979 I was in a high speed car crash. Racing at 100 miles an hour I rolled my car end over end eight times. I was hung out of the car and crushed from the waist up. My skull took the hit. I was phoned in DOA.  But a doctor passing by saw the car crash and pulled me from my car and found a pulse. I was rushed to the nearest large hospital in Vernon, but I was in critical condition. Initially the diagnosis was that I had a broken collar bone, and had to wear an eye patch for months. I now have my hospital records which show that my skull was badly fractured, and my brain was bleeding. I lost most of my brain fluid. It was coming out of my ears and nose. Both eardrums burst and my right optic nerve was cut and my right side was paralysed. I was not given much hope.  The local funeral home sent prices to my parents to bury me.  The doctors told my family that if I lived I would be in a wheelchair and a vegetable.  My family and friends - and a town - prayed for me. There was a friend of the family who  worked at the local radio station and I was big news. Every day my condition was on the air waves. Then on the 23rd something happened. All I remembered was a bright, bright red light but I began to recover and get better and better. Seven days later I was about to be released. The doctor who was treating me told me that he did not know how but that it was a miracle. Then I walked out of the hospital." />
