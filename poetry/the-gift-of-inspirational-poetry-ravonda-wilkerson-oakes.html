  <title>The Gift of Inspirational Poetry - RaVonda Wilkerson Oakes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy Christian poetry, The Gift of Inspirational Poetry is sure to touch your heart. The poet, RaVonda Wilkerson Oakes, felt inspired by God to write some beautiful words of poetry; now, for the first time, she has compiled her poems into a collection that she believes the Lord wants her to share with you. These poems may strengthen your faith with inspiration, encouragement, love, hope, and praise.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;Each poem is based on the truths of the gospel, and each one has its own message. The Gift of Inspirational Poetry includes poems on various spiritual topics, occasions, holidays, and many areas that affect your walk with Christ. Many poems offer praise to the Lord and hope through His teaching. A Godly Father and Bless the Child are poems that speak about family and encourage bringing up your children in the Lord. Your Wedding Day and To the Bride are poems that emphasize the sanctity of marriage and true love. Its a New Year, Whos Your Valentine, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are some poems that inspire you to celebrate the holidays. A Soldiers Prayer and Freedoms Heroes reflect upon the bravery of our soldiers who have fought and continue to fight for our freedom. These poems seek to lift you up and inspire you to lift the Lord up in your life. Ms. Oakes chose the title for her poetry because she believes it to be a gift from God. The Gift of Inspirational Poetry can be a gift to you and yours also!&lt;/p&gt;" />
