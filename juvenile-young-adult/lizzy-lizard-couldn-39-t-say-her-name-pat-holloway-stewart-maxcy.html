  <title>Lizzy Lizard Couldn&#39;t Say Her Name - Pat Holloway, Stewart Maxcy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is an educational children&#39;s picture book that has been recorded onto a CD. This book can be used as a teaching tool to help children to say the letter &quot;L&quot; sound correctly. The colorful illustrations are whimsical and they tend to depict the frustrations that a child experiences when they are not understood by other people. Lizzy Lizard attempts to learn from her friends how to say the &quot;L&quot; sound correctly because her friends think that she is Wizzy Wizard instead of Lizzy Lizard. When Lizzy gets angry from the teasing from her friends she goes into the woods and accidentally comes into contact with some tree sap. The sap causes her tongue to stick to the roof of her mouth. She realizes that this is what her friends had been trying to tell her how to say the letter &quot;L&quot; sound. She finally says her name correctly and now she is Lizzy Lizard instead of Wizzy Wizard." />
