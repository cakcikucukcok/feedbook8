  <title>Naked Before God - Dr. Tino W. Smith Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Naked Before God is the compelling true story of a man torn between two roads. To his right is an Apostolic ministry. To his left a more social conscious Gospel like that of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Clayton Powell. Dr. Tino W. Smith knew that God had called him to be a leader before he preached his first soul-stirring sermon at age 14. By age 22 he became the first black male commissioner in Calhoun County Michigan and one of the youngest County Commissioners in the states history. Smiths path toward prominence continued when he was appointed pastor of a church in Western Indiana at age 23. &lt;P&gt;Within five years the charismatic young leader had transformed the fledging congregation into the citys largest African-American church, created the largest financial base in his community and had become one of the citys most influential black leaders. But, turmoil lurked around the corner. After making a stunning confession to his congregation Smith found himself hated and reviled. With his reputation ruined, his finances depleted and his confidence lost, he descended into a deep depression. But, just as his circumstances seemed to worsen Smith recognized he was not alone. Stripping himself of the image he had spent years trying to perfect and leaning on Gods promises Smith begins putting the pieces of his life back together as he becomes Naked Before God.&lt;/P&gt;" />
