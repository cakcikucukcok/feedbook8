      <meta name="description" content="Likewise, because mankind has no idea that extremely advanced godlike entities live on the sun, man does not truly understand nature. Theres no doubt that these entities have, over a couple billion years, engineered the Earths physical environment. We know this environment as nature and specifically clouds. The water from clouds, combined with solar energy, has given rise to life on the Earth through photosynthesis and other processes. The Websters Dictionary describes clouds as A visible expanse of suspended droplets of water or ice particles in the air. Because of the highly advanced entities scientific work on Earth for the last two billion years, clouds are really floating geometric crystalline, highly advanced entities. These ghostly hydrogen gas cities of the skies are directly related to the Sun. Their waste products of crystal snow and water have given rise to life as we know it on Earth. This process has allowed human life to thrive, but roadblocks and firewalls have also been placed on mankinds knowledge. One of these restrictions has been demonstrated when Albert Einstein failed to discover the unified field theory." />
