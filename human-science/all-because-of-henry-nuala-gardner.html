  <title>All Because of Henry - Nuala Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All Because of Henry is the heart-rending story of Nuala Gardner and her remarkable struggle to bring up two autistic children - with the help of Sir Henry, Wee Henry and Thomas, the family&#39;s incredible four-legged friends. In the bestselling A Friend Like Henry, Nuala told how their beautiful golden retriever helped provide a miraculous breakthrough into her son Dale&#39;s severely autistic world. Now, in the much-anticipated sequel, Dale turns 17 and he&#39;s ready for the world - but is the world ready for him? And can their new dog, Thomas, have the same amazing effect on Nuala&#39;s autistic daughter Amy? As she faces up to a new set of challenges, Nuala begins to realise that the struggles of the past are nothing to what&#39;s still to come. And she must also face up to the ordeal of her crumbling marriage and find the strength to carry on against a backdrop of adversity, prejudice, family secrets and some very unexpected twists. All Because of Henry is the extraordinary true story of one woman&#39;s family, of overcoming obstacles, and of the wonderful dogs that helped them through it all. And it&#39;s a story that did not end with Sir Henry - it began - and it continues here, in warmth, heartbreak, hard times and, ultimately, triumph." />
