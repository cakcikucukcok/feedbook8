  <title>Fatal Legacy - Elizabeth Corley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All is not what it seems at the respectable firm Wainwright Enterprises. When the managing director Arthur Wainwright dies in a suspicious accident, his last will and testament throws the business and family into turmoil. Not only was Wainwright far, far richer than anyone had imagined, but, to the horror of the rest of the family, he has left the bulk of his estate to his nephew Alex and Alex&#39;s wife Sally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the beautiful but inscrutable Sally turns her sharp mind to the finances of the family firm, she exposes startling irregularities. But instead of involving the police and bringing more unwanted attention to the Wainwrights, she sets out to uncover the mystery herself. However, when the firm&#39;s financial controller is brutally murdered, the police are finally called in, with Detective Chief Inspector Fenwick heading the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenwick and his team quickly establish that there have been three other suspicious deaths connected to the Wainwrights. Have the deaths happened because the company is a front for illicit activity, or because someone wants a bigger share of Arthur Wainwright&#39;s fortune? As time slips by, it becomes clear that Fenwick is up against a cunning and ruthless criminal, or criminals. But time is running out, and so, too, is everyone&#39;s patience...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with the challenge of balancing detective work with his single-parent commitments, DCI Andrew Fenwick brings new depth and dimension to a gripping police procedural. With its expert plotting and complex characters,&lt;i&gt; Fatal Legacy&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling introduction to this stunning new series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
