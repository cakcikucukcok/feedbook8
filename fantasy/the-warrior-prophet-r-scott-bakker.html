  <title>The Warrior Prophet - R. Scott Bakker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The  first battle against the heathen has been won, but while the Great Names plot  and squabble over the spoils, Kellhus patiently extends his influence, drawing  more followers to his banner. The sorcerer Achamian and his lover, Esmenet,  submit entirely, only to have their faith tested in unimaginable ways. The  warrior Cnaiur falls ever deeper into madness. The skin-spies of the Consult  watch with growing trepidation. And as the vast host of the Holy War endures  its sternest test in the searing wastes of the desert, a name - a title -  begins to be whispered amongst the faithful. But who is the Warrior-Prophet: a  dangerous heretic, who turns brother against brother? Or the only man who can  avert the Second Apocalypse? The Holy War stands on a knife edge. If all is not  to be lost the great powers will have to choose between their most desperate  desires and their most ingrained prejudice. Between hatred and hope. Between  the Warrior-Prophet and the end of the world...&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
