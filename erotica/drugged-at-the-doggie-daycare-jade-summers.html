  <title>Drugged at the Doggie Daycare - Jade Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah gets her first job just after graduating from high school. She&amp;#39;s really excited to be working at a local kennel. When she goes in for her first shift, she&amp;#39;s scheduled to work throughout the night with her boss, a man who says he&amp;#39;s old enough to be her father. He gives her a coke to help her stay awake, but it has the opposite effect on her. Sarah wakes up to find herself naked with her boss and one of the dogs ready to go to fuck her from both ends. Eventually, all five dogs and the owner take turns with her, fucking her in every hole throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we made our way to the back of the room with the cages, I started to feel a little funny. Kind of tired and kind of dizzy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, though. This was my first day at work and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to seem lazy. Simon opened a door and turned on a light and the only thing in the room was a twin bed. &amp;ldquo;This is for when one of us gets a little tired. One of us can take a nap while the other one is minding the dogs.&amp;rdquo; I yawned and put my hand over my mouth. &amp;ldquo;Are you getting sleepy already?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, no! I&amp;rsquo;m fine,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;I just need to finish this coke, I think.&amp;rdquo; I downed the rest of the bottle while Simon watched.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Feel better?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
But the thing was, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel better. I was suddenly so tired that I had to lean against the doorjamb.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Here,&amp;rdquo; he said, taking me by both arms and pushing me backward toward the bed. &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you sit down? You look a little pale.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m okay, really,&amp;rdquo; I said as I sat down. I rubbed my eyes for a minute, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop myself from lying back on the bed. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll just lay here for a sec. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine really soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it, Sarah &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
***&lt;br /&gt;
When I opened my eyes again, I saw Simon standing in front of me. I was still lying across the bed and he was standing in between my spread legs. Everything seemed kind of hazy and confusing. My head felt thick and it was hard to move. &amp;ldquo;Why are my clothes off?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You took them off yourself, Sarah. Don&amp;rsquo;t you remember that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I thought really hard, but didn&amp;rsquo;t remember that at all. But my head didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it was working right. Whenever I tried to remember anything, all my thoughts felt like they got pushed further away. &amp;ldquo;Why did I do that? I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I would have done something like that at my job.&amp;rdquo; I closed my eyes and put my hands over them, rubbing them and trying to get myself to wake up.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You said you wanted to get more comfortable. You told me I should take mine off too.&amp;rdquo; I opened my eyes again and looked down at Simon. He didn&amp;rsquo;t have any clothes on. I could see that he was holding his hard cock in his hand. &amp;ldquo;You told me you wanted to see my cock, Sarah. Don&amp;rsquo;t you remember that either?&amp;rdquo;" />
