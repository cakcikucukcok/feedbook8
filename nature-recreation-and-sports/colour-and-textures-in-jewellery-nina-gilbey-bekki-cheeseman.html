  <title>Colour and Textures in Jewellery - Nina Gilbey, Bekki Cheeseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Decorative textures and colour are integral to the design of every piece of jewellery. This beautiful book covers a range of techniques and materials, which can be used to bring excitement, meaning and interest to your designs. Written by two experienced designer-makers and tutors, it encourages you to experiment, make samples, bend the rules (safely) and see what results are possible, before following the detailed technical advice to apply the techniques to your work. Topics covered include: embossing - techniques include hammering, stamping and roll printing to imprint a pattern, design and details onto the surface of the work; covering heat application and techniques including reticulation, granulation and casting; further ideas and techniques cover the use of removing metal; colour techniques incorporating coloured metals in a piece of jewellery and the use of mixed media i.e. resin, wood, glass, anodised aluminium and gemstones. There are exercises that demonstrate a technique and experiment with the process, including a comprehensive guide to adding textures and colour to jewellery. This book will be an indispensable reference for practising jewellers, designers, jewellery students of all levels and silversmiths. It is beautifully illustrated with over 750 colour photographs. Nina Gilbey and Bekkie Ora Cheesman are two experienced designer-makers and tutors." />
