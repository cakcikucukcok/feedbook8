  <title>Flirting with The Moon - Andrew McDermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LAPD detective, Joe Dean, loses his career, his family and his dignity after the twelfth victim of the serial killer&amp;mdash;The Moon&amp;mdash;is snatched from under his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years later and Joe is a reformed alcoholic working as a private detective in Florida. While following a case, he comes across a book called &lt;em&gt;Flirting with The Moon.&lt;/em&gt; Each of the chapters is a precise description of The Moon murders, sharing details that only the killer could have known. The book is arrogantly dedicated to Joe Dean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publisher is in Sydney Australia. Joe contacts them but the only details they have for the author is a private postal box number in a Far North Queensland town called Candle Stick Bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe becomes obsessed with the possibility of finally bringing The Moon to justice. He flies out to Australia, travelling to the remote tropical North to find a tiny picturesque town overlooking the Coral Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the guise of a US tourist, Joe sets about meeting the colourful Aussie townsfolk. He secretly digs for clues and unearths some surprising secrets about the town and its inhabitants. But as his investigation twists and turns, a disaster cuts off the town from the rest of the world. Then the murders begin once more and Joe is forced to confront the demons of his past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will he discover the true identity of the killer? Or is he flirting with The Moon?&lt;/p&gt;" />
