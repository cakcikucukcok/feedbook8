  <title>The Red Sword of Allah - Gregory Kilgore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;September 11, 2001 was a wake-up call for the United States.  Now, years later, people are getting sick and dying from what seems like any and all processed foods with each victim having differing symptoms.  The food supply has been poisoned by an underground army of terrorists who have been working in the countrys food industry.&lt;p/&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Director of Homeland Security has called in Dr. Bradford Wilson to help head the effort to battle the unknown attackers.  Any food that has been processed or handled in the nations food industry is now becoming a symbolic last meal and Brad must find out the who, what, how and why of the deadly attack.  As Brad leads the investigation, the fight becomes personal and draws him into an anger and hatred where he finds that anyone can become a killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	In time, the country finds the answers and begins to turn the tide, only to discover that this attack was but a precursor to the death stroke of the Red Sword of Allah that is now coming straight at them. They are now faced with saving the entire human race.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The foretold Islamic Apocalypse is now a reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
