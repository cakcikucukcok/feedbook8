  <title>Rebirth - Tyler Golec</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alex is trying to lead a group of his friends from civil wartorn America, but with the world wrapped up in the Third World War, there are not many options for where they can flee. With the hope of escaping their impoverished lives, they try to escape on a boat to Great Britain. As they are making their getaway, they encounter the impossible. Magic has been reborn, and a mysterious man named Zanier leads an army of mages.
What is it about Alexs unique powers that makes him so important to Zanier, and why is he trying to keep Alex separate from his friends as well as Hannah? What will Alex do about Zanier? How can he help his friends, while dealing with his feelings for Hannah, and trying to not become a tool of Zanier? Alex is strong enough to change the world, but it could cost him dearly to do so. Can he even control his own powers without destroying himself and everything he loves? For Alex is the Shadow Caster and all that is darkness bends to his will, or him to it." />
