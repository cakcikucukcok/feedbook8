  <title>Gold Diggers: Striking It Rich in the Klondike - Charlotte Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Between 1896 and 1899, thousands of people lured by gold braved a grueling journey into the remote wilderness of North America. Within two years, Dawson City, in the Canadian Yukon, grew from a mining camp of four hundred to a raucous town of over thirty thousand people. The stampede to the Klondike was the last great gold rush in history.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Scurvy, dysentery, frostbite, and starvation stalked all who dared to be in Dawson. And yet the possibilities attracted people from all walks of life&amp;#151;not only prospectors but also newspapermen, bankers, prostitutes, priests, and lawmen. &lt;I&gt;Gold Diggers&lt;/I&gt; follows six stampeders&amp;#151;Bill Haskell, a farm boy who hungered for striking gold; Father Judge, a Jesuit priest who aimed to save souls and lives; Belinda Mulrooney, a twenty-four-year-old who became the richest businesswoman in town; Flora Shaw, a journalist who transformed the town&amp;#8217;s governance; Sam Steele, the officer who finally established order in the lawless town; and most famously Jack London, who left without gold, but with the stories that would make him a legend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on letters, memoirs, newspaper articles, and stories, Charlotte Gray delivers an enthralling tale of the gold madness that swept through a continent and changed a landscape and its people forever.&lt;/div&gt;" />
