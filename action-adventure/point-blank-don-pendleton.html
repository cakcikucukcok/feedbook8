        &lt;p&gt;Mafia Massacre&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Four deputy U.S. marshals are slaughtered along with the witness they&#39;re guarding, a former Mafia member set to testify in New York. When it&#39;s revealed the kill order came from a powerful Calabria crime family, Mack Bolan decides it&#39;s time to stop the bloodshed at its source.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After arriving in Italy, Bolan learns trouble has already begun. Killing the witness is not enough; the Mafia is intent on murdering his entire family, including women and children. With local law enforcement on the Mafia&#39;s payroll and spies everywhere, infiltrating the family is nearly impossible…especially as Bolan has been marked for death. Dodging bullets at every turn, he&#39;s got to maximize every strike. The Mafia may have home advantage, but the Executioner won&#39;t stop until he blows their house down.&lt;/p&gt;
