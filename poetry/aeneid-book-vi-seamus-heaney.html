  <title>Aeneid Book VI - Seamus Heaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A masterpiece from one of the greatest poets of the century&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a momentous publication, Seamus Heaney&#39;s translation of Book VI of the &lt;i&gt;Aeneid&lt;/i&gt;, Virgil&#39;s epic poem composed sometime between 29 and 19 BC, follows the hero, Aeneas, on his descent into the underworld. In &lt;i&gt;Stepping Stones&lt;/i&gt;, a book of interviews conducted by Dennis O&#39;Driscoll, Heaney acknowledged the significance of the poem to his writing, noting that &quot;there&#39;s one Virgilian journey that has indeed been a constant presence, and that is Aeneas&#39;s venture into the underworld. The motifs in Book VI have been in my head for years--the golden bough, Charon&#39;s barge, the quest to meet the shade of the father.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new translation, Heaney employs the same deft handling of the original combined with the immediacy of language and sophisticated poetic voice as was on show in his translation of &lt;i&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt;, a reimagining which, in the words of James Wood, &quot;created something imperishable and great that is stainless--stainless, because its force as poetry makes it untouchable by the claw of literalism: it lives singly, as an English language poem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
