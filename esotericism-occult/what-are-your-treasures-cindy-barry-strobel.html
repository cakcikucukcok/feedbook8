  <title>What Are Your Treasures? - Cindy Barry Strobel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where moths and vermin do not destroy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and where thieves do not break in and steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Matt. 6:20-21 KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Do you fear death even though you are a believer? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is conquered by the knowledge that you understand the question. Witness how I answered the soul-searching question that Jesus asked me when I was found blue without a heartbeat, at the age of nineteen. This faith-affirming true account of how I walked through heaven is here for your instruction and education. My tale of an angler and his catch on the bank of the river of life may make you realize that even the fish stories are true in the afterlife. The sights and sounds of the great plaza just beyond the Pearly Gates can inspire deep reflection on your expectations based on the accounts you have read before. The first encounter with Jesus reveals aspects of the Lord to modify your vision of the Shepherd as he tends his flock in His own delightful way. The indescribable sights were boundless as I entered through the massive doors to the mansion that He had prepared for me. Hear how I reacted when I saw my name written in the Book of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the grace of God, these connections and recollections were revealed during my struggles as God guided me down lifes untraveled roads. Follow the revelations of my multiple births, rebirths, the beauty of death, and how I found true treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that you dont miss this miraculous story and be the one who is forgotten and left behind! No one likes to carry their own boots and saddle during lifes difficult challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
