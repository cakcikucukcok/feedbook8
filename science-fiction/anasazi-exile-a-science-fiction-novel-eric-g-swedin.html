  <title>Anasazi Exile: A Science Fiction Novel - Eric G. Swedin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Archeology wasn&#39;t supposed to get him killed. For two decades, Harry Deacon had served as a skilled and loyal soldier, and it&#39;d cost him his marriage and many dead friends. His new career of digging for artifacts and esoteric knowledge seems safe enough--until he finds an Anasazi tomb in Chaco Canyon that shouldn&#39;t be there. Only hours after Harry emails news of his discovery to a fellow archeologist at a conference in Scotland, she and her students are murdered--and Harry and his assistant are attacked by two hired killers. Harry must turn to his old skills as his life becomes a frenzied struggle for survival when more assassins close in. Who was buried in the tomb and where did he come from? What was in the strange container housed in the coffin? As Harry begins to solve the mystery of Chaco Canyon, he learns an astonishing secret: the history of our planet is NOT what we&#39;ve been taught! A grand science fiction suspense novel." />
