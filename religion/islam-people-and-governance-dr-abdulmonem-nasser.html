  <title>Islam: People, and Governance - Dr. Abdulmonem Nasser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(Man is)Either a brother to you in faith, or equivalent to you in creation.
Th is phrase best describes how Islam looks at humanity. It is the basic notion in
this work, written by Imam Ali, at the beginning of Islam.
Islam is wrongfully portrayed by the unlawful actions of certain fanatics as a
doctrine of hatred and enmity towards its adversaries, especially since 9/11,
2001. Th is work is an attempt to show the bright and civilized face of Islam,
as a complete way of life, stressing that man has the right to live in dignity and
freedom. Th e two main pillars in Islam as a divine faith revealed to Prophet
Mohammad, are: belief in Allah, and doing good deeds.
Th is work is a study of a treatise written by Ali ben Abi Talib on governance.
Imam Ali, the most faithful disciple of P. Mohammad, his cousin and son in
law, became the fourth Caliph in the state of Islam, 24 years after the death of
the Prophet. During his rule, he wrote this treatise, which covers all aspects of
administration, description of various civil and security establishments designed
to serve the daily needs of people, and qualifi cations of the personnel employed.
Besides that, the document stresses the basic rights of humanity in freedom and
democracy, and encourages the pursuit of knowledge. Ali gave that document
to one of his companions, whom he appointed governor of Egypt, to follow its
detailed instructions in his assignment as a servant of the people." />
