  <title>The Healing Journey of My Bodacious Ta Ta&#39;s - Lisa Smith, Venus DeMarco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Venus DeMarco was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, she did what anyone would do. She saw specialists, got second opinions, and began weighing her options for a path to recovery. But unlike most, her decision did not include surgery, burning, or poison. Rather, it took her on an international journey to self-discovery, where she learned to heal not only her body but also her mind and spirit. 
&lt;p&gt;
The Healing Journey of My Bodacious Ta Tas is DeMarco&#39;s story of natural salvation from one of the most diagnosed diseases today. The memoir takes you along on DeMarco&#39;s life-changing - and at times humorous - adventure, as she looks cancer in the face and defeats it. The story will educate and inspire you to live a fuller and healthier life, and to look for the possibilities found along the road less traveled.&lt;br&gt;" />
