      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She never met a man like him before, a powerful billionaire who &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; gets what he wants.  Now she&#39;s about to enter an exclusive world of glittering opulence and all-consuming passion--where she&#39;ll explore the darkest reaches of her own desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seduced into a job as &quot;personal assistant&quot; to billionaire CEO Jeremiah Hamilton, Lucy Delacourt has all but signed her body over to him, promising to do anything he wants. Now she&#39;s Paris-bound and determined to resist him and the diamond-studded world of the ultra-rich. But Jeremiah isn&#39;t interested in forcing Lucy to obey a simple contract. He knows exactly what he wants: his new assistant&#39;s complete surrender. And Lucy finds, to her horror, that the price she has to pay might be something she secretly craves. &lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other installments of the scorching serial novel Anything He Wants: The Meeting (Part 1), The Secret (Part 3), The Rescue (Part 4) and The Betrayal (Part 5) available now!&lt;/p&gt;" />
