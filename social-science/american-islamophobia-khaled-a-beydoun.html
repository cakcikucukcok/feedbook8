  <title>American Islamophobia - Khaled A. Beydoun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&amp;quot;I remember the four words that repeatedly scrolled across my mind after the first plane crashed into the World Trade Tower in New York City. &amp;lsquo;Please don&amp;rsquo;t be Muslims, please don&amp;rsquo;t be Muslims.&amp;rsquo; The four words I whispered to myself on 9/11 reverberated through the minds of every Muslim American that day, and every day after. &amp;hellip; This fear, followed by the collective breath or brace for the hateful backlash that follows, symbolizes the existential tightrope that defines Muslim American identity today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;The term &amp;ldquo;Islamophobia&amp;rdquo; may be fairly new, first used in the 1970s, but the phenomenon of the irrational fear and hatred of Islam and Muslims is anything but. Though many speak of Islamophobia&amp;rsquo;s roots in racism, have we ever considered how anti-Muslim rhetoric is rooted in our own legal system?&amp;#160;Through his unique lens as a critical race theorist and law professor, Khaled A. Beydoun provides a novel discourse on how law, policy, and official state rhetoric has fueled the frightening resurgence of Islamophobia. Beydoun charts the long and terrible history of Islamophobia in the U.S., from enslaved African Muslims in the Antebellum South, the legal prohibition of extending citizenship to Muslim immigrants, how the War on Terror assigns the immediate presumption of any terrorist act to Islam, and the myriad of trials Muslim Americans face during the Trump Era. Beydoun passionately argues that by failing to frame Islamophobia as a system of bigotry endorsed and emboldened by law and carried out by government actors, U.S. society ignores the injury it inflicts on both Muslims and non-Muslims. Through stories from people who have experienced Islamophobia across various racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines within the Muslim American population, Beydoun shares how U.S. laws directly and inadvertently shatter lives. And with an eye towards improving society as a whole, Beydoun recommends ways for Muslim Americans and their allies to build coalitions with other groups. Like no other book before it, &lt;I&gt;American Islamophobia&lt;/I&gt; seeks to offer a robust and genuine portrait of Muslim America, then and now." />
