  <title>Quest for the Scorpion&#39;s Claws - Keith D. Mc Swain Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For many years, the dark wizard has sacrificed the lives of their children to appease the shadowy powers of the underworld! The people lived in abject terror, but in time, fear changed into desperation! The cry for emancipation could no longer be unanswered!
His mouth frothing like a cur gone mad, his cracked, bleeding lips whispered a thousand curses with each tortured breath. Akrim vowed that Satan will surely avenge his degradation at the hands of his captors! He stated that during the kings third generation, three children will be born at the same time, in the same land, and on the same day!
Notwithstanding, it was through the years, along with the righteous prayers of the people within the village, that the dreaded prophecy was altered. It was preordained that if such dire consequences should manifest themselves, no less than two of the three children shall rise against this invincible adversary to destroy him and restore the bounty of the land!
And that a great source of power shall be wielded by them against the rampaging leviathan from the subterranean bowels of hell! A source of power known solely as the Scorpions Claws." />
