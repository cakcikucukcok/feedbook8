  <title>Unlocking the Cellar Dreams of a Poet - Joe Gonzalez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I hope the poems in this book bring smile, a thought, or an understanding about life in more ways than one. My third book will be a novel and is already in the making and, hopefully, will be out sometime in 2018. The title is complete but will not be revealed until a later time. If you like reading trilogies, I truly hope you enjoy reading this book of poems.
My wife, Orelia (Cookie), is, and will always be, my inspiration. And I know that she will be forever grateful for many of the poems included in this book. I also hope you will enjoy reading this book of poems." />
