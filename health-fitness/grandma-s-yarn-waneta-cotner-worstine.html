  <title>Grandma’S Yarn - Waneta Cotner Worstine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, not so very long ago, in a big old country farmhouse, lived a little old farmer and his wife. They were a friendly pair, and everyone just called them Grandma and Grandpa. Their children lived far away and their grandchildren were growing up, so sometimes the elderly couple became very bored and very lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one day, they started thinking about Christmas and how exciting it would be to have the whole family home again. Grandma wanted to make a very special memory for the entire family, so she created a plan that involved using many different colors of yarn. Just before the holiday, Grandma and Grandpa prepared the surprise, and they could hardly wait for the family to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a true story that took place at the home of Waneta Cotner Worstines parents in 1988, Grandmas Yarn shares the importance of creating strong family relationships and wonderful memories. Through yarn illustrations and words, it celebrates the simple joys of being a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful gift to all! Nita not only shared a beautiful memory, but allowed her readers to go back and recall one of their own treasured memories as well. And with her beautiful story came thoughts of how we all could create such blessings for our families.&lt;/p&gt;
