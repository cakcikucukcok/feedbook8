  <title>Running South - Ritchie Allen Greer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the dead of night, three young slave kids, Isaac, Felicia, and Samuel, are suddenly awoken from their slumber by their parents, Duke and Elizabeth.
Moments later, the confused kids are dragged through the dew-covered cotton fields and into the forest. Felicia then pleads for an explanation but only gets silence from her parents.
The kids are pushed by Duke and Elizabeth further than they&#39;ve ever been before. Then, without warning, they arrive at a valley that has train tracks cutting through the heart of it. As they try to catch their breaths, their Ma and Pa inform them that they are to stow away on a train that will take them North, to freedom.
As the ground beneath them begins to tremble, the mighty train approaches. It is then when they realize that they&#39;ll be taking this journey alone and that these are the final moments they&#39;ll ever spend with their parents.
Tears fill their eyes as the kids make a mad dash to board the last remaining boxcar. Their hearts race, which seems to increase their speed, as they lunge towards and cling on to the train of freedom.
The kids crouch in the corner in the back of the boxcar, their minds reeling from the life-altering event. It isn&#39;t long until they discover that the route has changed. Instead of the train heading North, it turns further South where the Civil War is raging.
Isaac, Felicia, and Samuel are lost and alone and must find a way North through treacherous terrain while being pursued by slave hunters who will stop at nothing to retrieve their prize. Along the way, they stumble upon something that could possibly turn the tides of the War. But the question remains: What sacrifices are they willing to make for not only their freedom but also for the freedom of an entire race?" />
