  <title>Dancing Deeper Still - Martin Keogh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You went to your first Contact Improvisation (C.I.) class, or a friend invited you to the weekly jam, and you&amp;rsquo;re captivated. Or perhaps, you&amp;rsquo;ve been dancing and investigating for years. What&amp;rsquo;s next? What discoveries await you in your dance?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1972, Steve Paxton convened a group of athletes and dancers to research the principles of Contact Improvisation. Since then the form has matured into a worldwide, collaborative experiment with no central control. Everyone who enters adds their findings and permutations to this inherently unfinished dance form.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dancing Deeper Still&lt;/i&gt; is a sourcebook of essays on Contact Improvisation, a philosophical treatise, and a handbook. This compilation of 30 years of writings is meant to accompany and support your investigation as you discover new pathways and dynamics in your dancing. It includes chapters on:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot; Contact Improvisation in performance&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot; Boundaries and sexuality&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot; Political activism&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot; Dancing while aging&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot; Expanded teaching research notes&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot; Advanced skills&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Whether you are the improviser who savors the slow rivers of sensation&amp;hellip;or who delights in spontaneous acrobatics&amp;hellip;or any of the bountiful realms in between, this book was written for you. Your discoveries enrich the community-held body of knowledge in our ever-evolving form. I invite you to dance deeper still.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Martin Keogh&lt;/b&gt; dances, teaches, and researches Contact Improvisation. His love for the dance has taken him to 31 countries across six continents. Keogh was named a Fulbright Senior Specialist for his contribution to the development of the form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Martin spent time in monasteries in Japan and Korea and was the director of the Empty Gate Zen Center in Berkeley, CA before he discovered the world of dance. He is the author of: &lt;i&gt;As Much Time as it Takes&lt;/i&gt; and the anthology: &lt;i&gt;Hope Beneath Our Feet: Restoring Our Place in the Natural World. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
