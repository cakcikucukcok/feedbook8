  <title>The Flawed Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amber&#39;s once lithe body had been crippled and disfigured by a horrible accident. The prospect of never walking again disheartened her, but much worse was the pain she felt when her fiance suddenly abandoned her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Time had done nothing to heal her broken heart. And although she could walk again, resuming her nursing career was out of the question. Then a stranger offered her employment, a home and the money for a necessary operation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All she had to do was become his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
