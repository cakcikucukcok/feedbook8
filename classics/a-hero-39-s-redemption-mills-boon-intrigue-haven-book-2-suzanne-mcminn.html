          &lt;strong&gt;He was living on borrowed time… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Caught in a supernatural time shift, Dane Maguire was transported back to the week of Calla Jones&#39;s death. He&#39;d be falsely convicted of murder again if he couldn&#39;t stop the past from repeating itself. Dane didn&#39;t count on his attraction for Calla.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The owner of a Christmas tree farm, she&#39;d sheltered him from a raging blizzard, but even the cold couldn&#39;t stop the heat between them. Was this a second chance or a cruel joke played by their enemies? Calla and Dane had two days to discover the truth–and each other–or history would repeat itself, and Calla would die.&lt;/p&gt;
