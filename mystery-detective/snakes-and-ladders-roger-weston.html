      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just when he thought the worst was behind him, Cameron Walker is about to learn that life is about to get even more complicated and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the traumatic events of his last fateful assignment, listed in the intelligence files as the Backgammon Syndrome, he&#39;s now confronted with a new game  a deadly game  Snakes and Ladders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this just a game of chance, where the players fate hangs on the roll of the dice, or is it much more insidious? The strategies used are far from apparent, and Walker must now determine how the game is to be played. The search for Zelie de Blanco and her organization of evil continues. In his hunt for Jocastas killers, hes up against enemies so dangerous, Walkers thrown off his own game in the process. His foes are stronger, more secretive, and dangerously more ambitious than hes dealt with before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their goal is nothing less than the destruction of the worlds economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with the stakes higher than ever, Walker must also face the truth. Why did he fail? And is it justice he seeksor simply brutal revenge? Even he must question the legitimacy of the incompetence charges leveled against him. And when he gets to the core of the matter and learns who and what he really is, he must decide to rise above or fall victim to that reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is as it seems in the new thriller from Roger Weston, the sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Backgammon Syndrome&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
