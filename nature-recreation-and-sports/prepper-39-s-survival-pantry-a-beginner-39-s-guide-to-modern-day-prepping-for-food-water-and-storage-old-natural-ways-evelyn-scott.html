  <title>Prepper&#39;s Survival Pantry: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Modern Day Prepping For Food, Water, And Storage - Old Natural Ways, Evelyn Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Knowledge and correct information are the first steps to survival. There are generic preparations that are appropriate for every emergency situation. However, concrete and careful planning is needed for you and your family to survive during emergency situations. For instance, you prepared a basic prep kit that includes a first aid kit, matches, bottled water, and no-cook food items. This kit can be easily packed in your car for emergency cases while on the road. This is a life saver. However, this kit will do only a little help if you are facing complex situations such as freezing water. You do not have enough proper supplies to meet the exacting needs of the situation because you as the prepper did not anticipate the additional gear you will need." />
