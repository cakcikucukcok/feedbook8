  <title>Web of Innocence - Henry Klooster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For eighteen-year-old Will Hulst, life should have been relatively uncomplicated.  Raised in a strictly religious home, he struggled with the usual questions of youth; seemingly unanswerable questions about life and faith. Now he stands accused of a murder he did not commit. Only one person truly believes in his innocence, Barb Prescott a bright young attorney assigned to his defense, she has been assigned a case that on the surface appears indefensible. As Barb begins her defense she uncovers mounting evidence pointing to a cover-up and is drawn deeper and deeper into a web that involves, the local Police Chief out to satisfy a vow of revenge made decades before, a prominent businessman who will do anything to protect his illegitimate empire, and her love for a young Deputy that could destroy her career. Wills only hope for acquittal lies with a former girl friend  (Crystal Simpson) a girl he had shunned and embarrassed, a witness who has mysteriously disappeared. 
The book is filled with a rich tapestry of characters, that struggle with their own emotions and feelings; interwoven with a series of twists and turns, that all lead to a stunning and unexpected conclusion, as they are inexplicably drawn into a tangled  Web Of Innocence" />
