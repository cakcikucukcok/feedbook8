  <title>Responsibility for Justice - Iris Marion Young, Martha Nussbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the noted political philosopher Iris Marion Young died in 2006, her death was mourned as the passing of  &quot;one of the most important political philosophers of the past quarter-century&quot; (Cass Sunstein) and as an important and innovative thinker working at the conjunction of a number of important topics: global justice; democracy and difference; continental political theory; ethics and international affairs; and gender, race and public policy. 
  In  her long-awaited Responsibility for Justice, Young discusses our responsibilities to address &quot;structural&quot; injustices in which we among many are implicated (but for which we not to blame), often by virtue of participating in a market, such as buying goods produced in sweatshops, or participating in booming housing markets that leave many homeless.  Young argues that addressing these structural injustices requires a new model of responsibility, which she calls the &quot;social connection&quot; model. She develops this idea by clarifying the nature of structural injustice; developing the notion of political responsibility for injustice and how it differs from older ideas of blame and guilt; and finally how we can then use this model to describe our responsibilities to others no matter who we are and where we live.
 With a foreward by Martha C. Nussbaum, this last statement by a revered and highly influential thinker will be of great interest to political theorists and philosophers, ethicists, and feminist and political philosophers." />
