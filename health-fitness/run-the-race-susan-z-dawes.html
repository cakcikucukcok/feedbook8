  <title>Run the Race - Susan Z. Dawes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Honest, humorous, and at times heart breaking, &lt;I&gt;Run the Race: A Father&#39;s Legacy of Life Lessons&lt;/I&gt; is the moving true story of how one loving and devoted father inspired his daughter to run not only long distances, but also the real races of life. &lt;p&gt;
During the spring of seventh grade, author Susan Dawes&#39;s father, Floyd Seibert, introduces her to long-distance running at a high school girls&#39; track meet in their hometown of Adel, Iowa. Secure in her father&#39;s confidence in her ability, she begins to run long distances for the Adel Junior High Tigerette track squad the next season. Supported by her father&#39;s sustaining guidance and influence, she is ecstatic to finally find a sport she loves.&lt;p&gt;
When a younger and faster girl joins the team, Susan begins to doubt her talent. She complains to her father and tells him she wants to quit. But Floyd Seibert offers the advice she will come to count on for the rest of her life: &lt;I&gt;there will always be another race to run&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Inspiring and encouraging, &lt;I&gt;Run the Race&lt;/I&gt; shares the deep bond between father and daughter, the strength they build, and the courage they gain in the races of life.&lt;p&gt;" />
