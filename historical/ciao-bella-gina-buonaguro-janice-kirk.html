  <title>Ciao Bella - Gina Buonaguro, Janice Kirk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Graziella, the quiet, cultured life she lived in Venice with her musician husband, Ugo,  was everything she could have hoped for. But when Italy allied itself with Nazi Germany in 1940, her world changed forever. Ugo, trading in his violin for a gun, joined the Resistance, while Graziella was forced to seek refuge at his family&#39;s farm in the nearby Euganean Hills. &quot;Just until the war is over,&quot; Ugo had promised, but it has been months now since the Nazis retreated, and no one has seen him since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ugo gone, it seems as if she will be trapped forever on this remote farm with her lost husband&#39;s difficult family. So when an American soldier named Frank is stranded on the mountain, Graziella embraces this unexpected chance at being happy again. But as tempting as it is to leave behind this war-torn country and her painful memories for a new life in America, can she go without learning her husband&#39;s fate? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With quiet grace and humor, &lt;i&gt;Ciao Bella&lt;/i&gt; explores the possibilities of love and redemption in the wake of war, showing that some of the hardest decisions come only after the fighting has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;" />
