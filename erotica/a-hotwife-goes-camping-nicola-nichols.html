~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Going on a camping trip with Jack and his old college friends, Bill and Eve, wasn&amp;#39;t exactly what Patty wanted to be doing with her weekend. Patty met Jack after school, when he&amp;#39;d come to the city for a new job. She&amp;#39;d never even met them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Bill and Eve had stayed in touch with Jack, and now they&amp;#39;d come to town for a visit. Bill had decided camping would be fun. Patty was sure it wouldn&amp;#39;t. The point of their invitation was for them to spend time catching up on old times. They wanted to compare their lives with their dreams and talk about people they knewpeople Patty had never met.. So, it was easy to be sure that she&amp;#39;d just be tagging along, be polite, and feeling left out of the conversation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;#39;t even like the outdoors all that much. She much preferred her creature comforts, like her comfy bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, she could&amp;#39;ve stayed home and suggested that Jack make the trip with his friends, but... She hadn&amp;#39;t been married long enough to be comfortable sending her husband off into the woods with another woman, even if the woman&amp;#39;s husband was along. It was especially true since she knew Jack and Eve had been lovers in school; he&amp;#39;d made no secret about it. He told her that they&amp;#39;d been lovers for a year or two. Eventually, they grew apart. She turned to their friend Bill and after school, they married. It was all very civilized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another factor was that Patty didn&amp;#39;t want to spend time home alone, especially the nights. She and Jack had an active sex life, which was just how she liked it. He often came home randy and wanting her. The thought of being alone in bed for several nights was almost chilling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she finally met Bill and Eve, she knew she had to go with them. Eve was a stunning woman. Bill was pretty good looking too. They were friendly toward her and made it sound as if her being along was essential to their happiness. So she pretended to be excited, even though she wasn&amp;#39;t sure that Jack wouldn&amp;#39;t have preferred for her to stay home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, that Saturday they all piled into an SUV and drove out into the wilderness. That afternoon, instead of cuddling with Jack in her living room, sipping a glass of wine, she found herself helping set up a tent in the woods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;#39;d picked, she reluctantly admitted, as if she were conceding her high ground, a beautiful campsite as campsites went. The air was fresh and clean. She couldn&amp;#39;t complain really, not about the spot. As she expected, the three rattled on, carrying on animated conversations about people, places and times that meant nothing to her at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;#39;d pitched a small tent for each couple. Then Eve and Bill wanted to hike up the hill to see the view. Especially Eve. &amp;quot;The overlook here is supposed to be fabulous.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too wiped out to go for a hike,&amp;quot; Patty protested. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not great at hiking under the best of circumstances. My idea of camping is to sit by the fire and relax, maybe listen to the wind in the trees.&amp;quot; And, if you had to be out in the woods, having sex under the open sky sounded nice. Unfortunately, managing the privacy to do that was going to be hard under the circumstances." />
