  <title>connections - Pam Osbourne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Connections is a book for people whose lives have been touched by Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease and Other Dementias (ADRD). A guide for health care professionals, Animal Assisted Therapy teams, family members, friends or caregivers, the book is insightful, informative and instructive in its ability to show how Animal Assisted Therapy can be used to help those with ADRD connect some dots that might otherwise remain unconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a first-hand personal account of the author&amp;rsquo;s own experiences with her mother who was affected by ADRD the last six years of her life, and her father who did everything in his power to take care of his wife of over 70 years. Her therapy dog, Rufus played a major role by providing her parents gentle companionship at times and at other times interacting with them in a way that encouraged more activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by what Rufus and her mom accomplished together, after her mom&amp;rsquo;s death the author and Rufus continued to visit the other residents at her mom&amp;rsquo;s community. This book shows how some very ordinary activities can make a difference in a life in an extraordinary way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, funny, sometimes heartbreaking. But for anyone who wants to improve the quality of lives of those with ADRD, this is a must read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
