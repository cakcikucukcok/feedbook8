  <title>The Quest - Sylvie Ginestet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victim of an incurable catastrophe of health, Lilly nurtures the foolish hope to overcome her ordeal by being transformed into a vampire. Soon, a protracted quest begins. A path beset with pitfalls and disappointments; since vampires are not myriad... And rare are those who would take the risk of helping a human being. Never-theless...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My perception of things had now changed, my plan was com-pletely crazy and dangerous. Why hadn&amp;#39;t I felt it before? I&amp;#39;d lived through the most terrible night of my existence. I&amp;#39;d never been so frightened. But this new development: I&amp;#39;d provoked it myself and I now knew I could never physically go through it again. I was ex-hausted, emptied. And yet, he&amp;#39;d hardly touched me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My life was too important to put at risk. I was just a fool in search of a better life, but I&amp;#39;d have to be content with what I had. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Lilly going to give up her project, or will her desire to live another existence be stronger?" />
