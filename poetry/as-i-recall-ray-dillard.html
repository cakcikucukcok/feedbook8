  <title>As I Recall - Ray Dillard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;As I Recall&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of humorous and heartfelt short stories and poetry sharing
moments from a life full of laughter and love. Author Ray Dillard has long wanted to record these memories of his life for family and friends; however, early in the process, he discovered more than the need to create a personal legacy for his family. He found a new voice that told colorful and descriptive stories and provided an inspiring message. He attributes his understanding of the human spirit and its need for nourishment to his experiences as a son, brother, husband,
father, and teacher.&lt;p&gt;
The collection is divided into two parts: part
one, consisting of short stories drawn from
Dillards life; and part two, presenting his poetry. In both, he captures the essence of
the important and interesting experiences of his life thus far. His imagery and tone are
clear in the following excerpt from a longer
poem about his father:&lt;p&gt; 
When We Were Young&lt;p&gt;
He left for work each morning,&lt;br&gt;
Wearing steel-toed boots and a tin hat.&lt;br&gt;
He took long strides that were three times&lt;br&gt;
The length of mine.&lt;br&gt;
In one hand he carried a lunch pail and a thermos.&lt;br&gt;
The other hand was empty,&lt;br&gt;
Like his wallet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Bye-Bye Daddy ..." />
