  <title>Changing the Way You Think - Sheldon Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was during an isolated tour of military duty that the author Sheldon Malone was led to compile these devotionals written over the years into a one-year devotional book designed to encourage readers to look at Gods Word from a whole new perspective by changing the way they thought. It was not until he changed his thinking that he truly began to see the transforming power of God manifested in his life in tangible ways. This is precisely why we have to allow God to expand our territory and horizon by permitting Him to change the way we think through His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read each devotional, this authors prayer is that you will find strength and encouragement to allow God to propel you into higher heights and deeper depths in the things of the Kingdom. The Word of God may just give you a different perspective as it encourages you to change your thinking in order to achieve a new mindset.&lt;/p&gt;" />
