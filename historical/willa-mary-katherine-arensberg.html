  <title>Willa - Mary Katherine Arensberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Willa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By Mary Katherine Arensberg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Comment by Barb Clairhew at the 2008 National Federation of Presswomen in Idaho this September 12: A sense of place and time, told in this case through the convincing voice of an assured and confident writer.  You get the sense that this (story) sprang from the telling and retelling of (a) family narrative orally transmitted through the generations. &lt;br&gt; Willa is an award winning novel! TWICE.  Willa won second place in The National Federation of Press Womens Comminicators Competetion!
In May of 2008 the Arizona Press Women selected Willa to represent their state at the September 12th annual confernece of the National Federation of Press Women in Idaho Falls.
Sept. 6, 2007 Southern Arizona Authors review in the Arizona Daily Star by J.C. Martin: The American Civil War is Willa Rolfs war.  &quot;Willa&quot; (Xlibris, $21.99 paper) by Mary Katherine Arensberg brings to mind Willa Cathers classic &quot;My Antonia,&quot; as another strong Midwestern woman takes over the management of the family farm.  But (Willa) Rolfs life adds highlights - a love story and an involvement with the Civil War.
***Sept. 10, 2007 Columbus Messenger Westside review by Sandi Latimer, staff writer: Arensberg has a strong character and believable story line.  For those who enjoy a good Civil War era story, this book can be a page turner. &quot;Willa&quot; can be purchased through Xlibris for under $20.
***Look for Willas ad in Blue and Gray Magazine
***NEW FAN MAIL!!*** A gold star for Willa, I dont like to read, but I couldnt put it down.  Paula A, Newark, Ohio
***FAN MAIL!*** I totally enjoyed reading Willa.  You need to publish all the other books youve already written! I read a few chapters every night and I would tell my husband, &quot;Well, lets see what Willa is up to tonight!&quot; since she was such a real person to me!  Sharon Davis-Reynoldsburg, Ohio
*****Willa earns a Five Star Review from Readers Favorite!
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 1860s Setting include rural Ohio, Chicago, the southern battlefields of William Sheridan, the Eastern Theater of war and Washington City. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The outbreak of the Civil War marks the opening of a military camp just miles from Willa Rolfs farm and the daily news of the battles come right to her front door. The story is told from three different experiences, Willa at home, her brother Louie on the march to Atlanta with General Sherman and the battlefields in the east through the eyes of Artist Matthew Alison. As the nation is in crisis so is Willas once orderly life; and the burning question is, will she ever find true love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The war reaches a crescendo and Willa just has to do something to help. Time speeds by, General Lee surrenders and then the nation mourns President Lincolns  assassination.  
Willa is a survior and as all good stories should end, she realizes her hearts desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
