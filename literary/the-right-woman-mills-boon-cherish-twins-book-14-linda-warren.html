          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Sarah Welch didn&#39;t know she had a twin until five years ago, when a string of events led her through the seedy underbelly of Dallas to the family she didn&#39;t know she had.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah has spent those five years trying to forget what she went through - forget the man who was gunned down, the criminal she helped put behind bars and the cop who saved her life. Now Sarah is in danger once again. And while this time she&#39;s able to confide her fears to her twin sister, there&#39;s only one person who can truly help her - Daniel Garrett, the cop who never stopped loving her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Working by Daniel&#39;s side to stop a killer, Sarah begins to accept Daniel as part of her past. And part of her future…&lt;/p&gt;
