          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Emily Barrow once dreamed that she could marry Stephen Chesterfield, the Earl of Whitmore, and be saved from her dreary life. Then Stephen&#39;s father sent him away, leaving Emily broken-hearted. . .&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Stephen has returned to find Emily destitute and alone. He has vowed to help her without compromising her honor. . . but Emily has other ideas. She doesn&#39;t want his charity, but she does long to know what it would be like to take him as a lover, even if marriage is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confined to close quarters with their passion burning as brightly as ever, will Stephen be able to resist the temptation and rescue her, or give in to his desire and completely ruin her?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;A prequel to THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS by Michelle Willingham.&lt;/em&gt;
