&lt;br /&gt;
We Were the Lucky Ones is the first book release from author Georgia Hunter. We Were the Lucky Ones tells the true story of Hunter&amp;#39;s family, the Kurc family. The story takes place in Poland in 1939. Even though the Nazis are growing bigger and coming closer to the family&amp;#39;s hometown, they go on trying to live as normal a life as they can. Soon, however, they are unable to ignore what is going on in Europe. The members of the Kurc family are separated and must try to survive this horrific time in history on their own. One child makes an attempt at escaping from Europe, others are sent to live in the ghetto, working on farms or in factories for the Nazis, and one child is exiled. Even in the darkest times, the family does not lose their hope, shrewdness, or inner strength.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We Were the Lucky Ones became a national bestseller upon its release in 2017. In 2017, it was also nominated for two Goodreads Choice Award in the Historical Fiction and Debut Goodreads Author categories.&lt;br /&gt;
