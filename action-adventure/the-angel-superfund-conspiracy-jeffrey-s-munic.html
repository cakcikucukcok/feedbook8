  <title>The Angel Superfund Conspiracy - Jeffrey S. Munic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp There are more than 1,200 Superfund sites on the EPA&#39;s National Priority List, and for each of these sites, there is a story. Associated with the worst US waste sites are tales of heartbreak; tales of corporate carelessness, negligence, and greed; tales of illness; and sometimes tales of death. Usually a version of those tales is contrived for the public and another version remains untold - known only to corporate insiders, their legal counsel, and their environmental consultants. This book reveals an untold story.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp Jim Stern is a rookie environmental engineer, who is compelled to uncover a conspiracy by Tetralex Corporation, a military defense contractor. With the aid of organized crime, Tetralex is deceiving the EPA and the public, while a pool of toxic chemicals collects beneath neighboring homes causing illness and death. Stern must outwit Tetralex and avoid being killed by the Mafia to expose the deadly clandestine plot..&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp Nearby, John Tavish, an irate community member turned eco-terrorist, lost his daughter to cancer as a result of the toxic chemicals lurking beneath his home. Tavish is building a basement laboratory to manufacture the chemicals that will allow him to exact his revenge, but he needs to act swiftly before going mad from the chemical exposure.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp The Angel Superfund Conspiracy will immerse you deeply into the world of environmental engineering exploring hazardous waste site issues from the unique perspectives of the corporate polluters, their lawyers, and their consultants. It is a story that only an insider could tell." />
