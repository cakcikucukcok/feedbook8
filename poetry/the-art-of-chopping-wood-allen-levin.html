  <title>The Art of Chopping Wood - Allen Levin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I got the inspiration to write the Art of Chopping Wood after going through a hard time in my life. During this time I had to look deep inside myself to find my strength and who I am. This book is written from real life and the writings are backed with real emotion. My book is not necessarily a traditional poetry book it is inspired by my own journey, what I went through, how I processed my lessons and evolved because of it. As you read the poems in this book you will find writings of pain and dark times, feelings on love, astounding strength and symbolisms for life. My hope is that my poems can help you get through a tough time or provide hope and inspiration in times of adversity." />
