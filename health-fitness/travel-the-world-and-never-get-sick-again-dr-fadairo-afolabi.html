  <title>Travel the World and Never Get Sick Again - Dr. Fadairo Afolabi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Join Dr. Fadairo Afolabi on her amazing world ventures, as she takes you through her journey discovering health, well being and spirituality. She maps out very simple and prolific steps on how we can ward off sickness and ill health as we enjoy our vacations and travel throughout the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Using natural therapies, she explains the process and background information on what we need to do to stay healthy when traveling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Afolabi has been an advocate for natural health for over 50 years, being taught by her late father, Rev. Eugene J. Robinson. She states, My father would always say, Life is a wonderful journey.  And I say today Without your health and well being, that journey could turn into a bad trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you have ever gone through a wrenching stomach virus, painful muscles and joints, severe headaches or serious diarrhea when traveling, this book is for you. Many people get ill (sometimes violently ill) from food and water that the body has rejected. This happens quite often when traveling to foreign countries. One of the most famous examples of this is Montezumas Revenge, a condition caused by ingesting bacteria and toxins. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; This pocket-size resource guide can be useful at home as well as when traveling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Whether traveling in or out of the country, the natural products stated in this book will help you stay well, boost your immune system, and relish and enjoy your travel experience. Surprisingly, you may have many of these products in your spice cabinet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When you are at your optimal health, you may even experience a spiritual journey that may lead to a greater appreciation of the world. Travel well my friends!! &lt;/p&gt;" />
