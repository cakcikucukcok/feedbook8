  <title>Shiokari Pass - Ayako Miura, Bill Fearnehough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Based on a true story, &lt;I&gt;Shiokari Pass&lt;/I&gt; is a moving tale of love eclipsed by sacrifice and tragedy.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The hero of this Japanese novel is the young and idealistic Nobuo Nagano, who finds himself forced to make a heart-rending decision, when he must choose between his childhood sweetheart, Fujiko, and his newly found Christian faith. Set in Hokkaido at the turn of the nineteenth century, when for the first time Western culture and ideas were beginning to challenge Japan&#39;s long-held traditions, Shiokari Pass takes an intriguing look at Japanese life and thought of a hundred years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Filled with drama and featuring a spectacular climax amidst the snows of Hokkaido, the book was a bestseller in Japanese and a successful motion picture as well. Based on the life of a high-ranking railway employee who was revered for his humanitarian deeds, &lt;I&gt;Shiokari Pass&lt;/I&gt; offers a revealing glimpse of the long, hard road traveled by Japanese Christians.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
