      <meta name="description" content="CANCERA Message of Hope - chronicles Jairo lvarez-Boteros fight against a cancerous monster living inside him. From diagnosis of prostate cancer at age sixty-eight to surgery and cure, Jairo describes in a strikingly honest manner what men can expect after a diagnosis of prostate cancer and the best solutions to help men live a long and healthy life.
After six years of research, Jairo amassed his knowledge and experience into an inspirational story that will not only motivate men to make the best decision for themselves, but will help them and families to keep a positive attitude throughout their ordeal so that they can enjoy what Jairo calls a newlife.
Filled with factual information gleaned from numerous experts around the country, Jairo answers every question a man, woman or family member could have about this insidious disease that is the Number Two killer of men in the United States. Known as The Silent Killer, and what the author calls The Monster, prostate cancer affects more than a quart of million men each year. In the time it takes you eat lunch approximately fi ve men: husbands, brothers, grandfathers, sons will die needlessly from prostate cancer. No men should die of prostate cancer, Jairo said.
No stone is left unturned as Jairo investigates all of the issues a man might face as he contemplates the best course of action. From discussions about temporary incontinence and erectile dysfunction to radical surgery versus chemotherapy and radiation, the author bares his soul so that other men can make the best choices for their individual situations.
From the fear that men experience upon diagnosis to possible treatments and side effects, Jairo uses his experience to help men make the right decisionthe decision to live. While many men have a fear of this cancer, this inspirational book dispels all of the myths and rumors and shows men that not only can they live, but that they can live a full, happy, healthy life, a life that was even better than beforea newlife.
