  <title>Recovering from Sexual Assault  by Family Members: Breaking Generational Curses - Rachael Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You have been penetrated&amp;hellip; This is why you&amp;rsquo;ve picked up the book. Your world has been infected by the Department of Family Protective Services (&amp;ldquo;the department&amp;rdquo;) and you have very little control. Making matters worse: you were deceived from inside your home. Breaking Generational Curses: When Child Protective Services Takes Your Children is the truth that the department is not an easy system. It is; however, an organization with bureaucracy, money and time. Those three components place parents and families at an unfair advantage. The challenge of systems, processes, para professionals and legalities are no place to learn how to win a losing battle. State by state; including international countries, Canada, Australia and the UK, are in a delude. CPS&amp;rsquo;s and federal funding are a mix for Too-Big-To-Fail. This system, is your reality now. This happened on your watch&amp;hellip; trouble is here. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take prayer. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take action. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take Breaking Generation Curses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book series, Breaking Generation Curses is a pentalogy. The pentalogy includes 1) Pedophilia Erotica: Closeup . Sexual Assault by Family Members , 2)Children Recovering from Sexual Assault by Family Members 3) Understanding Psychological Assessments and Decoding Language Workbook4) Breaking Generational Curses When Child Protective Services Takes Your Children : The Return, and 5) Breaking Generational Curses When Child Protective Services Takes Your Children: The Original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wave of new predatory acts done toward children of ages 15 -18 years of age. I believe this is due to the information of technology phase, child pornography and our global world. Children are categorized by sexual offenders in myriad of ways; however, sex trafficking and sexual indecencies of the particular ages of 15- 18 years of age has now turned its focus on cultural dating. Willful dating of this age bracket with intimate partners of adult ages. And I know that some of the ages of the adult can range from 26 to 51. It&amp;rsquo;s just one technique, one more opportunity and effort to over expose our children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, mingle this tragedy with a family member and the Department of Family Protective Services. &amp;nbsp;Families are not able to regroup and survive. &amp;nbsp;And indeed, there are traps, excuses and cultural fads that subvert the natural and genetic urges of teens to understand desire/sexual knowledge. Futher, the exposures and traps we never thought possible so that offenders take advantage of our children at the early ages of infancy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what comes out of a culture of acceptance on one hand is the critical judgment of parents on the other hand. &amp;nbsp;And, as mothers and fathers, if we are unable to recognize&amp;nbsp;diseased pedophilic&amp;nbsp;adults when we can...... the repercussion can be devastating for families. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy family dynamic comes from understanding yours and your parent&amp;rsquo;s past, legacy and how to successfully move forward in your life. Family dynamic is more often about parents rather than parent-ing. Parents and children learn to dialogue and communicate based on the success rate of parents dialoging and communicating with each other. In other words, a stimulus approach based on principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a decade of DFPS, Dr. Robertson&amp;#39;s books are electrifying, heartbreaking and what&amp;#39;s more, educational in preparing families for a fight.Your Children the Original and When Child Protective Services Takes Your Children the Return. Dr. Robertson teaches her supporters how to regain control, survive a broken system and flagrant acts of destroying families.
