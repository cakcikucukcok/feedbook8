  <title>Fundamentals of Flying Star Feng Shui - Ulrich Wilhelm Lippelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Different schools of Flying Star Feng Shui teach different methods. To understand their different concepts and to decide which system to follow, it is necessary to know the fundamentals on which Flying Star Feng Shui is based. The fundamentals of Flying Star Feng Shui are the Time Factor, The Facing Direction and the Interaction of the Five Elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Time Factor of buildings represented by the so-called Time Stars, which are the strong fundamental directional energies in a building, captured in it during a particular period in time. Depending on the teaching of different schools the Time Factor can be the period of construction, the period in which the occupants have moved in or a period presently in command. The book explains these different systems and on what they are based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facing Direction is the direction from which the strongest energy enters a building and spreads throughout it. As energies enter a building through all its openings from many different directions, it is most important to identify the direction from which the strongest energy enters. The Facing Direction depends on three factors, the direction of maximum energy in the environment, the exposure of the building to the external environment and the internal structure of a building, which enables the energies to spread with ease throughout it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong energy of the Facing Directions is represented by the Facing Stars which in combination with the Time Stars create dominating energy combinations, which can be beneficial or harmful to the occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction of these energies with each other happens in accordance with the system of the Five Elements, which are the five ways, in which the overall creative cosmic energy is active. The system of the Five Elements allows us to influence the energies in a building to our advantage by weakening the destructive and enhancing the beneficial ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different traditional Chinese schools of Feng Shui have different and sometimes conflicting views on the Time Factor, the Facing Direction and the interaction of the Five Elements. The book explains these diverse views for the reader to understand on what they are based and thereby helps to come to a decision, which system to follow to achieve the best results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book gives valuable information on how to correctly apply Flying Star Feng Shui, which can help to protect us from unfair competition, economic and professional failure, failing health and unwarranted legal and other charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying Star Feng Shui is based on identifying the strongest of all the different energies, which enter a building through its openings from many different directions at different times, because the strongest energies have the strongest influence on the lives of the occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying Star Feng Shui therefore deals with the time factor of buildings represented by the so-called time stars, which are the strong basic directional energies in a building, captured in it during a specific period in time. The facing direction is the direction from which the strongest energy enters a building and spreads throughout it. This energy is represented by the facing stars which in combination with the time stars create strong energy combinations, which can be beneficial or harmful to the occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
