  <title>Legal Slavery - Aspi Maneckjee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Legal Slavery Divine Justice
	By writing this book I would like to bring to public attention and awareness that slavery is common in the 21st Century, please refer to website: (http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0309/feature1/index.html). 
	I am a victim of a different scheme where I have been treated as a slave by my separated wife and her male friend and guru using the judicial system of family law which has made me homeless, and in debt.
	Due to my ex-wifes unrighteous and immoral lifestyle prior to marriage, and later her joining a New Age Reike Cult in Ottawa with beliefs Universe will provide without working, single parenthood, love everyone; she decided to leave the marriage and abandoned me with with the help from her lawyer with lies and untruths in her affidavits that I was controlling and abusive.  Before she abandoned me she was  practicing  in the field of Reike, psychic healing, black magic and herbal medicine.  She quit her executive job, and then abandoned me on May 9th 1997.   After which, with the help of her male friend and guru and dishonest lawyer, my wife lived off me by receiving spousal and child payments, and has taken all I have worked and saved during the past 30 years.  She refused to work and did not provide medical evidence to the court that she was unable to work.  
	I am a simple righteous, religious and educated man, and I live by the tenets of my Zoroastrian religion which are opposite to her New age beliefs.  My separated wife, and her male friend are responsible for my present New Age slavery.  On October 3rd, 2003, at the Superior Court of Justice (Family Court) in Ottawa, I  made a request to the Madam Justice during my defense that &quot;Justice should be based on truths and not on untruths&quot;, to which a Madam Justice replied as follows: An officer of the court, the lawyer (representing my estrange wife), can say untruths or lies in order to win the case, and make money for his client and himself.
	Repercussions from such an action by an officer of the court, namely telling lies, have been very serious to me; as, for the past thirteen years  I have suffered extreme mental and psychological cruelty in terms of having no life, financial hardships, and also my daughter has been separated from me.   
	The bag of tricks used by my wifes lawyers to increase the settlement were very painful, mentally cruel and devastating to me. Initially my wife did not provide financial disclosure for very long time, and then I lost my lawyer as he joined a high tech company.  After which my wifes lawyer went for a trial, and I was told 2 weeks prior to that and hence had to get a new lawyer. A  settlement was reached at the eve of the trial where the disclosure for the settlement from my wife was minimal. Then my wife garnished my CSCOOP bank account when I was away from the country on a Zoroastrian historical and religious tour of Persia in spring of 2003. This happened despite my letter to my wifes lawyer stating that I will be away from Ottawa for 3 weeks, then hire a lawyer and pay the settlement.  Garnishment was purposely done, as I could not afford to hire a lawyer to defend myself without money.  After that, I went through very difficult time financially, and had no money to pay bills for over 8 weeks, and had to borrow money at high interest rate to continue living.  During this period, my wifes lawyer brought in 2 more motions to the court and won as I represented myself.  The motions included occupancy rent, and  exclusive rights to sell the house, and they also prevented me to purchase my own home twice by increasing the settlement amounts falsely.
	After that, my wifes lawyer made me look bad in the eyes of the Judge by making false accusations that I was interfering with the sale of the house etc; and for nearly 3 years they did not sell the house to make interest on the settlement, and also to collect the occupancy rent each month.  Eventually the house was sold" />
