  <title>Call to Arms - Claude Wayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;B&gt;Is Call To Arms destined to be a movie?&lt;B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 It was 1860, that year before the war, when Johnny, a thirty-year-old eligible
        bachelor from Ohio, traveled to South Carolina to help his uncle run a small plantation
        and fell in love with Molly, a Southern belle from Charleston.
Their plans to marry
        are abruptly interrupted by her jealous former fiance at the outbreak of the Civil War. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Their struggle to return to each others arms is filled with action, adventure, terror,
        charm, compassion, intrigue, suspense, and unceasing desire.  The story has all of the
        elements one would expect in a movie produced by Mel Gibson, including the plot, character,
        humor, history, patriotism, passion, romance, and spirituality for which the highly successful
        actor-producer-director has come to be admired. Call to Arms is a novel surpassing even the greatest Civil War classics for total entertainment value. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Reviews&lt;B&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;I was totally stunned at how well it was written and how good the storyline was.  I couldnt put it down to go to sleep.&quot;
A connoisseur of historical and western novels&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&quot;A valuable document that will historically inform... contains powerful truths to fortfy our souls, stimulate our minds, and provide a path to ease a troubled spirit.&quot;
Anonymous publisher&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Im impressed with how much imagination went into the story.  And what great characters... fun and delightful.  There isnt a dull page in it.&quot;
A &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; buff&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Thank you for reminding me of the important things in life.&quot;
