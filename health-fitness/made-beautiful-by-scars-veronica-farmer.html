  <title>Made Beautiful by Scars - Veronica Farmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Veronica Farmer was diagnosed with extensive cancer just days before her wedding, and it was a powerful life scar for her. &lt;i&gt;Made Beautiful by Scars&lt;/i&gt; started with the idea of Farmer sharing how cancer made her more beautiful. She then realized hosts of other womens lives are molded by their own scars.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this collection, she shares her story and the stories of twenty-two other women who have lived through trauma that did not break them. The narratives show how the tragedies they encountered grew them, expanded their beauty into a whole new realm, and touched many others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From Nicky who suffered the pain of infertility, to Kate who battled melanoma, and to Amanda who became a paraplegic, &lt;i&gt;Made Beautiful by Scars&lt;/i&gt; captures raw stories from Farmer and other women who have faced all types of life scars and been made stronger. Farmer shines a light on the unimaginable strength of women, survivors who have been empowered by adversity and challenge.&lt;/P&gt;" />
