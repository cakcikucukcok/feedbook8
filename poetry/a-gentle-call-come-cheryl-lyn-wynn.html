  <title>A Gentle Call—Come - Cheryl Lyn Wynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God brings light to the mystery hidden in the ages, His manifold wisdom in pages of time with rulers and authorities in heavenly places. Building on this idea, author Cheryl Lyn Wynn explores in verse how the love of God falls from above to fill our hearts and how the knowledge of God and the glory of the Lord profoundly change our lives in many ways. All power in heaven is given in majesty and might. Called to a particular time and anointed by heaven, we are given life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering revelation, enlightenment, salvation, and love, the poems and psalms of &lt;i&gt;A Gentle CallCome&lt;/i&gt;capture the essence of our relationship with God. In our hearts the Holy Spirit will sow kindness, truth, and wisdom; Christ will lead our spirits and souls in peace, mercy, and grace. Jesus Christ is calling a gentle callcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation Proclaim&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Come to me, into my arms and sing a different song;&lt;br&gt;
A song about our great God to whom we do belong.&lt;br&gt;
Sing for joy and for thanksgiving, hold your banner high.&lt;br&gt;
Praise and adoration for the Lord, my King  I;&lt;br&gt;
I will bless His name forever, salvation to proclaim.&lt;br&gt;
Splendor and majesty ascribe His Holy Name.&lt;br&gt;
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord on high.&lt;br&gt;
Holy, Holy, Holy wickedness defy.&lt;br&gt;
Break forth and sing His praises, shout before the mighty King  &lt;br&gt;
Praises to the Lord doth my spirit sing.&lt;br&gt;
Worship at His feet down on bended knee.&lt;br&gt;
Enter into His gates and you will truly see  &lt;br&gt;
His everlasting loving kindness and His bountiful grace;&lt;br&gt;
In His precious presence you will clearly see His face.&lt;br&gt;
Come into my blessedness and spend some time with me;&lt;br&gt;
I will hold you in my arms and set your spirit free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
