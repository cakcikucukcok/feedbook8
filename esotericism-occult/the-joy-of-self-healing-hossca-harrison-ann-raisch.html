  <title>The Joy of Self Healing - Hossca Harrison, Ann Raisch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These healing messages from Jonah give an understanding of the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual bodies. Jonah gives recipes to assist you in understanding and healing everything from anxiety to vision using breathing exercises, meditations, and natural remedies. If you want to take charge of your own healing, this is the book for you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ye, my friend, must be willing to take total and complete responsibility for all ye create, to love your creation, to love yourself, to love your earth, and when this is done, to accept yourself as a master. Do not do this for ego aggrandizement, for a master does not carry an ego. The master does not carry fear. Masters live their own teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin joining with those of the light; with those of truth. Begin making the decision ye are worth the universe, because ye are not separated from it. Become again as a child, for a master knows how to play. Become a student, for a master knows there is no end to learning. Become a teacher, for a master knows that to teach loving is the greatest contentment ye will ever find in all eternity. Become one with the source. Become one with truth, your truth, your individual truth, your personal truth. Become one with the universe and, truly, on your journey to mastership youll never walk alone.  - Jonah&lt;/p&gt;" />
