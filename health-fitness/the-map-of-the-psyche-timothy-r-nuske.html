  <title>The Map of the Psyche - Timothy R. Nuske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;For more than half his life, author Tim Nuske thought he was crazy. During a certain ten-year period and beyond, he could have fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for at least half of the close to 400 mental disorders described in psychiatrys billing bible, the DSM. Building on these experiences, Nuske presents a thought-provoking theory of the mind and how it relates to mental illness, a widespread social concern affecting countless millions. But are such experiences a real biological illness or brain disease? Are they caused by a chemical imbalance or genetic defect? And what does the mind have to do with a &lt;i&gt;mental&lt;/i&gt; illness/disorder/disease? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Following a life changing experience and spiritual awakening Tim entered university to study psychology, intent on gaining a better understanding of his own madness and the mind, and to help others with what he had learned. &lt;i&gt;The Map of the Psyche: The Truth of Mental Illness&lt;/i&gt; is the result of four years of research and over a decade of personal experience with mental illness. He had to be mental to map the mind. Psychologists and philosophers have been trying to understand the mind for hundreds of years: Tim mapped it in under three (plus a lifetime of prior experience). Offering an alternative to psychiatric labelling and drugging, he shares what he considers to be a more accurate and effective approach to mental health care.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The truth is in the psyche. The truth is found within.&lt;/p&gt;" />
