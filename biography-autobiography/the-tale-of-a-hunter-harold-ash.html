  <title>The Tale of a Hunter - Harold Ash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In my lifetime I have harvested over two hundred deer and many other animals and birds, and that doesnt even count the fish species from coast to coast. I want to leave something to my family to remember me by. As of now, I have five grandkids that are somewhat interested in what I do. They show interest in the shooting sports and archery and fishing. With the fishing, they all have mounted fish I did for them on their walls. I do not push any children into hunting unless they approach me or their parents. My oldest granddaughter showed interest in archery, so when she graduated grammar school, I bought her first recurve bow. Right now she shows no interest in hunting, and thats perfectly OK. 
My oldest grandson just joined the Boy Scouts and has shot rifles and shot compound bows and now is interested in a compound bow. Last year he asked to go turkey hunting, and I hope he enjoyed the experience. And we didnt kill anything. We already picked out the bow. 
My three younger grandchildrentwo are eight-year-olds and one is nine-year-oldare interested in target shooting the BB gun and archery shooting. They go for hikes with me to look for shed antlers. All my grandchildren are interested in fishing and all-around activities. My journey will continue to hone their skills in archery and firearms, and hopefully, they might be interested in hunting. My journey is far from over, God willing." />
