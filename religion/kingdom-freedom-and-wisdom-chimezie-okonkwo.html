  <title>Kingdom, Freedom and Wisdom - Chimezie Okonkwo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kingdom, freedom and wisdom are three-in-one forces that the trinity chose to display the wealth of their treasure to man within his environment both spiritually and physically. In Kingdom, Freedom and Wisdom, author Chimezie Okonkwo discusses these three forces through his testimony of the Word of God.
Drawing from his life experiences, the Word of God and his pilgrimage tour of the Holy Land of Israel, Okonkwo provides a detailed discussion of the kingdom of God, the freedom of Jesus and the wisdom of the Holy Spirit. He shares how they operate in different forms, beginning with the work of God from the beginning of creation when he established his kingdom and going through the conception of Jesus, his birth, death, burial and resurrection, which subsequently ensured freedom for mankind. He then advances to the spiritual realm, where our faith and righteousness by grace become dependent on the wisdom of the spirit to actualize spiritual declarations, bringing them into the physical. 
Employing an array of Bible verses, Kingdom, Freedom and Wisdom explains how the trinity controlled, influenced, affected, enhanced, manipulated, subjected, united and dominated the ministry of Jesus through its three individual and original forces and treasures: kingdom, freedom and wisdom." />
