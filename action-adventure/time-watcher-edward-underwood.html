  <title>Time Watcher - Edward Underwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Back when there were no white menand when the Indians were freethere existed no forces, no posted signs, and no government. But for a Choctaw tribe in present-day Louisiana, the bonds of family and community would provide all the order and safety they needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Watcher tells the story of a young Choctaw boy whose spirit was different than all the rest, and its a story about a young man who must eventually risk it all to save his family and his tribe. Opening with the details of young Time Watchers idyllic life living with the land and learning native skills from his parents, a story of love, friendship, and adventure begins to unfold. Time Watcher must save his mother and his sister, Mourning Dove and Little Dove, from a warlike tribe of Cherokee Indians, and his quest to eventually become a medicine man is beset with pitfalls and challenges that he must overcome with his knowledge, courage, and determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join young Time Watcher and his tribesmen, friends, and family as they live with the land and join together in spirit, even coming together as warriors to defend themselves and neighboring tribes in battle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
