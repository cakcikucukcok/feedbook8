  <title>Creating Eartheaven in Your Life Profound Transformation of Your Soul - David H. Fastiggi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Creating Eartheaven in Your Life is unique and it is innate in all human beings. Humanitys quest for a wholesome peaceful life goes unabated. Our search for our better self that identifies with the reality of the world we live in all too often filled with grief and stress is juxtaposed with faith and hope for change or a miracle.
Do we just have faith expecting God will deliver humanity from the ills we have caused? Should we just buckle down and be practical seeking solution with our rational self?
What kind of God do we actually know or are we seeking a relationship with an image of God taught to us. What is the divine matrix and does a personal God speak to us?  Science stands for one view of creation and faith stands for another? Is there a joining point of the two?
Has our species Homo sapiens stalled out in evolutionary development? Is the world becoming a village of cooperation and mutual peace seeking? Can we continue the way we have been and survive our own arrogance? 
What is the future of faith, religion and spirituality? 
The author in a comprehensive way takes us on a journey to explore answers to these questions and much more. Eartheaven is a paradigm of integration between the souls development and our biological body and by extension all creation. He delves into scientific reality while preserving in the beginning God created. 
Creating Eartheaven in Your life is a deep exploratory of the souls life in the experience of hurt and suffering and the potential for there to be personal divine human embodiment and therefore earth peace. Through ten fundamental teaching combining Jesus words of two thousand years ago, an Aramaic understanding, the authors revelatory experience in an apparition of Jesus, his 44 years life experience, psychology and science, your reading and learning experience will be a challenge and liberation of the soul. Profound transformation is needed and this codex offers the leverage needed to shift our life course towards personal awakening and transformation as well as providing a blue print for future generations.
Creating Eartheaven in Your Life brings us into universal principles of life, a meeting for humanity without walls. This volume of two, addresses specifically transformation of the soul, heaven unfolding. Volume two addresses transformation of the body representing the earth and thus eartheaven.
Granted this book is not an easy read but proves to be a strong mirror reflecting back to us our lives and what we can become fulfilling humanitys evolutionary life potential and perhaps vital to our survival as a people." />
