  <title>Fear to Love - Jadyn Patrilita Petimara Ualesi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Zekiahs boyfriend of four years, Ben, was always there when she needed support, even though he had been cheating on her with her cousin, Ainsley. Zekiah still wanted him to be a part of her life since he was the only one who knew how to contain her anger.
And then a guy moved in next door. 
Zekiah didnt know what she was getting caught up in. She thought that with the new guy moving in with his family, her life would still be peaceful and quiet. What she didnt know was that the closer she was to the new guy, the more trouble she would find herself in because of him. And she loved every minute of it. Almost.
Follow Zekiah and Jarons on-again, off-again tumultuous relationship. Every time you think you have them figured out, life throws them another curveball. See if you can keep up with their insane lives that came crashing together under the most unusual circumstances." />
