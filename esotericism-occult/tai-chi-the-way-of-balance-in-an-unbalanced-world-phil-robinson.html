  <title>Tai Chi: the Way of Balance in an Unbalanced World - Phil Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With a picture of Mr. Robinson teaching his grandson, the back page reads:&quot;Mr. Robinson, a Master of Yang Tai Chi, had undertaken two projects. The first is to hand down to his grandson, 46 years of knowledge and experience in the Martial Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is to hand down this knowledge and experience to you through the pages of this book. Much effort has been taken to give the reader a complete guide to Tai Chi in a language that is uncomplicated and yet very detailed. This book is like none of the other books about Tai Chi you have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, written through the eyes of a Master raised in the South, not only tells you of the history and origin of Tai Chi, but explains how Tai Chi can be such a positive influence in your life. The breathing, the relaxation, the harmony, the exercise, the philosophy, the self-defense, the health and healing created in ancient China allcome together in this book as a means to benefit you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a must read for everyone, from the complete novice to the experienced in Tai Chi.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
