I don&#39;t remember every face of every victim, but I remember this: that look in the eyes of someone facing their end, the mixture of fear, resentment, resignation. It was my job, just my job. I stole lives. Now they steal my sleep, my peace of mind, my soul. The men, the women and, God help me, the children. I am a haunted man. This government asked too much from its soldiers. It asked too much from its citizens. It asks too much from me. Now, I&#39;m asking for something. To get my soul back. There are as many ways to disappear as there are people, but no one could have predicted this. Yep. This game ender is for keeps." />
