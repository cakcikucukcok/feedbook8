  <title>The Tragic Life of Olive Oatman: Apache Captive - Robert F. (Bob) Turpin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Apache war party suddenly attacked the unsuspecting Oatman family. With wild yells and war cries, the screaming savages swarmed around their helpless victims, leaving their bodies a bloody mass on the ground. A four-year-old girl was killed instantly with a blow that caved in her skull. Two young girls, Olive and Mary Oatman were spared to become Apache slaves. The two youngsters were dragged away at the end of rawhide ropes. If they fell, they were dragged until they could get back to their feet. The Indians plundered the wagon taking what they wanted, then scattered everything else over the bloodstained ground." />
