  <title>The Complete Much Ado About Nothing - Donald J. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Much Ado About Nothing is a delightful play which pits two intelligent, thinking people against each other, both of whom protest against love (and each other), but who finally come to embrace the other both literally and emotionally.  The contretemps between Beatrice and Benedick is emotionally and intellectually satisfying, partially because the audience is included on the joke but also because it is rewarding to see two strong, independent personalities realize they are incomplete.
	The sub-plot of Heros accusation and final denouement is less satisfying as the accusation is patently unfair.  However, as Shakespeare reminded us another time, alls well that ends well." />
