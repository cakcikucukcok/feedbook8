  <title>Iron House - John Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An old man is dying.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the old man is dead they will come for him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And they will come for her, to make him hurt.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hart has written three &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers and won an unprecedented two back-to-back Edgar Awards. His books have been called &quot;masterful&quot; (Jeffery Deaver) and &quot;gripping&quot; (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;) with &quot;Grisham-style intrigue and Turow-style brooding&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;). Now he delivers his fourth novel--a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping thriller no reader will soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HE WOULD GO TO HELL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Iron Mountain Home for Boys, there was nothing but time. Time to burn and time to kill, time for two young orphans to learn that life isn&#39;t won without a fight. Julian survives only because his older brother, Michael, is fearless and fiercely protective. When tensions boil over and a boy is brutally killed, there is only one sacrifice left for Michael to make: He flees the orphanage and takes the blame with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO KEEP HER SAFE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, Michael has been an enforcer in New York&#39;s world of organized crime, a prince of the streets so widely feared he rarely has to kill anymore. But the life he&#39;s fought to build unravels when he meets Elena, a beautiful innocent who teaches him the meaning and power of love. He wants a fresh start with her, the chance to start a family like the one he and Julian never had. But someone else is holding the strings. And escape is not that easy. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GO TO HELL, AND COME BACK BURNING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mob boss who gave Michael his blessing to begin anew is dying, and his son is intent on making Michael pay for his betrayal. Determined to protect the ones he loves, Michael spirits Elena--who knows nothing of his past crimes, or the peril he&#39;s laid at her door-- back to North Carolina, to the place he was born and the brother he lost so long ago. There, he will encounter a whole new level of danger, a thicket of deceit and violence that leads inexorably to the one place he&#39;s been running from his whole life: Iron House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now with an excerpt of John Hart&#39;s next book &lt;i&gt;The Hush&lt;/i&gt;, available in February 2018.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
