  <title>&quot;Man-Up&quot; Institute Guide - Dr. Marva T. Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Man-Up (Motivating Attitudes that Nurture an Understanding of your Potential Institute Guide) consists of a curriculum guide focusing on strategies and activities to enhance life skills, college and career readiness, utilizing best practices that are responsive to the needs of diverse adolescent males. 
Each module includes research-based best practices about the topics addressed in the module and includes a suggestive PowerPoint presentation that can be utilized for implementation of the module content. The guide also includes an educator-and-parent section with resources to extend knowledge and skills participants learn beyond the institute module session.
Each module delivery format is based upon an adaptive 5E model of teaching and learning (engage, explore, explain, extend, evaluate). The guide also includes a section with sample letters, forms, and templates that can be used to customize the program for your school or organization.
The institute consists of six specific modules, an introductory session, and a final launching for success session. Students will engage in reflective writing utilizing the Man-Up reflective journal (Purchased Separately) throughout the institute. 
The intent of the guide is to serve as life skills, career and college readiness, as well as a prevention-intervention program that supports the continuation of safe and drug-free schools in secondary campuses and career and college readiness preparedness focusing on, but not limited to, the following: 
Increasing academic student performance

Understanding the impact of their culture within the school and community environment
Reducing school violence such as bullying, date violence, and gang violence
Building relational capacity between teacher and student and home and school
Improving self-advocacy, self-determination, and self-motivation
