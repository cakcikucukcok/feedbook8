The plot begins like a romance novel, and i'm not a reader of the genre, so this was quite a surprise to me. It was a rather heavy-handed romance too, I feel the author laid it on thick!<br /><b><i>The Wife Before Me by Laura Elliot - Goodreads</i></b> | Laura Elliot's novels include The Wife Before Me, The Thorn Girl, Sleep Sister, Stolen Child, The Prodigal Sister, Fragile Lies and The Betrayal. Writing as June Considine, she has twelve books for children and young adults. Her short stories have appeared in a number of teenage anthologies and have also been broadcast on the radio.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Wife Before Me: A twisty, gripping ...</i></b> | Laura Elliot was born in Dublin, Ireland. She lives in Malahide, a picturesque, coastal town on the north side of Dublin.
