  <title>Who Pooh Poohed in Your Magic Lamp? - R. Jeannie Self</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Who Pooh Poohed in Your Magic Lamp?&quot; 
R. Jeannie was searching to find the truth to: &quot;Who am I?&quot; And &quot;Man Know Thyself.&quot; She also had a burning desire to, &quot;Know the Truth that will set you Free.&quot; Her quest was not unique, but even she was not fully prepared for the enlightenment that she is now sharing with you. 
She has found the answers to these questions and more. She scoured The Holy Bible, the dictionary, and the web to gain insight and inspiration as she dissected many powerful words and their divinely inspired meanings and intentions. She has discovered and is now sharing information that may cause you to cry and shake in your boots, just as she did. 
R. Jeannie looked up &quot;Genius&quot; and found it meant: &quot;Genie: an attendant spirit allotted to each person at his birth, to attend a person through his life.&quot; This took her to the story of Aladdin and its hidden truths. 
Going to the dictionary again, she found that &quot;I&quot; means &quot;Ego&quot;, and this led her to the &quot;Truth that will set You Free.&quot; She knows that she could not have written this book by herself, she felt divinely inspired. She has unraveled it, not written it, and the truths have been benevolently revealed to her. 
With Bible and dictionary in hand she will take you step by step, unfolding how the story (myth) about Aladdin (A-lad-in his magic lamp) contains hidden truths about Jesus and his mission here on earth. She will show that we all have a &quot;magic lamp&quot; and a &quot;Genie&quot; within us. We are the Lamp and your Genie is the light of Christ, given to be within every person ever born. 
Accept your God given heritage, grasp this gift, and become whole." />
