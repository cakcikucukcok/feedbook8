  <title>Is Anything Happening? - Robin Lustig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the days before mobile phones, the internet and 24-hour news channels, the easiest way for a British foreign correspondent to find out what was going on in the world was to phone the local office of Reuters news agency and ask: &#39;Is anything happening?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s how the award-winning BBC reporter and presenter Robin Lustig started out in journalism, working for Reuters as an agency man. During a distinguished career spanning more than forty years, he watched the world of news change beyond recognition, as he reported on terror attacks, wars and political coups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this witty and illuminating memoir, Lustig looks back on his life as a newsman, from coming under fire in Pakistan to reporting on the fall of the Berlin Wall; from meeting Nelson Mandela to covering Princess Diana&#39;s sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the studio, Lustig lets us in through the BBC&#39;s back door for a candid, behind-the-scenes look at some of his triumphs and disasters working for the nation&#39;s favourite broadcaster. He writes of his childhood as the son of refugees from Nazi Germany and, drawing on thirty years of reporting about the Middle East, he comes to a startling conclusion about the establishment of the state of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astute, incisive and frequently hilarious, &lt;i&gt;Is Anything Happening?&lt;/i&gt; is both an irresistible personal memoir and an insightful reflection on world events over the past forty-five years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
