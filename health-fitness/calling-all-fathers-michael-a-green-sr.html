  <title>Calling All Fathers - Michael A. Green Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CALLING ALL FATHERS is a 911 emergency system designed to compel all males to respond to their roles as fathers. Every man who desires to become committed to, involved with and responsible for his children must respond to this call. Our children must know and understand how important they are to us. Any male can be a dad; it takes a special man to be a father.
CALLING ALL FATHERS is more than just a catchy phrase. It is a mindset and philosophy that all fathers involved in parenting time, custody and child support have to internalize. The most pressing need fathers have is the need for information and support. Many fathers do not understand the many resources available to them. 
CALLING ALL FATHERS is meant to educate, empower, engage and enlightyen these men." />
