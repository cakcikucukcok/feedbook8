  <title>Immaculate Deception - Gary J. Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Patricia Pollard is wealthy, beautiful, and needs Sam McClouds help. Mrs. Pollard is upset by the indiscretions of her preacher husband, Peter Pollard;
    and to make matters worse, her best friends husband, the corporate financial officer of Pollards religious empire, has disappeared. As a private
    investigator in the North-Central California City of Modesto, McCloud struggles to keep his relationship with the gorgeous Mrs. Pollard on a professional
    level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Mac enlists his cousin, Swede Anderson, the owner of the Downtown Athletic Club, to assist in the investigation. The twists and turns extend into Hawaii,
    Mexico, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with treachery everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As Mac and Swede follow a confusing trail of clues in Norman Adkinss disappearance, they discover a network of slavery, drugs, and murder and attempts to
    discourage both of them in the pursuit of the truth. As it turns out, the truth can be stranger than fiction.
