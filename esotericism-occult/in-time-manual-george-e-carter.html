  <title>In Time Manual - George E. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an introduction to John, God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. God the Father gives Jesus the okay to show John things that must come to pass and sends his angel to show John. John witnessed to the world of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ all things that he had seen.
Blessed is he that reads and hears the word of this prophecy, and keep the things written in this book for the time is close.
Now, verses four through seven tell what John is to do. He is to write to the seven churches in Asia. This is from Godhis grace to you and peace and the seven spirits before Gods throne and Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness and first born of the dead and prince of the earth. 
Jesus loves us and washed us in his blood for our sins. He makes us kings and priests to God the fatherto himself glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.
Johns vision of the second coming of the Christ: everyone will see him, and all kindred of the earth will wail because of him. 
He is Alpha and Omega, the first and last, says the Lord, who was and who is and who is to come, the Almighty.
John, a brother in Christ and companion in tribulation, kingdom, and patience of Jesus Christ on the Island of Patmos is to receive the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ." />
