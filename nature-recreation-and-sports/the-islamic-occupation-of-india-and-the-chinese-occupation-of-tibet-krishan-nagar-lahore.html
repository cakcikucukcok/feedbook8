  <title>The Islamic Occupation of India and the Chinese Occupation of Tibet - Krishan Nagar Lahore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There were the days since 0 AD of the occupation of others lands and expansion by the Islamic terrorist armies on the surface of the Earth. For India, it started through Afghanistan in 1000 AD. It lasted many centuries in India, in particular over 10001947 and still continues. It is amazing in 1947 the Islamic occupation of India (Pakistan) was rewarded with the approval of the UNO and the Western democratic countries alike. Since this recent demonstration of the Islamic terrorist might, i.e., the claim of India in 1947, Islam has re-affirmed to the world what it is capable of. It declared its aims in 9/11, 26/11, in the twenty-first century. More and much worse is yet to come. Newly, Islam also boasts of the support of the Communist might (known for violation of the basic human rights), e.g., Russia and China. It looks like the days of the free world, particularly of the divided (religious in 1947 and lingual now) India through insurgency from Islam and the Mongol (Khan)-Communist China are numbered." />
