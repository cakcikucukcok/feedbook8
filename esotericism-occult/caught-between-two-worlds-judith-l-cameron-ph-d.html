  <title>Caught Between Two Worlds: - Judith L. Cameron Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book by Judith Cameron, PhD, is the true story of her ongoing encounters with benevolent extraterrestrials and the education that she has received from them throughout her life. She had a lucid dream that told her that part of her lifes work was to train to be an ambassadora liaison between Earth humans and extraterrestrials when those extraterrestrials came en masse on their first contact mission. &lt;br /&gt;
Follow Judys adventure, from being a child of six and meeting her first extraterrestrials, to the present-day encounters, many of which are a result of her training to become an ambassador to the universe. You will learn about the Galactic Federation of Light and their representatives on Earth who have continued her learning and training. Sheldon Nidle of the Planetary Activation Organization and Dr. Steven Greer, MD, founder of CSETI, are two of the selected teachers whom Judy has chosen to work with.&lt;br /&gt;
Judys encounters have taken her around the globe to places such as Bora Bora, one of the Tahitian Islands, Orpheus Island, Australia on the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii, and the Great Southwest of the United States. Working as a public school teacher for forty years teaching all grade levels and at NASA as an education consultant, along with her work as a doctor of clinical hypnotherapy, has given Judy the background and credibility that she needs to carry out her mission. Follow Judy now as you learn of the wonderful possibilities for our future Earth." />
