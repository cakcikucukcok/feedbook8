  <title>James Dickey - Henry Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fascinating biography of one of the most popular, colorful, and notorious American poets of our century.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The legendary Southern poet James Dickey never shied away from cultivating a heroic mystique.  Like Norman Mailer and Ernest Hemingway, he earned a reputation as a sportsman, boozer, war hero, and womanizer as well as a great poet, novelist, screenwriter, and essayist.  But James Dickey made lying both a literary strategy and a protective camouflage; even his family and closest friends failed to distinguish between the mythical James Dickey and the actual man.  Henry Hart sees lying as the central theme to Dickey&#39;s life; and in this authoritative, immensely entertaining biography he delves deep behind Dickey&#39;s many masks.  Letters, anecdotes, tall tales and true ones, as well as the reluctant but finally candid cooperation of Dickey himself animate Hart&#39;s narration of a remarkable life.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers of Dickey&#39;s National Book Award-winning poetry, his bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;Deliverance&lt;/i&gt;, and anyone who witnessed his electrifying readings of his work will savor this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
