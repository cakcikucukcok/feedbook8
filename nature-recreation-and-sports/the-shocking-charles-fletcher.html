  <title>The Shocking - Charles Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you have an open mind and are seeking a much higher level of understanding the environment this book is for you. This book is for those who are environmentally conscience.
As a resident living in the Victory Heights West Pullman Community under the name Abbas Hassain aka Charles Fletcher, I lived in a corner house on 121st street and Elizabeth Street next door to the International Harvester and Old Dutch Boy contaminated waste site that was later identified as a Brown Field by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The International Harvester property was later sold to the Reverend Johnny Colman for one dollar and she built a church upon much of the contaminated site by sealing off all hazardous materials that was under the area where the church was built. As the Founder of Reduce Recidivism by Industrial Development, Inc. (R.R.I.D), I help organize the Environmental Committee along with Sarah Parran, Cheryl Jackson, and bought Illinois Environmental Agency, Chicago Department of Environment, along with the Chicago Department of Public Health, Illinois Department of Public Health, Owners of International Harvester, and Old Dutch Boy Paint Company and other Community organizations like Community for People Recovery with the Founder Hazel Johnson (The Mother of the Environment) and her daughter Cheryl. Hazel was called to Washington by then President Bill Clinton and Hazel also knew the present President Barrack Obama. Hazel lived in Altgeid Garden on the far south side of Chicago where President Obama had done his community organizing. Hazel Johnson knew both Presidents at a time where change was about to come to America. Hazel had been meeting at Chicago State University for years and invited RRID and the West Pullman Community to attend an environmental meeting and from that point in 1995 RRID help organize The Victory Heights West Pullman Advisory Council. As Chairperson of this environmental group we teamed up with Hazel Johnson at Chicago State University, my focus had been on the impact of environmental hazards associated with those contaminated elements that cause air-borne lead that affected many of the young students in and around the Edward White elementary school that was effected by the Brown Field Contaminated site causing illness, disease, behavior, death and the effects of magnetic energy fields. For many years we worked with Dr. Joseph Balogun now Dean of the Health Science Department at Chicago State University because of the impact of the environmental hazards that was affecting the broader community in the West Pullman and Pullman communities, later we brought in Roseland Community Hospital, Sharon Thurman, Southside Health Consortium Salim AlNurridan and Dr. Thomas Britt, Assistant Dean Balogun, Professor Daniel Block of the Geography Department, with Professor Mark Mauman and students who were interested in environmental education.  Dr. Wayne Watson now President of Chicago State University, we met years earlier when he was President of Kennedy King College who help us to better understand how recidivist behavior played an infallible effect on environmental factors. We began to work with CSU on developing Environmental curriculum for students and professionals that did not have this form of education as part of their studies, rather than medical, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, etc, Today, Chicago State University has implemented the Environmental Curriculum as part of the Universities Environmental Program. This book is dedicated to all those individuals that help to make this program a reality and success. We will forever be grateful for their hard work. I wrote the following articles in an attempt to change the thinking and thought process of all those who read this book. It is my hope that each and everyone that reads this book will be able to see what the author has seen by turning their attention inward to show how our thoughts and the process of thought really works.
