  <title>Unveiling the Mystery of Life and Death - Dr. Sylvie Daniel Bidot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Honest story of personal devastation, healing and spiritual search. Wonderful blending: personal narrative, life lessons, poetry and philosophy, river and ocean as one; river of life flowing into the ocean.  &lt;/i&gt;Brother Satyananda Self-Realization Fellowship&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This book is one of the noblest works that I have ever read. Its theme reveals the magic and inner beauty of the soul of a queen of beauty.&lt;/i&gt; Ghada Samman, a writer, a poetess, and a novelist. Her work has been translated to many languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I was enticed to read the book with an avid desire and taste its overwhelming grief, as though grief dwelt not in my life nor has it shrouded my hearts throbbing. It is a unique love story, pregnant with a cloud that pours down tears instead of water. &lt;/i&gt; Jumanah Taha, a well-known creative writer and poetess&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This book is also an autobiography of the soul that triumphs over the alternating lifes events and affairs; for the soul is but gods rays.&lt;/i&gt; Dr. Issa Boullata, McGill University, Canada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is a concise autobiography, crafted in a charming style reminiscent of a novel, and full of poetic insights.This is the sotry of a woman of strong will and faith, able to pull herself out from the depths of a life of sorrow, anguish and the agony that haunted her following the loss of her beloved son and mother in a tragic accident. She made a conscious decision to continue to lead her peaceful life, fi nding meaning in raising her daughter with the same values she was raised by her own parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Her own keen instincts guided her to seek the works of the great spiritualists, and there she indulged herself in reading and learning much. I found it a joy to read Dr. Sylvies book and to learn of the wisdom derived from her own unique personal experiences.&lt;/i&gt;Dr. Bassam Frangieh, Yale University" />
