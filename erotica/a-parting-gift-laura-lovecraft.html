  <title>A Parting Gift - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jay is excited to be leaving for college, but is going to miss his friends and family. He&#39;s also going to miss Wendy, his hot milf neighbor. He&#39;s been dreaming about Wendy since the day he met her and probably will even after he moves. What Jay doesn&#39;t know is Wendy&#39;s been doing some dreaming of her own and has a special parting gift for her cute neighbor.
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
“What’s the matter, Jay?” she asked, while touching my cheek and caressing my face with her long nails, “You shocked I played with my pussy in front of you?”
“I…yeah.” I nodded, my heart pounding and my cock swelling between my legs.
I wasn’t the only person turned on. Wendy’s hard nipples were obvious through the thin robe and her eyes were roaming up and down my body.
“I did say I had another gift for you and that was part of it.” She stepped so close her breasts pushed against me. “The show you always wanted.”
“Well I…”
“I know you watch me. I’ve caught you so many times, you and all your friends staring at Wendy, the teasing milf.” she laughed, “Isn’t that right, Jay?”
“Yes.” I answered softly as she placed her hands on my chest.
“I am a teaser. I love it; I love men looking at me. I love knowing they get hard and either jerk off or bang their wives thinking of me.”
She lowered her eyes and smiled. I followed her gaze and saw my hard on was obvious in my shorts. I gasped when she lowered her hand and grabbed it.
“Oh, baby.” She purred, “This for your naughty neighbor?”
“Oh, yeah.” I whispered as she rubbed my aching shaft through the shorts. Was she still teasing? Please don’t let her be teasing, I thought while she continued to rub me.
“Good, because I have a nice wet hole that even getting off couldn’t slow down, because this,” she squeezed my pole, “Is what I really need.” She leaned forward and surprised me when she brushed her soft lips across mine, “See anything you need, Jay?”
“I see…” I looked down and watched her hand rubbing my cock. I was ready to tell her I needed anything she wanted to give me, but stopped when my eyes found the silver band around her finger. “Wait.”
“Wait?” Her blue eyes widened. “That’s not the answer I was waiting for.”
“You’re married.”
“Nothing gets past you, sweetie.” She laughed, “Don’t worry about it.”
“But he…”
“He knows.” She squeezed me again, “So let’s just have some fun.”
“He’s okay with it?”
“Yes.” She sighed and her hand stopped moving, but remained resting on my still hard shaft.
“You’re a good kid, Jay you proved that by worrying about this, but Ron knows I need far more than he can give me and he’s okay with me fooling around when he is out of town, we never talk about it, but he knows.”
“So you’re…a hotwife?” Holy shit, that damn perv Luke was right!
Wendy laughed, “I suppose you can say that, but I like cougar better because I do love my cubs.” She resumed rubbing my shaft.
“See baby, if I’m going to step out I don’t want to do it with another guy my age, I want a nice hard young one, a hung young stud who can bang me long and hard and as many times as I need it.”
“Goddamn.” I gasped when she grabbed my wrist and shoved my hand into her robe.
“I have to be careful though, can’t bring them here so I go out to bars, and find me a young boy to play with and grab a motel and let them bang me all night long.” She moaned louder when my fingers zeroed in on her swollen nipple and rubbed it.
“I’ve had my eye on you, sexy.” She purred as she held her hand over mine pushing it harder against her tit.
“Thought about giving you a special eighteenth birthday gift, but with you living next door, I’d be tempted to bang you all the time and I can’t do that.”" />
