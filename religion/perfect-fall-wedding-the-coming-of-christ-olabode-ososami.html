  <title>Perfect Fall Wedding: The Coming of Christ - Olabode Ososami</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the Bible about?  The Bible is about a fall wedding. Decades ago, many found the theme of &quot;Preparing for the return of Christ&quot; rather dour but not anymore.  The mood has since changed. Today there is renewed interest in eschatology and understanding readiness for what God is preparing our minds for - the End Times. There is a strong sense of something new coming, something imminent that we have never seen or could ever conceive ... and the wise need to be prepared. Many heed the cry to return to the pathway of holiness as we approach the end of the world as we know it.  The Jewish Feast of Trumpets, the first of the fall feasts, foretells a coming Royal Marriage of the Messiah - ushered by the Rapture of the saints.   &quot;&quot;The Perfect Fall Wedding:The Coming of Christ&quot;&quot; uses the metaphor of a Royal Wedding to bring to fore perhaps the most important and pertinent issue for us today - whether we are Christians or not ... and that is the rapture. There is nothing haphazard about the things we are witnessing and there is always a latent faith perspective to the headlines." />
