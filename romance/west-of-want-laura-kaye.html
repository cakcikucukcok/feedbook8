When Zeph&#39;s heartbreak whips up a storm that shipwrecks a human, his guilt forces him to save her.Ella is drawn to the vulnerability Zeph hides beneath his otherworldly masculinity and ancient blue eyes. And her honesty, empathy, and unique, calming influence leave Zeph wanting...everything. When Eurus threatens Ella, she and Zeph struggle to let go of the past, defend their future, and embrace what they most want--a love that can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Hearts of the Anemoi series is STANDALONE: &lt;br&gt;* North of Need&lt;br&gt;* West of Want&lt;br&gt;* South of Surrender&lt;br&gt;* East of Ecstasy&lt;/p&gt;" />
