  <title>Development in Unity Volume One - Daasebre Prof. Oti Boateng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Development in Unity: A Compendium of Works of Daasebre Prof. (Emeritus) Oti Boateng, Volume1 is a compilation of research works, published articles, speeches, seminar presentations, addresses, and radio broadcasts written by the author over the past 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these articles, the author, a distinguished statistician, a university don, a UN commissioner, a Vice-Chancellor of the World Academy of Letters, and a traditional ruler, combines his rich scholarly background and his deep understanding of complex traditional, national and international issues in addressing some challenges that face humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into nine sub-themes, namely, 1) Education, 2) Governance, 3) Statistics, 4) Population and Health, 5) Natural Disasters, 6) Oil and Gas, 7) Chieftaincy and Culture, 8) Religion, and 9) Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this book, Development in Unity, is derived from the mission of the Akwantukese Festival, which is, Development in Unity for the Welfare of the People.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Akwantukese Festival, was instituted in 1997 by the Omanhene, Chiefs, and People of New Juaben to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Daasebre Professor (Emeritus) Oti Boatengs enstoolment as Omanhene of New Juaben in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The Festival commemorates the migration of the Juabens and their allies from Asante to the Eastern Region of Ghana in the 1870s. The basic goal of Akwantukese is to promote the socio-economic progress of the people through education, traditions, and customs. It further serves as a tourist attraction for people all over the world. Akwantukese also reinforces the ancestral unity between the citizens of Asante and Jew Juaben for peaceful co-existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles in this first volume have been carefully selected to emphasize these ideals thereby creating a gift for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you enjoy these collections look out for the next volume in the series which is scheduled to come out very soon. &lt;/p&gt;" />
