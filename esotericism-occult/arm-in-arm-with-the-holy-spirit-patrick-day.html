  <title>Arm in Arm with the Holy Spirit - Patrick Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arm In Arm with the Holy Spirit&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is more than an engaging story; it is a theological narrative on the presence and leading of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer.&amp;nbsp; Those who are looking for a better understanding of what it means to be led by the Holy Spirit and hearing the voice of God will learn, along with the book&amp;#39;s main character Paul Chambers, to grow in the pursuit of a Holy Spirit directed life. &amp;nbsp;Through the many metaphors and practical applications found in this book, Christians will have a clearer idea of what the Apostle Paul was talking about when he instructed us to &amp;quot;keep in step with the Spirit.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; (Galatians 5:25)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Paul is a very believable character that people will be able to identify with. He asks God questions that all of us have in our own spiritual journey, and he is willing to wait on God for a response to his questions. This book shows there is a reward for waiting on the Lord for answers no matter how long it takes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Reading this book will draw you closer to God as you experience, through the main character Paul Chambers, the role of the Holy Spirit in your life. Understanding your own part in this walk of faith is even more helpful.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Arm in Arm with the Holy Spirit&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a simple story, not encumbered with lots of doctrinal detail;yet the clear, crisp language and evocative metaphors give it power and depth.The metaphors are expressed well and memorable. The importance of our&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;choices&amp;nbsp;to open or close the gates of our souls speaks volumes about the relationship between spirit and soul. In summary, the book is both simple and profound, a rare combination in literature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
