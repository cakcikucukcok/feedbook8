  <title>Liberty and Justice for Some - Ted Paulk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The news story runs repeatedly: A teenage girl is raped and murdered by a recently paroled child molester Marcus Regan. While searching for her body, the police find the remains of another victim, killed a year earlier by the same man. Through the machinations of his attorney, Regan cuts a deal for a life sentence rather than facing the death penalty.
The story infuriates former police officer Josh OBrien. He decides its time to introduce a more fitting punishment to child predators living behind prison walls. His first attempt fails when he is assaulted by gang members he tries to recruit in South Phoenix. Joshs fervor reignites when the father of a murdered woman in a high-profile case takes his revenge on her killer. OBrien calls on an imprisoned pal from Texas, Bobby Lee Baker, and they target Regan.
Jacob Oakley, a noted attorney with high ethical standards, sees Bobby Lees plight and gets involved. With the help of his private investigator and a female deputy, Oakley uncovers a plot involving a crooked sheriff, an unscrupulous federal agent, and numerous unsavory lawyers, judges, and prosecutors who have wrongfully put a large number of minor offenders in prison for life." />
