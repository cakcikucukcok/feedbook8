Essential techniques covered include spindle turning, duplication, reeding, fluting and spiral turning. In addition you&amp;#39;ll learn:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ins and outs of lathe operation, maintenance and safety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which tools you should invest in and which ones you can take a pass on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper tool sharpening and honing procedures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woodturning techniques such as creating beads, coves, urns and vases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to turn duplicates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Previously published as &amp;quot;Woodturning for Cabinetmakers,&amp;quot; this reissue of a woodworking classic gives you the skills you need to turn your back on inferior factory-made components and turn your own parts that you can be proud of.&lt;/div&gt;" />
