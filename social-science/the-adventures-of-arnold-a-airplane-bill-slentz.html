  <title>The Adventures of Arnold A. Airplane - Bill Slentz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series featuring the adventures of Arnold A. Airplane. It was inspired by the birth of my grandson Jace.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of taking care of Jace for about three hours one day. The last thirty minutes or so, he was asleep in my arms. As I was holding him and just looking down into his little face, my heart filled with a love I had not felt in many years. I then tried to analyze why I love him so much, since he wasn&#39;t doing anything. He was just there! So I just drank in the moments, wishing that feeling of pure love would last forever.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I then thought about God&#39;s relationship with me. I have always thought I needed to perform, to be doing something for Him to make sure He will love me. But, as impossible as it seems, He loves me even more than I love Jace, and when He looks at me, His heart fills with love too. I don&#39;t need to give Him a reason to love me; He just does! All I need do is desire to be near Him.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, my Father , for showing me You love me in the same way I love Jace and for sending Your Son to die for me so that I may experience your perfect love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
