  <title>An Avon True Romance: Amelia and the Outlaw - Lorraine Heath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amelia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a strict, eagle-eyed judge for a father and two older brothers to back him up, Amelia Harper is doted upon and protected within an inch of her life. She&#39;s not even allowed to have a sweetheart until she&#39;s seventeen, for example. Amelia longs for the day she can do as she pleases, but that day doesn&#39;t seem to be in any hurry to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Outlaw&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a young fellow, Jesse Lawton has a surprisingly shady background. The only wonder is that it took him until the age of fourteen to end up in jail, so wild was the path he&#39;d been on. But five years have passed, and his luck finally seems to have turned: he&#39;s been freed. If only he can stay on the straight and narrow . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jesse arrives at the Harper ranch to work off the remainder of his sentence, it&#39;s no surprise that the judge&#39;s pretty daughter catches his eye. What he doesn&#39;t know is that this young lady is itching for excitement, and with one look into his haunted eyes, Amelia knows she&#39;s found it in Jesse. Without meaning to, Amelia forces the erstwhile outlaw into a choice between his freedom and his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
