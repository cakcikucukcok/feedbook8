  <title>Fools in Uniform - Jibrin Idris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Danladi did not plan to become a drug courier, but when the opportunity came through Dorothy, he took it. Dorothy was a drug pusher and a lesbian. Danladi saw her as God sent, the kind of girl he would have loved, but there was Betty, her lover and a chronic drug addict. He would have been glad working as construction laborer if she hadnt suggested he meet Henry Okafar, a vicious drug baron who dines with government agents. There would be money coming to him if he agrees to haul drugs overseas. But the drug business is high risk. More blood had been split on drug war than most wars and millions of naira spent, but the war is continuing. Maula was a great medicine man from Hausa land. With some airport staffs and government agents colliding with Henry, Maulas talisman was seeing as an enigma. The streets of Green Town were worse hit, youth graduated from sniffing cocaine to inhaling certain solvents with hallucinogenic effect, resulting in serious physical damage and numbers of deaths. 
Things would have stayed that way if a foreign diplomat hadnt made a scanty comment. It was the beginning of problems for NDLEA and the police." />
