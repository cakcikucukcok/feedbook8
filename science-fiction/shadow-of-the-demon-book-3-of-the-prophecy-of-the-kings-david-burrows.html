      <meta name="description" content="The threat from Trosgarth is growing and betrayal is in the air. The Priests of Ryoch,  no longer a minor faction, are trained warriors with empathic powers. Armies are marching to war and the balance is no longer in the favour of the allies, for without the Eldric and their sorcery they cannot hope to win. Desperate to redress the balance a new power will be sought, but this will not be all that it seems.   Kaplyn&#39;s nightmares are plagued by dragons and his fear of them has driven him from Thrace, seeking the truth behind an image, shown to him by Astalus the Court Wizard. Kaplyn is shown an image that Vastra is alive. If that is to be believed then the enemy now has a crystal from the tree of life and will be able to open a permanent gateway between the worlds, allowing the demon hoards to come, and no one will be able to oppose them.   Kaplyn is driven to the very brink of despair, having touched a kara-stone he has awoken the link with his Shaol and madness threatens his fragile hold on reality...." />
