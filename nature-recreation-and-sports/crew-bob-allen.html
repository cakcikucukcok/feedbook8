  <title>Crew - Bob Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every man&#39;s dream - to sail around the world. This is the story of one man who did it, sailing as crew on a number of boats. His adventures, misadventures, and insights into exotic cultures and the diverse personalities he meets along the way make for a fascinating read. During his 32,000 mile trip, he survived a collision, two groundings, numerous storms, and one obsessive compulsive captain. Despite the hardships, this book is a celebration of the diversity of our planet and its people. The author succeeds brilliantly in sharing his fascination with the ocean and its creatures, from a manta ray he encountered while diving on the Great Barrier Reef to the school of dolphins numbering in the hundreds in the South Pacific. His insights into the exotic cultures he encounters along the way are equally fascinating; a visit with the Kuna Indians of Panama, a feast in Tonga, tours of Buddhist Temples in Sri Lanka, and the magical majesty of Rhodes. An epic adventure that will leave the reader with a sense of wonder." />
