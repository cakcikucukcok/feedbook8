  <title>G. W. - Eddie Lunsford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Can you tell me about the most interesting, wonderful person you ever knew?&quot;  Most of us could answer this question with little hesitation.  The person you have in mind may be famous or obscure, male or female, living or dead.  She could be the neighbor who was kind to you as a child, she could be your wife or your grandmother.  He could be an old friend from college, a fishing buddy or business acquaintance.  Whoever the person is, they are special and you wish other people could know them.
In this book, I introduce my special person to the world.  He was my grandfather.  His name was G.W. Lunsford.  He was born in the Southern Appalachian Mountains over one hundred years ago.  He raised his family, worked hard and did the best he could.  He endured heartbreak that would be psychologically lethal to the average person.  He smiled and found good in every person he knew.  This book is a mirror of his life.  It is an unusual and fascinating blend of fact, folklore and fiction.  It is a history book, a text in sociology and a biography.  The story is straightforward. Lessons about life are hidden within the pages." />
