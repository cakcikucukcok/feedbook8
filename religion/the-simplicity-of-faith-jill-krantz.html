  <title>The Simplicity of Faith - Jill Krantz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a pastor and leader of a local church, Jill Krantzs  The Simplicity of Faith is a breath of fresh air in relaying the simple and effective tenants of salvation and faith in Jesus. Comprehensive and enlightening, this book offers both a snapshot of the Gospel, as well as an in-depth glance into what seems at times as to be the muddy waters of faith. Krantz is able to simplify and personalize the vast pages of doctrine and religion into an entertaining, and informative journey that reveals the true purpose of Jesus sacrifice: a personal walk with Him in liberty and peace. Every pastor should have a copy of this book for new Christians and troubled believers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Richie Moore Youth and Childrens Minister at Evangel Temple Southwest, Middleburg, FL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If brevity is the soul of wit, then simplicity is the soul of design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Ms. Krantz utilizes the concept of simplicity to get at the nature of human thought and perception, while also drawing out tangible applications for the faith-driven life of a Christ Follower. The Simplicity Of Faith is thoroughly optimistic, entertaining, and erudite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it approachable and usable, and I firmly believe that it will keep readers thumbing back for a second and third look at her deceptively simple advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its quite evident that Jill is a very humble, enlightened, and caring human. I happily recommend this book to all, from senior-saints to new believers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respectfully, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Collins &lt;/p&gt;
