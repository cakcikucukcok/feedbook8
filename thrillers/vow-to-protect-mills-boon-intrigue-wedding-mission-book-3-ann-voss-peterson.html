          &lt;strong&gt;BLACK TIE REQUIRED&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The wedding invitation sent to Cordell Turner had looked innocent enough. But the person who had sent it, notorious serial killer Dryden Kane, was anything but. With the calculating murderer on the loose, Cord was headed for a most unexpected family reunion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Melanie Frist never imagined she&#39;d see Cord&#39;s icy blues ever again. But after she was targeted by a killer, Cord reappeared on her doorstep expecting to find only one life at stake. Instead he found one more than he bargained for. Would Cord be able to keep his newfound family safe from harm, or would the joyful reunion end in tears?&lt;/p&gt;
