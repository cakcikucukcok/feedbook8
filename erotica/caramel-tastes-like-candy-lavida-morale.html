  <title>Caramel Tastes Like Candy - Lavida Morale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Carmelia Ortegas tumultuous and marriage fell apart, she was crushed and lost. She tried to find the strength to rebuild her life, but that was too much for her. In one awful day, she lost her husband and her home; now shes forced to sell herself on the streets to survive. She moves in with her gay brother, Amelio, and decides to make a living running a one-person escort service. All she has going for herself is a need to satisfy her clients and some meager savings. 
She becomes a pawn in the many detailed erotic fantasies and tastes of her clients. Everything seems to be going her way until her beloved brother finds himself in the middle of a sexual harassment scandal. In the midst of that stressful time, she meets Michael, a man who seems to want her for more than just her body. Her heart isnt the only thing swelling and yearning for his touch, and she finds it harder and harder to get excited about her work. Michaels love thrills her more than the money shes losing, and she allows herself to fall under his seductive spell. 
Carmelia does her best to satisfy the many lusty appetites of all the men in her lifeeven as she learns the painful lesson that some people are not as nice as they seemin this urban erotic adventure." />
