  <title>Beep - David Wanczyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Beep,&lt;/em&gt; David Wanczyk illuminates the sport of blind baseball to show us a remarkable version of America&amp;#8217;s pastime. With balls tricked out to squeal three times per second, and with bases that buzz, this game of baseball for the blind is both innovative and intense. And when the best beep baseball team in America, the Austin Blackhawks, takes on its international rival, Taiwan Homerun, no one&amp;#8217;s thinking about disability. What we find are athletes playing their hearts out for a championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Wanczyk follows teams around the world and even joins them on the field to produce a riveting inside narrative about the game and its players. Can Ethan Johnston, kidnapped and intentionally blinded as a child in Ethiopia, find a new home in beep baseball, and a spot on the all-star team? Will Taiwan&amp;#8217;s rookie MVP Ching-kai Chen&amp;#8212;whose superhuman feats on the field have left some veterans suspicious&amp;#8212;keep up his incredible play? And can Austin&amp;#8217;s Lupe Perez harness his competitive fire and lead his team to a long-awaited victory in the beep baseball world series?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Beep&lt;/em&gt; is the first book about blind baseball.
