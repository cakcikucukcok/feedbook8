  <title>United States Air Force Academy Class of ‘74 - Bill Van Horn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine flying into Iran to rescue the American embassy employees being held hostage. What would it be like to be a pilot of a military refueling aircraft, loaded with jet fuel and passengers, accelerating to takeoff speed, then having to do a high-speed abort because of an aircraft malfunction. Put yourself in an aircraft that crashes onto a remote airstrip during a blizzard. How would you react to being a young man who has it all, being a military pilot and newly married, but you learn that you have leukemia. You are then told about a new medical procedure called a bone marrow transplant but, half the people who have tried that have died. What would it be like to be a member of the United States military, training to defend your nation against the Soviet Empire during the Cold War, when your government tells you that you are going on a mission to establish Christian organizations in the Soviet military. These are all real-world stories from graduates of the Class of 74 of the United States Air Force Academy. Read, laugh, cry, learn and be inspired." />
