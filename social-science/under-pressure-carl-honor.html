  <title>Under Pressure - Carl Honoré</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why do grown-ups have to take over everything?&quot; This innocent question from acclaimed journalist and international bestselling author Carl Honor&amp;#233;&amp;#8217;s son sparked a two-year investigation into how our culture of speed, efficiency, and success at all costs is damaging both parents and children. When the impulse to give children the best of everything runs rampant, parents, schools, communities, and corporations unwittingly combine forces to create over-scheduled, over-stimulated, and overindulged kids. The mere mention of potty-training, ballet classes, preschool, ADD, or overeating is enough to spark a heated debate about the right way to raise our children. The problem is that despite the best intentions of all involved, the pressure to manage every detail of our children&amp;#8217;s lives from in utero through college is overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering much more than a wake-up call, international bestselling author Carl Honor&amp;#233; interviews experts in Europe, North America, and the Far East, talks to families around the world and sifts through the latest scientific research. Not only do we see the real dangers of micromanaging children, but Honor&amp;#233; also shows us an emerging new movement inspiring many to slow down and find the natural balance between too little and too much. Blending the finest reportage, intellectual inquiry, and extraordinary true stories, &lt;em&gt;Under Pressure&lt;/em&gt; is the first book to challenge the status quo by mapping out an alternative to the culture of hyperparenting that is presently pushing children and their parents to the brink.&lt;/p&gt;" />
