  <title>Inner Sanctum - Don Erdek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Things abruptly changed when the 1963 economic recession set in. The work-study position with Franklin Institute fell through and he instead took a position with Bell Telephone Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and changed his career direction to engineering and making money. He continued with an education and did graduate study at Brooklyn Institute of Technology. Abruptly, his career objectives turned to travel and to see the world. He moved to Miami, Florida, and, shortly thereafter, took a job on Eniwetok Atoll in the South Pacific followed by one in Tripoli, Libya, then one in Saudi Arabia that lasted some eighteen years. He retired in May 1991 at the age of fifty-six. But later as a lark took another position with Johnson Controls at Cape Canaveral just because the position was a challenge to work at the Cape and on the space programs launch towers.
Returned to Texas in 1996 and he bought a seventy-three-acre ranch in Colmesneil in the deep east Texas piney woods.
Was a rancher of seventeen years on one of the most beautiful pieces of Gods green Earth. Today he decided it was time to write a book." />
