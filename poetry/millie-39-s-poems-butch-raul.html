  <title>Millie&#39;s Poems - Butch Raul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My poems came to me by the Lord putting the words in my heart about special friends and things in my life. It is made of poems that I have written over the years. My first poem, &quot;A Lonely Fool,&quot; was made from being at my mom&#39;s and being downhearted. I wrote it out and gave it to her. 
Years down the road, I realized I had a lot of poems, so I put them all together, and this poem book was made. 
I want to dedicate this book to my special friends: to Kevin R, for his help to do this book; to Nikki and Mona Bowles, Sharon Bowers, and Sue Ratliff; and to Jodi M, for her help." />
