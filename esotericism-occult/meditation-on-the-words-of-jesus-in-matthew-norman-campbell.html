  <title>Meditation on the Words of Jesus in Matthew - Norman Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am the treasurer of Saint Anne and all Saints, Vauxhall, and have qualified for The Diocesan Certificate in Biblical and Theological Studies. My intention here is to outline what the words of Jesus evoke in me as an ordinary Christian. Having prayed before the task that was in front of me I hope I have some inspiring comments to make that will be instructive to fellow Christians and even unbelievers. The following verse of a favourite hymn, popular with many, hopefully may be applicable during the process of reading this book as Jesus is very much alive and present in my life generally.
I heard the voice of Jesus say:
&#39;Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, Thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon my breast.&#39;
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad,
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.
I hope my comments will result in a closer relationship of the reader with Jesus, and that the end result will be peace and hope for the future as Christians." />
