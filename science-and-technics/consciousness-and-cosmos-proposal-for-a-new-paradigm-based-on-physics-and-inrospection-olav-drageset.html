  <title>Consciousness and Cosmos: Proposal for a New Paradigm Based on Physics and Inrospection - Olav Drageset</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your memories and feelings could be stored in matter based on non-physical atoms.  This book takes the unique approach of recognizing that mental and spiritual phenomena can be observed in the same way that scientists observe physical phenomena. The book shows how all phenomena can be explained by string theory developed by physicists. First, the mind is described in accordance with modern psychology and introspection. String theory is then interpreted in a way that incorporates the mind and consciousness into the cosmos.  &quot;Consciousness and Cosmos&quot; provides many new and exciting perspectives that will be appreciated by readers of all backgrounds. A deeper introduction to modern physics, cosmology and the scientific approach is also provided for added interest. The book builds on established knowledge, but enables spirituality to become part of mainstream science and shows how matter and spirit can be reconciled. It provides new perspectives about existing knowledge for professionals in fields such as physics, psychology, neurology and biology. Reviews and downloads can be found at amatterofmind.net" />
