  <title>The Reluctant Spy - John H. Goodwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reluctant Spy: Revolution is the first half of the timely story of Calvin Evan, a smart but flawed CIA agent, beginning with the 1979 Iranian revolution. Cal develops a critical Iranian operative and becomes embroiled in the audacious yet little honored effort to liberate the American embassy hostages. Romantically, hes caught between his love for a rescued refugee and the aggressive intentions of his bosss manipulative daughter. Ensnaring him, the savvy daughter navigates his career away from the political fallout of the missions failure and directs him to the battleground of the 1980s, the Nicaraguan Contra War, where Cal runs an illegal funding operation. Morally conflicted and victimized by his erratic behavior, he slips into a burned-out funk, posted to Switzerland. There, amidst the rise of Middle Eastern terrorism, his past pulls him into conflict with his former Iranian asset, possibly a double agent, and reunites him with his long ago betrayed love, now a death squad target." />
