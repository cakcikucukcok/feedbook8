  <title>My Diploma Doesn&#39;t Seem to Work: Principles they forgot to teach in High School - MoisÃ©s Castillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;My Diploma doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work&amp;quot; was written by a recent high school grad who is passionate about helping others see through an established system and find their greater potential. What you will get out of reading this book is a shifted perspective and an abundance of self-awareness of the systematic structure that every student is obligated to go through. Whether the student becomes successful outside of school, comes down to how well they are self-aware of their surroundings and environment. Concepts that the educational curriculum leaves out will be addressed in the book through a series of vignettes and analysis along with recommendations for further knowledge. High school education is a subject that should no longer be looked over, by rather understanding there is a hole in the system. And the first step in solving a problem is realizing there is a problem." />
