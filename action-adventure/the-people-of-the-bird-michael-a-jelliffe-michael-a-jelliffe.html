      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two generations, two cultures, a shared history, an uncertain future, and one bird... &lt;em&gt;nenge.&lt;/em&gt; An isolated community races against time to meet the challenges of a mining venture being thrust upon it.&amp;nbsp;Guided by the stories of their ancestors, the leaders discover how a small Bird of Paradise guides two generations and inspires them to some surprising conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This contemporary&amp;nbsp;novel, set in modern day Papua New Guinea, follows the leaders of a remote community as they face political intrigue and make tough decisions in the advance of an exploration and mining venture in their area. Huge areas of land and many species of flora and fauna in Papua New Guinea have been lost in recent decades by the indiscriminate environmental destruction caused by mining and logging operations. The land, the way of life and its value as heritage, is being lost. This novel is not only a modern adventure story, it has a strong conservationist theme and seeks to challenge readers to consider their response to the use of their land and its resources.&lt;/p&gt;" />
