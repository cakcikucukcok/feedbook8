      <meta name="description" content="False Awakening: A convincing dream about awakening from sleep, when in reality you are still asleep. Wake up! What is the most sinister world you can imagine, the worst of all possible worlds? It&#39;s the one where all of the people are endarkened but believe themselves enlightened. None of them wants to change because they think they are perfect. They exist forever in this benighted condition, doing nothing to discover the Truth of reality, to find the answers to existence, to see the real light rather than the fake light. Our world is full of the fake enlightened, the phony awakened, the fraudulent &quot;lightworkers&quot;. The so-called light they perceive is &quot;darkness visible&quot;, i.e. Satanic light, the light of hell. Nothing is more dangerous than a false awakening. The world is full of legions of the falsely awakened, of endarkened zombies. They are still asleep, still inside the cave, and merely dreaming that they have seen the light. Wake up!" />
