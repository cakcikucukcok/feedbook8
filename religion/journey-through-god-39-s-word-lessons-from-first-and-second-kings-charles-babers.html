  <title>Journey Through God&#39;s Word - Lessons from First and Second Kings - Charles Babers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Journey Through God&#39;s Word&quot; is a versatile and easy to use system for teaching children the Word of God.  More than just a set of lessons, it is a comprehensive curriculum that provides every resource that you might need to be a successful Bible teacher.  The various elements of the curriculum are designed to support all the different ways that children learn and all the different methods and techniques that teachers use to teach.  It tells you WHAT to teach, but not HOW to teach it, leaving you free to use your individual imagination and creativity to make each lesson your own.  We&#39;ve done all the hard work to make sure that you have all that you need.  The only things missing are the students...and YOU! Lessons from 1st &amp; 2nd Kings contains 26 lessons, and includes stories such as the Wisdom of King Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, the Division of the Kingdom, the Kings of Israel and Judah, Elijah and the Prophets of Baal, Elijah&#39;s Chariot of Fire, Elisha and Naaman, and the Boy Kings Josiah and Joash." />
