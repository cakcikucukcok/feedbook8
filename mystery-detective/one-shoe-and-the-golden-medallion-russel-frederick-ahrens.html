  <title>One Shoe and the Golden Medallion - Russel Frederick Ahrens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Terror strikes the world as a series of identical murders rock the globe. In each case, two people are involved. The first victim is found murdered with a bloodless hole puncturing a tattoo image of an ancient sandal. The second
victim ends up missing, with nothing but a single shoe left behind. Obviously, authorities are stumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to altruistic billionaire Henry Wainwright, who wishes to use his
wealth and knowledge to improve the world. To  do so, he has deployed an army of divinely  possessed Virtue Warriors. He has founded  the Society for Human Virtues, intended to erase the world of ignorance and self-  destruction, one dead body at a time. But what really happens to each victim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the center of this mess is Frenchman Maury Levet, employed by Wainwright for purposes as yet unknown. As time passes,  Levets suspicions increase. He notices Wainwright wears a golden medallion, and  something about the piece of jewelry makes Levet uncomfortable. He doesnt trust Wainwrightwhich is why he is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Wainwright goes missing, however, Levet experiences a supernatural transformation that brings great power. Now, Levet might fulfi ll the ultimate destiny of Wainwrights Society  or he might disappear, too, leaving nothing behind but a shoe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
