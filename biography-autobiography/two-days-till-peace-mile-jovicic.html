  <title>Two Days Till Peace - Mile Jovicic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating and gripping survival story. The book describes what it was like to live day by day in a city undergoing the beginnings of a terrible civil war where one did not know what was going on from one minute to the next and there was danger at every corner. Neighbors, old friends and colleagues suddenly became enemies and whether you liked it or not you were forced to take sides. The author tells his story with suspense and honesty. He did a remarkable job in keeping the Sarajevo Airport operational against all odds and in doing so was able to help thousands of Sarajevans flee the horrors that quickly overcame the city. A truly fine read.&lt;br/&gt;
James Bissett, former Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the early UN commander in Sarajevo it would have helped a lot if I knew some of the details Mile recounts herein; unfortunately, he was a kilometer away, which during the war was a mighty long and dangerous trip.&lt;br/&gt;
Lewis Mackenzie, Canadian Major General (Retd)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary testimony about the early days of the war in Bosnia from a witness at the very heart of events. Jovicics compelling account sheds light on the chaotic situation in mid-1992 and the many missed opportunities to avoid the bloodshed that ensued.&lt;br/&gt;
Nebojsa Malic, columnist, Antiwar.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great story, breathtaking! At the Sarajevo Airport the events could have easily spun out of control. The author faithfully recorded many aspects of unreported history that forces us to rethink what really happened in Bosnia.&lt;br/&gt;
Kent Johnson, US Air Force Colonel (Retd)&lt;/p&gt;" />
