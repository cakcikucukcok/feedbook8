David Vancil is not just a bartender but an Alchemist who puts the true meaning of 
&quot;Spirits&quot; in every drink! 
-J.D. Amoro Estrill -Artist 
&quot;I&#39;ve never experienced bar service at the level of David Vancil&#39;s-he is THE BEST. There is a reason he is called The Sensei! When he is behind the bar, it&quot;s like a magician with his cape on. You don&#39;t even see his hands moving then abracadabra you&#39;ve got a drink in your hand. And it&#39;s either your favorite drink, or your new favorite drink! That&#39;s how he works. And he brings this level of service and integrity each and every night. I would take anything David says straight to the bank when it comes to the history of bar service, or the modernization of it. &quot;-Benjamin Yiapan-Fitness Consultant" />
