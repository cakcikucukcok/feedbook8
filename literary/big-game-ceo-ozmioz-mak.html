  <title>Big Game Ceo - Ozmioz Mak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joe  says, I just had a brainstorm. This spring the theme for my Literature of the Western World Class will be What does it mean to be a man in the modern world?&lt;/p&gt;
Danny readies his IceMan compound bow and yells, Pull! Bobby launches a clay pigeon The clay pigeon ricochets to the left and the arrow downward. It is not like shooting a clay pigeon with a shotgun where the clay pigeon breaks into a hundred pieces but everyone there understands this is a thousand times more impresses.&lt;/p&gt;
He tries using some of Uncle Archies arguments like that the entire purpose of the government, taxes, and the judicial system is to let the weak survive in the world through game playing, networking, and conniving. The girls laugh with each other as they win handily. Bobby raises his voice as he goes down in flames. Danny sits there with a blank expression on his face. Howie just laughs to himself. &lt;/p&gt;
Dominique  addresses the dining hall, Even though Ayn Rand was a woman, most analyze her writings and philosophy from a mans point of view. Tonight I want to analyze Ayn Rand from a womans point of view&lt;/p&gt;
Uncle Joe startles Howie when he asks, Money, power, glory, and war equals women. Interesting thesis. But reading between the lines of your thesis you believe that manhood is defined by taking these pursuits to an extreme, dont you?&lt;/p&gt;
Howie says,  love stories are often complicated. That is because motherhood is the second oldest profession. We all hate to admit this but before our descendents were mothers they were all good whores just like Hester Prynne.&lt;/p&gt;
 are you thinking of going on a African Safari?&lt;/p&gt;
Why not? It would be manlier than hunting deer and turkey in Pennsylvania. Look at George Eastman. He lived a hundred years ago, he was gay, and hell be manlier than well ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
Dominique is standing directly behind Catherine. Howie is on stage directly in front of them. He looks down. Dominique points and lips, Is this Catherine Halsey? Catherine turns her head and looks at Dominique for the first time." />
