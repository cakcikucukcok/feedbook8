  <title>Purely Business - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Allie knows something is wrong when she is suddenly standing in front of a crowd of strangers and finds herself overcame with the urge to start undressing. She knows she&amp;#39;s in serious trouble when her hands start moving and she does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The door swung inward, and we stood face to face, neither moving for the longest time. The man standing by the door was good looking to a fault. I had to remind myself to breathe, taking in a shuddering breath when I finally managed to get through to my lungs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, his face split into a grin that made me shiver a little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is a lovely surprise,&amp;quot; he said quietly, eyeing me up and down. I was wearing a red mini dress with off shoulder straps and a sweetheart neckline, barely containing my heavy breasts. The belt around my waist was frilled and cinched tight and below the hem of my dress, my legs were bare. I was wearing heels that were too high to be comfortable. As his eyes travelled back up my legs, he paused at the belt around my waist and reached over to pull me in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dragged my gaze up and saw his smile. He looked like he just won first prize in some sort of competition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How so?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re absolutely stunning,&amp;quot; he breathed, pulling me by my belt to him. I pressed my palms to his chest and smiled in what I hoped was a sly, leering manner. My heart was trying it&amp;#39;s best not to jump right out of my ribcage in shock. He was too close, as close as a man had ever been to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t look too bad yourself,&amp;quot; I said and it was true. He was good looking in all the right ways. An image of him lifting heavy weights, muscles bulging, came to my mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dipped his head down, looking for a kiss, and I had enough brain cells left in my mind to put my hand between our faces. His face was so, so close and his lips were incredibly kissable. I wondered if they would feel as soft as they looked. I gulped frantically before I came to the realization that I should use my words instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wait,&amp;quot; I whispered in a soft, breathy voice. &amp;quot;I thought I was here to work?&amp;quot; I asked. As tempting as it was to do other things with this handsome man, I needed the money. We talked briefly over the phone, agreeing on the payment, if he chose to hire me, but I still wasn&amp;#39;t completely sure what I was here for. Maybe he wanted my kidneys. I happened to be quite happy to have both kidneys in my body, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, you are,&amp;quot; he replied coolly but released me. &amp;quot;The only rules here are what you have and if I recall correctly, you said no rules.&amp;quot;" />
