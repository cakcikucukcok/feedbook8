  <title>Escaped from the Nations - Alexandra Glynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pre-civilization, the Egyptian Empire, the Hittite Empire, the Phoenician Empire, the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire--all of these civilizations enter into the pages of the Bible. These six stories, written as if they happened in each of these civilizations, explore the faith and happenings of the Bible and seek to bring them into familiarity. How did the hearts of men operate thousands of years ago? What were the central images and parables used to proclaim truths about the invisible divine? What was the arc of the history of the waiting for the day of redemption like? Jesus said that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, but the prophet was sent as a missionary to a Gentile, and not a widow of Israel. The many missions to the Gentiles in the Old Testament times are the central theme of this book. &quot;And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory&quot; (Isaiah 66:19)." />
