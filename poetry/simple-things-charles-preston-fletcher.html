  <title>Simple Things - Charles Preston Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of simple poetry is a pleasant journey of deeper self-awareness, and gratitude, on the road to self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a little more of how to find and fully appreciate the joy and fun in life as the topics of love, gratitude, hope and inspiration are more deeply explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God gives us strength through the struggle between good and evil. In this struggle is where the best in life is found. The more we look the more we begin to clearly see that the joys in life abound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are lucky, God lets us all start out our lives with a strong sense of curiosity, while knowing that we are loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the best in life by strengthening three aspects of our faith. The strength of our faith in God, the strength of our faith in others and the strength of our faith in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both our love and our faith are strengthened by never giving up. At some point in our lives, many of us come to realize that it is the strength we find in the selfless love of Jesus Christ that is all thats held us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest value in the Christian life is the gift of eternal life!&lt;br&gt;
The second greatest value in the Christian life is in the living of it!&lt;br&gt;
Curtis H. West, M.L.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of self-discovery can be frightening, exhilarating, confusing, liberating, and often best undertaken accompanied by a caring voice. Charles Prestons poetry shiningly serves as such a voice for all who wish to begin a journey of their own.&lt;br&gt;
