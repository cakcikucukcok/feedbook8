  <title>The Chase - Brenda Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Claire Hayden has no idea that her world is about to be shattered.  At the conclusion of her husband&#39;&#39; 40th birthday party, he is found murdered, his throat cut with a weapon that hasn&#39;t been used since World War II.  He has no enemies.  He has committed no crimes. He has no shady past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claire&#39;s search for information leads her to the mysterious Ian Marshall, an acquaintance of her husband who seems to know something.  Someone has been killing this way for decade.  Someone whose crimes go back to World War II.  Someone who will do anything to make sure no one finds out.  As Claire and Ian team up to track down the killer, Ian makes a shocking revelation: the killer may be close-and moving closer-to Claire.  Full of twists and turns, The Chase is a fast-paced thriller with Brenda Joyce&#39;s trademark plotting, sensuality, and characterization.&lt;/p&gt;" />
