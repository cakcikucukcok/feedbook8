  <title>Stolen: Escape from Syria - Louise Monaghan, Yvonne Kinsella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the vein of &lt;i&gt;Not Without My Daughter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Stolen: Escape from Syria &lt;/i&gt;is a memoir recounting a mother&#39;s crusade to rescue her kidnapped daughter from her abusive ex-husband during the tumultuous days of the Arab Spring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the middle of one of the worst civil wars in Syria&#39;s history, Louise Monaghan walked across a heavily guarded border to save her six-year-old child from the father who had callously snatched her from her home in Cyprus. Fearing for her daughter&#39;s future under the oppressive Sharia law, the Irish mother returned to her ex-husband, Mostafa Assad, to bide her time until she could escape with her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in his homeland, she too was held captive, locked inside a run-down house with little food and no hope of deliverance. Severely beaten by Mostafa --she was even left unconscious on the ground in front of their child--she and her little girl miraculously escaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suspenseful account will pull at your heartstrings, enveloping you in harrowing events that no mother would dare imagine and culminating with the triumphal feats this mother achieved. Smuggled across a heavily patrolled mountain range in the dead of night through bomb attacks and sniper fire, Monaghan and her daughter speak to the transcendent bond between mother and child.&lt;/p&gt;" />
