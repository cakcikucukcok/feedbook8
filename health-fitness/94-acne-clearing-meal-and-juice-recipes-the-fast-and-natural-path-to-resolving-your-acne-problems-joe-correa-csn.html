  <title>94 Acne Clearing Meal and Juice Recipes: The Fast and Natural Path to Resolving Your Acne Problems - Joe Correa CSN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Healthy and nutritional diets are a universal cure and the true prevention of acne. For example, some foods increase blood sugar, that in turn releases a hormone called insulin. This hormone is responsible for the increase of oil production in our skin which causes those terrible bumps on the skin. But, by maintaining a healthy diet, you can keep your blood sugar in balance and prevent high oil production on your skin.  I have created this book with acne-specific recipes based on healthy ingredients that are proven antioxidants, high in omega 3 fatty acids, and full of healthy fruits and vegetables in lots of different combinations.  Acne is often treated with drugs and cosmetic products making it a very profitable industry worldwide. However, these products often don&#39;t cure acne the way they should. They temporarily cure the visible part but don&#39;t create a significant affect on the cause of this condition.  Let these meal and juice recipes be your guide to getting rid of acne once and for all." />
