  <title>The Big Finish - James W. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A year ago Thorn&#39;s son, Flynn Moss, disappeared into the eco-underground, his only contact with Thorn a series of postcards chronicling his exploits. But a postcard arrives unlike the others, a call for help, Thorn jumps into action, setting off for North Carolina. But before Thorn arrives, he&#39;s intercepted by a federal agent who informs him he&#39;s too late--Flynn had been acting as an informant for the FBI, and when his traitorous acts were discovered, he was summarily executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent proposes a scheme to catch Flynn&#39;s killer using Thorn as bait. Thorn, full of rage, accepts the job if only to get his hands on his son&#39;s killer.  The mission takes him to a small town where the gang is holed up, planning an attack on a hog farming operation that has been polluting local rivers and spreading illness through the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little by little Thorn discovers that nothing he&#39;s been told is true, and the trap they&#39;re setting isn&#39;t for Flynn&#39;s killer, but for his partner, a woman who proves more daring and dangerous than any Thorn&#39;s ever met. She&#39;s on her own crusade of vengeance, and she and Thorn make an uneasy alliance. With her help Thorn uncovers a conspiracy that stretches far beyond this small Carolina town.&lt;/p&gt;" />
