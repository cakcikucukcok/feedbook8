  <title>Seven Sisters: Spiritual Messages from Aboriginal Australia - Laine Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER, CAROLINA WOMAN INSPIRATION AWARD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers who enjoy of &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/em&gt;, and Paul Coelho&amp;#39;s works will enjoy this unique blend of Aboriginal folktales paired with inspiring and incisive award-winning essays.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Laine Cunningham&amp;rsquo;s understanding of Aboriginal culture began during a six-month solo journey through the Australian Outback. The same visions that drew her into the red desert also told her that she would die there. A miraculous connection to divine energy saved her life and launched her along the path she follows to this day.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to Australia&amp;#39;s ancient cultures, all creatures and things emerged from the Dreamtime. The Dreaming is not just a collection of lore or a long-ago time; it is a living energy that flows constantly through the universe. It is then and now, divine and human, spirit and law. Because the energy is as vibrant today as ever, these ancient stories show us how to survive in a harsh world and how to thrive in our souls.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Each Aboriginal story in this collection is enhanced with an essay from award-winning author Laine Cunningham. Our modern perspectives on love and friendship, illness and joy, life and the afterlife can be enriched with this ancient knowledge. Open this book and take your own journey through the eternal Dreamtime. Along the way, you will discover that the ancient connection to god/goddess/the divine still resonates in your soul. You will discover your own truth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;em&gt;The Dance&lt;/em&gt;, readers are inspired to follow their dreams while staying balanced in their lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Trickery &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Seven Sisters&lt;/em&gt; address the special relationships between men and women.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;War&lt;/em&gt; provides a new perspective on one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most important issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Excerpts from this book have been published in spiritual, literary, and inspirational magazines and newsletters; one combination received an award.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Read today and discover your own truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
