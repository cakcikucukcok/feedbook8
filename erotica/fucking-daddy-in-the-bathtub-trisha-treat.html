  <title>Fucking Daddy in the Bathtub - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When 20 year old Alicia&#39;s Daddy took a fall at his construction job and broke his leg, she insisted that he come live with her until he is healed. Being the dutiful daughter that she is, she even helps him get washed up in the bathtub- but one night when Alicia decides to join him in the tub, Alicia and her Daddy both get more excited than they had anticipated. Their Daddy-Daughter relations will never be the same after what happens in the bath!
EXCERPT:
&quot;Hi, Daddy,&quot; I kissed him on the cheek. &quot;Let me put my things down and then I&#39;ll run the bath.&quot;
&quot;Take your time sweetheart.&quot; Daddy turned his attention back to the television. 
I quickly changed into a pair of yoga shorts and a tiny tank top, glad to finally be taking my bra off for the night. I headed to the bathroom and ran the hot water, then went out to help keep Daddy steady as he hobbled into the bathroom with his broken leg. I tried to drape his arm around me as we maneuvered down the hall to the bathroom, but Daddy was defiant. 
&quot;I&#39;m still an able-bodied man, Alicia. I can make it to the bathroom myself!&quot; He teasingly scolded me. 
&quot;Well then I guess you don&#39;t need my help in the bath?&quot; I retorted. He smacked my ass playfully as I skipped ahead of him down the hall.
&quot;Get your little ass back here and wash your Daddy! I might not need your help, but I sure want it!&quot;
I giggled at that. Daddy and I had always flirted with each other. I had always hoped that I could find myself a big, strong man like my dad. I ran off to grab a clean towel, and he went into the bathroom and undressed, carefully lowering himself into the water. I caught a glimpse of my hair in the mirror and realized I could use a bath myself." />
