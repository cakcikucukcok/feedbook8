  <title>The Essential Ginsberg - Allen Ginsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featuring the legendary and groundbreaking poem &amp;#8220;Howl,&amp;#8221; this remarkable volume showcases a selection of Allen Ginsberg&amp;#8217;s poems, songs, essays, letters, journals, and interviews and contains sixteen pages of his personal photographs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Beat Generation&amp;#8217;s most renowned poets and writers, Allen Ginsberg became internationally famous not only for his published works but for his actions as a human rights activist who championed the sexual revolution, human rights, gay liberation, Buddhism and eastern religion, and the confrontation of societal norms&amp;#8212;all before it became fashionable to do so. He was also the dynamic leader of war protesters, artists, Flower Power hippies, musicians, punks, and political radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Essential Ginsberg&lt;/em&gt; collects a mosaic of materials that displays the full range of Ginsberg&amp;#8217;s mental landscape. His most important poems, songs, essays, letters, journals, and interviews are displayed in chronological order. His poetic masterpieces, &amp;#8220;Howl&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Kaddish,&amp;#8221; are presented here along with lesser-known and difficult to find songs and prose. Personal correspondence with William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac is included as well as photographs&amp;#8212;shot and captioned by Ginsberg himself&amp;#8212;of his friends and fellow rogues William Burroughs, Neal Cassady, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his essays, journals, interviews, and letters, this definitive volume will inspire readers to delve deeper into a body of work that remains one of the most impressive literary canons in American history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
