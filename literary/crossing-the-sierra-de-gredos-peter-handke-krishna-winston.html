  <title>Crossing the Sierra de Gredos - Peter Handke, Krishna Winston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this visionary novel, Nobel Prize winner Peter Handke offers descriptions of objects, relationships, and events that teach readers a renewed way of seeing; he creates a wealth of images to replace those lost to convention and conformity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of a northwestern European river port city lives a powerful woman banker, a public figure admired and hated in equal measure, who has decided to turn from the worlds of high finance and modern life to embark on a quest. Having commissioned a famous writer to undertake her &quot;authentic&quot; biography, she journeys through the Spanish Sierra de Gredos and the region of La Mancha to meet him. As she travels by all-terrain vehicle, bus, and finally on foot, the nameless protagonist encounters five way stations that become the stuff of her biography and the biography of the modern world, a world in which genuine images and unmediated experiences have been exploited and falsified by commercialization and by the voracious mass media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crossing the Sierra de Gredos&lt;/i&gt; is a very human book of yearning and the ancient quest for love, peopled with memorable characters (from multiple historical periods) and imbued with Handke&#39;s inimitable ability to portray universal, inner-worldly adventures that blend past, future, present, and dreamtime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
