  <title>Peter&#39;s Plight and Time Will Tell - Alyson Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PETER&#39;S PLIGHT 
At the end of the day on Monday of the second week, Glenn asked Jenny to work later.  It was an excuse to ask her out for dinner.  As they were locking up the building they discovered a small boy hiding behind a sofa in the reception room.  He was dirty and hungry and they discovered he was unable to speak.  He was about five years old and looked to be of hispanic background.  Glenn called on his friend detetive Ed Dunbar to try to locate the childs parents.  But, no one had reported a missing child. 
  TIME WILL TELL 
Ed was devastated when he learned of Pams disappearance.  Even after using his investigative skills he could find no trace of her.  Any clues left at the site of her abandoned car where she had been snatched, were washed away by the heavy rainfall.  The citizens of Bridgton turned out in full force to scour the hills for the sheriffs wife along with his deputies, Morganfields Police Force and the FBI.  But they had no clues to where she had been taken.  His guts told him she was somewhere in this dense forest.  He was shaken, couldnt sleep, couldnt eat, prowling night and day, following every lead but to no avail.  With his brother by his side he wouldnt give up.  He knew instinctively that Rufus Tanner was hehind it.  It as was as though Pam had vanished off the face of the earth!" />
