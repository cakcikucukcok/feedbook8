      <meta name="description" content="Can you ever forgive me for being so immature and so wrong to ramble on the street of Garrison? Lee talking to himself, Garrison! You have something to say, the evil street that killed my dream at my younger age, he says, remembering the old odd days. Although his conscience was accusing him as he was rambling on the street of Garrison, he denied it until he experienced the life-giving street of Keren Lalai, thanks to Mike, his friends good advice. Lee thought he knew, and he is well aware of all the dedication of his grandma. He is tied by the dirty business he has started, right from the beginning. Grandma struggling against the bad influence of the Street of Garrison and Lee resisting to the end to be part of it. As the saying goes, It is shaken but never fallen on the ground. Despite all her effort, she is not able to convince her grandson, as she was alive in her lifetime." />
