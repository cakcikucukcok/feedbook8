  <title>Time Travel at Jagged Rock Lighthouse - Nancy Bayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A trip to Jagged Rock Lighthouse to take photos suddenly turns nightmarish for twelve-year-old Paige Johnson when she touches the first Lightkeepers journal and is whisked back to 1910. She cant figure out how to get back to the present day. She meets Keeper Nels Christiansen, who isnt sure she is from the future but doesnt have any other explanation. So Paige, who is stuck there, has no choice but to start living the 1910 way, wearing long skirts, milking cows, and washing laundry in Lake Superior. She starts to enjoy the family and lighthouse-keeping. The Christiansens come to love her too. After many adventures, she is faced with two choices:  If she goes back to her broken family in the present, she has the possibility of more time travel. If she remains with the Christiansens, who love her, she will be caught in their time forever. She must figure out the consequences of each choice and make her irrevocable decision. Which will she choose? Turn to the pages inside and find out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
