  <title>Sons and Lovers (with an introduction by Mark Schorer) - D. H. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1913, “Sons and Lovers” is D. H. Lawrence’s provocative semi-autobiographical novel. The work is based in part on his own family, his mother married a miner like the matriarch of the novel and consequently felt constrained by being relegated to a working class life. The story reflects the struggles of Paul Morel, an artist who cannot reciprocate love for other women while under the influence of his stifling mother. Unconsciously taught to despise his father and eschew other women, Paul comes even further under his mother’s psychological grip after the death of his older brother. When he eventually does fall in love, the results of his confused affection and desire are painful for all concerned. What follows is a tragic struggle for Paul between the desire for a normal loving relationship and the innate sense of love and fidelity he feels for his mother. While “Sons and Lovers”, for its Oedipal allusions and conflict with contemporary views on sexuality, was considered scandalous when first published, it has come to be regarded as one of Lawrence’s greatest works, his earliest masterpiece. This edition is printed includes an introduction by Mark Schorer and a biographical afterword." />
