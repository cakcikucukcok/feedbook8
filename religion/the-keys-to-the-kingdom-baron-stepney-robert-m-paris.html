  <title>The Keys to the Kingdom - Baron Stepney, Robert M. Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Baron and Rob arrived at Butner Federal Correctional Institution on the same day. They soon discovered that they were both Christians with a passionate zeal for the things of God. They began spending a lot of time together in the word of God. They experienced a higher quality and caliber of revelation than they ever had individually. Just as Jesus sent His disciples/apostles out by twos, Baron and Rob were sent on a specific commission. The message, word and ministry was simple: Love. The Body of Christ was being called higher, but this spiritual reformation could only take place upon a solid foundation of love.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter depicting an experience on Baron and Robs journey is followed by a chapter of revelation they received, or a kingdom key.This book is not for comfortable or complacent Christians, but for true disciples who yearn for Gods kingdom to come. Also for His will to be done through them, on earth as it is in heaven. The Keys To The Kingdom- Book One: Love is autobiographical, spiritually full of impact, and the first of a trilogy chronicling a tow-year period of illumination, inspiration, training and kingdom service.&lt;/p&gt;" />
