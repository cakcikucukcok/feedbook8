  <title>Prescriptions for Living: Inspirational Lessons for a Joyful, Loving Life - Bernie S. Siegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; As a physician who has cared for and counseled innumerable patients, Bernie S. Siegel embraces a philosophy that is at the forefront of a society grappling with medical ethics and spiritual issues. His books &lt;em&gt; Love, Medicine, and Miracles&lt;/em&gt; (1986), &lt;em&gt; Peace, Love and Healing&lt;/em&gt; (1989), and &lt;em&gt; How to Live Between Office Visits&lt;/em&gt; (1993) have broken new ground in the field of healing. Over a span of twenty years, other physicians have become increasingly receptive to his message. Bernie&#39;s efforts have now turned toward humanizing medical care and medical education, and he continues to travel extensively with his wife, Bobbie, to speak at and run workshops, sharing his techniques and experiences. Bernie and Bobbie have five children and six grandchildren (so far).    &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;This book is a continuation of the work I began when I became Bernie. It is a collection of stories about how to deal with life&#39;s difficulties. Most of the people in these stories have not had the great wake-up call; that is, they are mot facing life-threatening illnesses. So in a sense, this book is preventive medicine. It is a prescription for living that gives you effective and healthy ways of dealing with the adversity that occurs in everyone&#39;s life. I want to help you learn to accept your morality before something catastrophic brings you face-to-face with the end of your life.&quot; &lt;br /&gt; -- From the Introduction &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
