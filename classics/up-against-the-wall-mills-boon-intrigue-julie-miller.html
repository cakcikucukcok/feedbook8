          &lt;strong&gt;He was built like a tank, and he was undercover in Kansas City&#39;s seediest district.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Waist-deep in the trouble that came along with the Vice Squad, Seth Cartwright had unwanted company. After several years, investigative reporter Rebecca Page was fi nally getting her chance to uncover the truth behind her father&#39;s death–if she could swing Seth to her side.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was no debating that Seth ignited her temper, along with something else at her core. He said he was no longer a cop, though Rebecca suspected there was more to Seth than met the eye. And awaiting them was a deadly secret that KC&#39;s most ruthless criminal minds will do anything to keep buried deep forever.&lt;/p&gt;
