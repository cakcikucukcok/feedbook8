  <title>When a Prophet Cries - Prophet Brody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHEN A PROPHET CRIES BOOK SUMMARY:
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a prophet cries is a practical book about the prophetic calling that will inspire the spiritually mature as well as the milk drinker.   One day as I was listening to the Holy Spirit, He asked me what is 7 x 7.  I was so stunned by the question that I could hardly recall the answer.  He went on to ask how old are you?   It occurred to me that both answers were 49.  He continued...   That you may know  I still use my prophets to mark certain events, go to Leviticus 25.  When I began to read about the 7 x 7 years in the eighth chapter, I was flabbergasted!  I realized that my age directly correlates to the year of overflow preceding the year of Jubilee for this season.   I asked the Lord for confirmation of this fresh revelation and He gave it.  I was listening to a bible on cassette one day and the following words leaped out at me And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.  On another day these words seemed to leap from the pages I was reading, And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee.  I remember thinking the sixth month of what.  It was then that the Spirit of God took me to this verse in Luke 1:36 And behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.!!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
This book  was written by the inspiration and insistence of the Holy Spirit.  He anointed me to write and I obeyed.  The result was a book that has activated many of my sample audience to seek a closer relationship with God.  A teenaged reader said that she began to cry while reading &quot;When a prophet cries!&quot; and she has felt closer to the Lord ever since.  She said that her whole life was changed.   A young lady from my gym said that is an awesome book.  I just had to read it over and over.  I have received countless phone calls from people commenting on how their lives have been touched by this writing. I believe this writing will attest to the fact that God has a personal interest in His people, so much so that He has mandated that the prophets speak forth his heart to them.  I am anointed to write for this season to a people who are hungry and thirsty for the living word of God.  Though many messages have gone before this book  is a holy designation for that portion of the body of Christ that are desiderate for a rhema from the Spirit of God!
