  <title>Spiritual Breath - Konstantin Serebrov, Gouri Gozalov, Robin Winckel-Mellish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Kriya technique is one of the most important inner techniques on the spiritual Path, as it is one of few techniques that leads the practitioner firmly towards enlightenment. It also has another quality: Kriya doesn&amp;rsquo;t make severe demands (including sexual demands) on the practitioner, and so married couples can follow the spiritual Path with the help of the Kriya techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In the alchemical tradition, the Kriya technique can be applied to all the stages of alchemical transformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When a disciple works on the transformation of his or her materia prima, that is the uroboros, Kriya should be exercised for 14 minutes in the morning and in the evening. Disciples should further exercise the techniques to regain the energy which was lost in the past; the techniques of transforming the horizontal karma and the techniques to purify the soul. For these purposes a practitioner may use various techniques of reconsideration which are described in my book &amp;lsquo;The Disciple and the Path.&amp;rsquo; Regular church visits are also necessary, plus the inward so-called &amp;lsquo;prayer of forgiveness&amp;rsquo;. This prayer releases you from burdening past relationships, as well as those in the present, which hamper your progress on the spiritual Path. In the first stages it&amp;rsquo;s also necessary to practice techniques for the transformation of sexual energy. These practices belong to the Tao tradition and are described in my book &amp;lsquo;Tao techniques: Tao alchemy in the Hermetic tradition&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
In the next stages of alchemical transformation, the above-mentioned techniques become auxiliary techniques. Kriya techique becomes the principal technique which allows the consciousness of an adept to grow and perceive the divine revelations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
