  <title>Improving passing precision during running movements (TU 2) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of this training unit is to improve the passing precision during running movements, in particular. Following warm-up consisting of combined running moves and passing variants and a short game, the players practice passing while running at full speed during the ball familiarization phase. The goalkeeper warm-up shooting and the subsequent series of shots also focus on playing passes while running at full speed. A second series of shots combines double passes on a defined running path with quick passes in direction of the goal. Finally, the players practice playing precise passes under pressure in a small group game and a closing game.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Short game (15/25)
- Ball familiarization (10/35)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/45)
- Offense/Series of shots (10/55)
- Offense/Series of shots (15/70)
- Offense/Small groups (10/80)
- Closing game (10/90)
Training unit total time: 90 min.
Difficulty: Simple requirement (all youth and adult teams)" />
