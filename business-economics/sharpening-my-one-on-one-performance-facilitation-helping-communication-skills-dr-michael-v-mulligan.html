&lt;p&gt;In section one, the reader will have the opportunity to take three assessment surveys to learn where they are functioning as a perfromance facilitator &amp; helping communicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In section two, the reader will learn the two parts of the Model-the three stages of The Performance Faciltiaton Process and the three Helping Communication Skills that need to be mastered and executed.&lt;/p&gt;
