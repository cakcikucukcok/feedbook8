        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Alaskan tundra - a land whose pristine beauty was overshadowed by the darkness of winter, the danger of corruption.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her career hung in the balance, her life was on the line, and, after one reckless moment in a stranger&#39;s embrace, Lauren Fotheringay&#39;s heart was, too . He was a tribal cop working undercover as an oil rig roughneck to catch a corporate thief and win back his FBI job. But Seth Adams hadn&#39;t counted on murder. Hadn&#39;t been prepared to fall for his prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instinct, however, told him the beautiful geologist was innocent, a mere pawn in a deadly plan. And as the danger around them escalated, the passion between them intensified as they raced against time to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
