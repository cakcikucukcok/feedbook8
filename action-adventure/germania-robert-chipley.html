      <meta name="description" content="Hans Klug has a past he doesnt want revealed. A former East German border guard and American expert with the Ministry for State Security, Hans now ekes out a meager living as an interpreter. He is accosted on the street by a woman who demands 100,000 euros, or she will expose his role in the death years ago of an escapee at the frontier.&lt;p&gt;
Hans seeks assistance from his former colleagues, who in return for the money ask him to help locate the Black Vault, a chamber built by the Nazis beneath the streets of Berlin,   filled with gold and diamonds looted from death camp victims. The key to the vault is held by an SS-man who escaped to America after the war. Only Hans, with his fluent English, is the right man for the job of traveling to America to track him down.&lt;p&gt; 
Many obstacles stand in Hans way, including a former Communist party official, a neo-fascist history professor at a Bible college in Virginia, and the daughter of the SS-man. Hans must deal not only with these present perils but the shame of the pasthis grandfather, a highly decorated SS-officer, helped destroy the Warsaw Ghetto." />
