  <title>That Old Black Magic - Tales With a Twist Volume 2 - Ronald Slaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="That Old Black Magic Vol.2 is a collection of thought-provoking stories mixing the real with the unreal, the wonderful with the frightening, and the Good with the Evil. It offers the promise that something insightful can be found even in the worse of experiences:     &quot;You think you&#39;re so smart,&quot; the old woman said with a smile, holding the sleeping child in her arms. &quot;I could tell you everything and not a soul would ever believe you. You&#39;d wind up in a mental institution before anyone would ever believe a word you have to say.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Picture that: a kind, gray-haired old mother turning her grown son back into a child.&quot; She laughed harder. &quot;You can wander this Earth telling everyone, and you&#39;ll never get him back!&quot;   Mrs. Robinson, in &quot;Give Him Back!&quot;  Vol.2 adds onto the fourteen stories in Vol.1, and heads in fourteen new directions: a troll, a runaway, a loving yet suicidal couple, a pair of angels, and a sexy vampire, to name a few. So, what are you waiting for? Are you... scared?" />
