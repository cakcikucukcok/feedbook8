  <title>32 CALIBER - Donald McGibeny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story is narrated by the hero, Bupps, who is an amateur detective and professional lawyer. His sister Helen is in the throes of a painful and acrimonious divorce with her husband Jim who also happens to be Bupps&amp;rsquo; best friend. She is now involved in a torrid affair with a man called Frank Woods who, as Bupps discovers doesn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy a very clean reputation. Woods is a war-profiteer and his transactions have a seamy side. Things take a menacing turn when Jim is found mysteriously dead in a car accident. Bupps&amp;rsquo; suspicious are aroused by certain strange circumstances that occurred during the accident. From here on, the plot takes readers on a roller coaster ride through sinister Bolshevik conspiracies, high society country clubs and deadly pursuit through barren landscapes, ending in a most unexpected denouement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in first person, the book&amp;rsquo;s hero exemplifies the typical pulp hero &amp;ndash; tough, uncompromising and smart, yet with a tender heart beneath! Modern-day readers may recognize the forbears of James Bond and countless other best-seller heroes in 32 Caliber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Audio Book of this title is also available for free at iboo.com/en/audio-books&lt;/p&gt;" />
