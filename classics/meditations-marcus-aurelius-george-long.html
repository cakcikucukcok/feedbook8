The &amp;quot;Meditations,&amp;quot; which he wrote in Greek, are among the most noteworthy expressions of this system, and exhibit it favorably on its practical side.

Simple in style and sincere in tone, they record for all time the height reached by pagan aspiration in its effort to solve the problem of conduct." />
