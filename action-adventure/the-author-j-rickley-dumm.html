  <title>The Author - J. Rickley Dumm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Except for a 1962 primrose Cadillac convertible, disgraced and discredited Pulitzer Prize winning author, Antonio Delgado, has virtually lost everything, and on the edge of losing himself.&lt;br /&gt;
He suffers bereavement and pain, strife and turmoil, misery and defeat in the depths of hopelessness from which he, himself, created.&lt;br /&gt;
His wife is dead, his daughter is estranged, and he&amp;rsquo;s without a hint of credibility and any redemptive horizon. What happens to a man like that?&lt;br /&gt;
Antonio Delgado is about to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
At no fault of his own, unexpectedly, perhaps ironically, he encounters a tragic line that should never be crossed, yet too often is, in his former chosen genre that once took him down the thousand mile road to the horizon, and to the top of his game: A mass shooting!&lt;/p&gt;" />
