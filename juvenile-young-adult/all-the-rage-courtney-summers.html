  <title>All the Rage - Courtney Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named a &quot;Best Book of 2015&quot; by Bustle, Book Riot, Chicago Public Library, Quill and Quire, and the B&amp;N Teen Blog!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff&#39;s son, Kellan Turner, is not the golden boy everyone thinks he is, and Romy Grey knows that for a fact. Because no one wants to believe a girl from the wrong side of town, the truth about him has cost her everything-friends, family, and her community. Branded a liar and bullied relentlessly by a group of kids she used to hang out with, Romy&#39;s only refuge is the diner where she works outside of town. No one knows her name or her past there; she can finally be anonymous. But when a girl with ties to both Romy and Kellan goes missing after a party, and news of him assaulting another girl in a town close by gets out, Romy must decide whether she wants to fight or carry the burden of knowing more girls could get hurt if she doesn&#39;t speak up. Nobody believed her the first time-and they certainly won&#39;t now-but the cost of her silence might be more than she can bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a shocking conclusion and writing that will absolutely knock you out, Courtney Summers&#39; new novel &lt;i&gt;All the Rage&lt;/i&gt; examines the shame and silence inflicted upon young women in a culture that refuses to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
