  <title>I Am Where I Come From - Melanie Benson Taylor, Andrew Garrod, Robert Kilkenny, K. Tsianina Lomawaima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The organizing principle for this anthology is the common Native American heritage of its authors; and yet that thread proves to be the most tenuous of all, as the experience of indigeneity differs radically for each of them. While many experience a centripetal pull toward a cohesive Indian experience, the indications throughout these essays lean toward a richer, more illustrative panorama of difference. What tends to bind them together are not cultural practices or spiritual attitudes per se, but rather circumstances that have no exclusive province in Indian country: that is, first and foremost, poverty, and its attendant symptoms of violence, substance abuse, and both physical and mental illness. . . . Education plays a critical role in such lives: many of the authors recall adoring school as young people, as it constituted a place of escape and a rare opportunity to thrive. . . .

&lt;p&gt;Three of the essays from the earlier book are gathered into a section titled “Continuing Education,” each followed by a shorter reflection from the author on his or her experience since writing the original essay.
