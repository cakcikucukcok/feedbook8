      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This fresh, smart novel in the guise of a celebrity memoir probes the inner life of a mega-famous pop star&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Honestly, what amazes me the most with a lot of the people I meet is that they think they&#39;re so big. They think, ultimately, that the universe revolves around them. And I&#39;m beginning to think that it&#39;s only when you live a life like mine--it&#39;s only when you&#39;re in a position where you don&#39;t even really own yourself, when you can&#39;t even really say that you&#39;re a citizen of any particular country--that you realize that we&#39;re all just tiny pieces of cosmic dust floating through the void until we disappear forever and we&#39;re never heard from again. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins the life story of our uber famous twenty-two year old narrator. A teen idol since he was twelve, when a video of him singing went viral, his star has only risen since. Now, haunted by the suicide of his manager-father, unsettled by the very different paths he and his teenage love (and girl pop-star counterpart) &quot;Mandy&quot; have taken, and increasingly aware that he has signed on to something he has little control over, he begins to parse the divide that separates him from the &quot;normal people&quot; of the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sneakily philosophical, earnest and funny, Justin Kuritzkes&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Famous People&lt;/i&gt; is a rollicking, unforgettable look at the clash between fame and the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
