  <title>City in the Sky - James Glanz, Eric Lipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The definitive biography of the iconic skyscrapers and the ambitions that shaped them--from their dizzying rise to their unforgettable fall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a year after the nation began mourning the lives lost in the attacks on the World Trade Center, it became clear that something else was being mourned: the towers themselves. They were the biggest and brashest icons that New York, and possibly America, has ever produced--magnificent giants that became intimately familiar around the globe. Their builders were possessed of a singular determination to create wonders of capitalism as well as engineering, refusing to admit defeat before natural forces, economics, or politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows the history of the towers better than &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;reporters James Glanz and Eric Lipton. In a vivid, brilliantly researched narrative, the authors re-create David Rockefeller&#39;s ambition to rebuild lower Manhattan, the spirited opposition of local storeowners and powerful politicians, the bold structural innovations that later determined who lived and died, master builder Guy Tozzoli&#39;s last desperate view of the towers on September 11, and the charged and chaotic recovery that could have unraveled the secrets of the buildings&#39; collapse but instead has left some enduring mysteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;City in the Sky &lt;/i&gt;is a riveting story of New York City itself, of architectural daring, human frailty, and a lost American icon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
