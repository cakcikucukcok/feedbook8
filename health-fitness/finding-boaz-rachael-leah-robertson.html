We pray for love. We cry bitter tears when love seems to have let us down. The desire to love and to be loved fills our waking and sleeping hours. But more often than not, we don&amp;rsquo;t find what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for. We enter into a relationship that we&amp;rsquo;re convinced is &amp;ldquo;the one&amp;rdquo; only to leave it some time later, depressed and despairing. We promise ourselves we will &amp;ldquo;never do that&amp;rdquo; again only to repeat our behavior again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many of our lives, we find ourselves in haste for a romantic relationship. Sometimes we focus on G-d then love turns our head another way. Other times, we are willing to leave the comfort of G-d to gratify different barriers and lustful strongholds in our lives.
