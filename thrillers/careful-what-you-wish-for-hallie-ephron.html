  <title>Careful What You Wish For - Hallie Ephron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;There Was an Old Woman&lt;/em&gt; comes a novel about a professional organizer with a deadly problem she may not be able to clean up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emily Harlow is a professional organizer who helps people declutter their lives; she&amp;#8217;s married to man who can&amp;#8217;t drive past a yard sale without stopping. He&amp;#8217;s filled their basement, attic, and garage with his finds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other professionals who make a living decluttering peoples&amp;#8217; lives, Emily has devised a set of ironclad rules. When working with couples, she makes clear that the client is only allowed to declutter his or her own stuff. That stipulation has kept Emily&amp;#8217;s own marriage together these past few years. She&amp;#8217;d love nothing better than to toss out all her husband&amp;#8217;s crap. He says he&amp;#8217;s a collector. Emily knows better&amp;#8212;he&amp;#8217;s a hoarder. The larger his &amp;#8220;collection&amp;#8221; becomes, the deeper the distance grows between Emily and the man she married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Emily&amp;#8217;s got two new clients to distract herself: an elderly widow whose husband left behind a storage unit she didn&amp;#8217;t know existed, and a young wife whose husband won&amp;#8217;t allow her stuff into their house. Emily&amp;#8217;s initial meeting with the young wife takes a detour when, after too much wine, the women end up fantasizing about how much more pleasant life would be without their collecting spouses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the next day Emily finds herself in a mess that might be too big for her to clean up. Careful what you wish for, the old adage says . . . now Emily might lose her freedom, her marriage . . . and possibly her life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
