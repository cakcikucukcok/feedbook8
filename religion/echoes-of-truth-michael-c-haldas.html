  <title>Echoes of Truth - Michael C. Haldas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a professor, master of language and myth, and a loving husband and father, J.R.R. Tolkien was a devout Christian. He saw the Gospel of Christianity as myth come true within human history and all great stories in the world as reflecting elements of this truth. His love of these, and his Christian faith, flowed into his work, mingling to create a great work of beauty for all to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;can be read from many perspectives, offering a rich experience for both Christians and non-Christians alike.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Echoes of Truth: Christianity in The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;explores the Gospel, Christian themes, and Biblical archetypes in J.R.R. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s great masterpiece, with a strong focus on the author&amp;rsquo;s exacting language, along with commentary from his letters and interviews. Divided into two parts, the first half covers topics such as providence, spiritual reality,&amp;nbsp;good and evil, life and death, love and friendship, sacrifice, pity, and temptation. Part two addresses Christian typology, explaining how characters, places and events in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are similar to certain types found in the Bible, and illuminates how this&amp;nbsp;offers greater insight into the influences behind Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s sub-creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Collector&amp;#39;s Edition illustrated by Elaina Olga is also available.&lt;/p&gt;" />
