Only the year before, three astronauts had burned to death in their spacecraft, and since then the Apollo program had suffered one setback after another. Meanwhile, the Russians were winning the space race, the Cold War was getting hotter by the month, and President Kennedy&#39;s promise to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade seemed sure to be broken.

The race to prepare an untested rocket for an unprecedented journey paves the way for the hair-raising trip to the moon. Then, on Christmas Eve, a nation that has suffered a horrendous year of assassinations and war is heartened by an inspiring message from the trio of astronauts in lunar orbit. And when the mission is over--after the first view of the far side of the moon, the first earth-rise, and the first re-entry through the earth&#39;s atmosphere following a flight to deep space--the impossible dream of walking on the moon suddenly seems within reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full story of Apollo 8 has never been told, and only Jeffrey Kluger--Jim Lovell&#39;s co-author on their bestselling book about Apollo 13--can do it justice.
