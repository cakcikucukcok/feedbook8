  <title>Lost Teens Lost Faith - Derek Bird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;&gt;Commonly, previous generations of Christian culture emphasize issues that were pertinent to them, and they teach key doctrinal concepts while neglecting that which is essential to the healthy development of a Christian teen. In his book, Bird encourages a balanced approach while exploring faith issues most relevant to teens as they approach the years when theyre forced to grapple with enormous decisions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, he uncovers an innovative way to think about Gods purpose for an individuals life (which has the potential to not only affect the way teens approach life, but may also challenge parents and leaders to re-prioritize their own schedules), and then goes on to uncover a biblically based model for understanding Gods will, which happens to be conveniently situated at the center of his purpose for humanity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At a time when its more common for a teen to walk away from the faith than it is for them to remain engaged, Lost Teens, Lost Faith provides relevant dialogue generated out of Birds experience and his deep desire to see the reversal of this tragic trend. What he uncovers and passes along provides parents with the necessary foundation to lead their children through some of lifes greatest challenges. Birds scripturally inspired ideas give parents and teens a framework to begin a conversation of eternal importance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
