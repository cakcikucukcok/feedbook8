&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for North Shore Nuggets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
This book of legal nuggets, written by a champion of civil liberties in Minnesota, is educational, interesting, and fun to read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in our societys big issues.&lt;/br&gt; 
Nadine Strossen, Past President, American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/p&gt; 
These North Shore nuggets are excellent and wonderfully written. They should inspire people to move up to the North Shore and enjoy themselves!&lt;/br&gt; 
Dr. Matthew Stark, Executive Director Emeritus, ACLU of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt; 
Any article and any book written by Jim Manahan of Minnesota will always be of interest to Americans everywhere. He explains legal and social issues with clarity and precision, and his experience defending civil liberties is well known, not just in Minnesota but throughout the country.&lt;/br&gt; 
Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director, American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/p&gt;
