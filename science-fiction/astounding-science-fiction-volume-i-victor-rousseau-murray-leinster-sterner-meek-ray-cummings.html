  <title>Astounding Science Fiction - Volume I - Victor Rousseau,  Murray Leinster,  Sterner Meek,  Ray Cummings...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;astounding&amp;quot; stories?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, if you lived in Europe in 1490, and someone told you the earth was round and moved around the sun&amp;mdash;that would have been an &amp;quot;astounding&amp;quot; story. Or if you lived in 1840, and were told that some day men a thousand miles apart would be able to talk to each other through a little wire&amp;mdash;or without any wire at all&amp;mdash;that would have been another. Or if, in 1900, they predicted ocean-crossing airplanes and submarines, world-girdling Zeppelins, sixty-story buildings, radio, metal that can be made to resist gravity and float in the air&amp;mdash;these would have been other &amp;quot;astounding&amp;quot; stories. To-day, time has gone by, and all these things are commonplace. That is the only real difference between the astounding and the commonplace&amp;mdash;Time. To-morrow, more astounding things are going to happen. Your children&amp;mdash;or their children&amp;mdash;are going to take a trip to the moon. They will be able to render themselves invisible&amp;mdash;a problem that has already been partly solved. They will be able to disintegrate their bodies in New York and reintegrate them in China&amp;mdash;and in a matter of seconds. Astounding? Indeed, yes..." />
