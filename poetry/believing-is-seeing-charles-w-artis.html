  <title>Believing Is Seeing - Charles W. Artis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p.My favorite poets are Langston Hughes and Helen Stiener Rice. I consider my style a unique hybrid of the two. She looked for the beauty in nature and life. He searched for the truth in people and circumstances. They both encouraged their readers that life is worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My poems are a unique hybrid of what I call a realistic faith in Jesus Christ. My work doesnt overlook the problems, but I try to remind myself and my readers that God, through Jesus Christ, is greater than any problems that we have. He is not only the Savior who loved me too much to let me go to hell, both literally and symbolically, Hes the only way to heaven literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you have to commit your life to Him to receive His power to do His will and experience life in its fullness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its my faith and hope that whether you know Jesus Christ or not, these poems will draw you to seek a closer relationship with Him. And I know if youre sincere, you will find Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Him, youre lost, not God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
