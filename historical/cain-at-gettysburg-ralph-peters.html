  <title>Cain at Gettysburg - Ralph Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the American Library Association&#39;s W. Y. Boyd Award for Excellence in Military Fiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two mighty armies blunder toward each other, one led by confident, beloved Robert E. Lee and the other by dour George Meade. They&#39;ll meet in a Pennsylvania crossroads town where no one planned to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sweeping, savagely realistic novel, the greatest battle ever fought on American soil explodes into life at Gettysburg. As generals squabble, staffs err. Tragedy unfolds for immigrants in blue and barefoot Rebels alike. The fate of our nation will be decided in a few square miles of fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a tough Confederate sergeant from the Blue Ridge, a bitter Irish survivor of the Great Famine, a German political refugee, and gun crews in blue and gray, &lt;i&gt;Cain at Gettysburg&lt;/i&gt; is as grand in scale as its depictions of combat are unflinching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three days, battle rages. Through it all, James Longstreet is haunted by a vision of war that leads to a fateful feud with Robert E. Lee. Scheming Dan Sickles nearly destroys his own army. Gallant John Reynolds and obstreperous Win Hancock, fiery William Barksdale and dashing James Johnston Pettigrew, gallop toward their fates....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no marble statues on this battlefield, only men of flesh and blood, imperfect and courageous. From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and former U.S. Army officer Ralph Peters, &lt;i&gt;Cain at Gettysburg&lt;/i&gt; is bound to become a classic of men at war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
