  <title>Reds Under the Bed - Michael Komesaroff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who were the Reds under the bed? Why did ASIO snoop on several members of this migrant family struggling to set up a new life in Australia?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ASIO maintained a vast library of files on half a million citizens, most of whom were never a threat to Australia&#39;s security. Through meticulous research, Michael Komesaroff has been able to sift through a multitude of records which were kept on his family, and discover why. This is not only an account of one family&#39;s activities, but more broadly, a history of the widespread fear of the presence and influence of communist sympathisers in Australia in the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;A well researched and absorbing record of a respected family, highlighting its pursuit by ASIO. A great read.&#39;&lt;/i&gt; - Bernard Rechter, former director of the Monash University Centre for Jewish Civilisation&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;Michael Komesaroff&#39;s painstakingly researched but entertainingly written book dives deeply into two intriguing worlds - that of his Lithuanian/Ukranian Jewish migrant family, and that of the intelligence bureaucracy that conducted substantial surveillance on a generation of family members. Its focus illuminates - more clearly than many encyclopaedic accounts of the secret world - the dangers of mistaking dissent for disloyalty.&#39;&lt;/i&gt; - Rowan Callick, author of &#39;Party Time: Who Runs China, and How&#39;" />
