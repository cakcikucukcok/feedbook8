  <title>Bad Can Be Broken - Raven White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A rebellious and willful woman, author Raven White spent years stewing her organs in lethal concoctions of alcohol, meth, marijuana, and cocaine. Running from relationships and self-medicating was routine. Colon cancer and a life expectancy of three to five years became the cure she needed to hear Gods voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bad Can Be Broken&lt;/i&gt;, she narrates the story of how stage four colon cancer at first was her nemesis, but how it ultimately became the reason she now lives a life filled with love, joy, and peace. This memoir details her specific struggles, including being a cancer warrior, and it also discusses the challenges she faced long before accepting God. White tells how she believes the karma racked up in her teens through her late thirties led to having to swallow the weight of a life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touching on spirituality and maturing as a human being, Bad Can Be Broken offers hope and inspiration. White shows how she found peace and purpose and tells how it is available for others facing the same challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
