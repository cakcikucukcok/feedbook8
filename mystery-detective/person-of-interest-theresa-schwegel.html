  <title>Person of Interest - Theresa Schwegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leslie McHugh is married to an undercover cop. She thinks she knows what it&#39;s like to share her life with a man who spends his days living a lie, who keeps secrets for a living, who trusts no one, not even her. She can see the pressure, the fear, the pent-up rage, and, worst of all, the distance growing between them that Craig promised he&#39;d never allow. But what does she really know? Lonely, tired, and starting to drink too much, she knows that their marriage is on the rocks because her husband lives a second life she knows almost nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a thousand dollars disappears from their bank account, she wants answers, but before she can even ask the questions, their seventeen-year-old daughter, a real cop&#39;s kid already on a collision course with trouble, turns up at the center of Craig&#39;s investigation into a snitch&#39;s violent death. Leslie&#39;s had enough; she&#39;s determined to get to the truth and protect her family---no matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again and again, Edgar Award winner Theresa Schwegel shows a remarkable ability to get inside a cop&#39;s world---both at the precinct house and at home---making &lt;i&gt;Person of Interest&lt;/i&gt; some of the most compelling crime fiction in bookstores today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
