  <title>The Bells of Balangiga - Eleonor Mendoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In 1898, when the USS Maine was sunk off the coast of Cuba, the U.S.A. entered the war against Spain. By May 1898, Commodore Dewey won the Battle of Manila Bay against the Spaniards.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Filipino rebels were also fi ghting Spain at that time, trying to be free from more than 300 years of Spanish colonization. The rebels thought that the Americans had helped them become free; but the Americans had other
plans. On September 28, 1901, Americans were massacred at Balangiga, Samar. American rescue teams arrived, and subsequently an order to make Samar a howling wilderness was given. The bells used to signal the rebellion were taken as war booty by the Americans.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Forty years later, WW II breaks out, and they faced a common enemy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And long ago, a love that was in bloom was thwarted by a mysterious fate. Would fate now be kinder to another love?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Jack looked Victoria in the eye, when suddenly he felt his heart beat faster. He was hoping he could talk with her and her family a little longer, or maybe they would invite him for breakfast. Suddenly he felt awkward.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks for your help. Ill be seeing you around, he said.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He might have turned red. He could still sense his rapid heartbeat, and he hoped against hope that they did not notice. Somehow he was able to get back to his jeep and drive back to his barracks. John had been taking notes as she spoke, then he put his pen down and looked up. What happened that night, Clara? I just want to know, he said.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clara was already at the door, her hand at the knob, ready to fl ee. She looked back at John and told her story.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When you left, I was very happy, making plans with my mother. Suddenly Dolfo arrived! He had been looking for me all afternoon and was very jealous, thinking I was with you. He confronted me.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Where have you been? he said angrily and came toward me.&lt;/P&gt;" />
