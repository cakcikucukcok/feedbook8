  <title>A Time Not yet Forgotten a Time Before Hope - Billy J. Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first book in the series Time Not Yet Forgotten. This book, Time Not Yet Forgotten a Time before Hope, starts out about five thousand years in the past as the humans of Mars, or Nova as it was once called, are just starting to explore our solar system. Mars sends six ships to Earth, or Terra as it was once called, to start the colonization of the planet. While the Martians are starting to colonize our solar system, an ancient human race that lives beneath the surface of the Earth tries to warn the Martians that an alien race is about to harvest their planet to restart an ancient cycle that has occurred many times. Earths atmosphere turns out to be ionized and more than the Martians expected, causing all six ships to crash in different places on the planet. The Martians do not heed the warnings, and all is lost, except a small number of people who live beneath the surface of Mars. As the forest on Earth start to grow, the survivors of the Martians ships start to repopulate the Earth and begin the cycle all over. It is now five thousand years later, and Earth is starting to explore the solar system, but will they listen to the Martians when they warn of the pending harvest, and can anything be done to stop the cycle from starting again?" />
