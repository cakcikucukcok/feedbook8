  <title>Moving Day (Interracial 3 Black M / 1 White F Erotica) - Trevon Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s moving day for Christine and her husband Frank, and it coincides with their anniversary.  The movers are set to arrive early in the day and Christine is looking forward to a nice fancy dinner to celebrate.  When she brings it up, Frank begins to sweat a bit.
Christine can tell that her husband has obviously forgotten and there are most likely no plans for their anniversary.  He hurriedly rushes off to work as he tries to reassure her that there will be plans.  To try to entice him, she decides to take a picture of herself in a sexy piece of lingerie and send it to his phone.
Before she has a chance to change, the movers arrive and she has no choice but to meet them with a bathrobe wrapped around her body.  When she opens the door, she&#39;s greeted by an enormous black man and two other powerful black men.  As they unload her items, she received an accidental text message back from her husband, letting her know of his infidelities.
She wonders if she can get back at her husband and relieve a little pressure between her legs with the three big black movers..." />
