&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took my drink outside and sat back in my lounge chair to have a pity party for myself. I&amp;#39;d agreed to this arrangement. I&amp;#39;d agreed Amanda could sleep around, and all I could do was watch. What if she fell for somebody else? What is she fell in love and left me? Did I need to look at flights home? If I did leave the resort, should I even tell her? Would it be better if I just disappeared? And the most important question of all, if I felt so badly, why am I so excited?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do I want to feel the humiliation, jealousy, and pain of watching my wife with another man? Is that what I really want?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It hit me then, like a gut punch. I... was... Amanda&amp;#39;s... cuckold. I couldn&amp;#39;t deny it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In which case I should stay. I relished the idea of watching my wife have sex with another man. I could feel my heart squeezing at just the thought of another man pushing inside Amanda. I wanted to see it happen. I wanted to be humiliated by it. I didn&amp;#39;t understand the strong feelings I was having, it was wrong, but I wanted it more than anything at that moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must have briefly fallen asleep. I woke up with a full bladder, and an urgent need to talk to my wife. I went in to use the bathroom off the master bedroom. The blanket next to the stairs was laying bunched up, it was hard to tell in the dark if anyone was there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made my way quietly up the stairs. The bathrooms were connected to the bedrooms and I negotiated my way, still half asleep, in the partial darkness. My bare feet made no noise as I walked toward our bedroom at the end of the hall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh... James... I don&amp;#39;t know... you might be too big for me,&amp;quot; it was my wife&amp;#39;s voice. She sounded excited. &amp;quot;Be gentl ... oh, James.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pressed my body to the wall next to the door and peeked around the corner. My urge to urinate was gone, but my excitement remained. I wrapped my fist around myself, both to keep it from hitting the edge of the door and because it felt so good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
James was laying on the near edge of the bed, his legs on the floor and his back on the mattress. I could just see how shockingly long he was when held by my petite wife. She was standing next to him with her legs spread, licking his him while he stroked her between the thighs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know what you want, Amanda. You&amp;#39;ve been looking at me from the time you arrived,&amp;quot; James had his hands on her hips, trying to draw her closer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh... James, I really want to... but Josh wants,&amp;quot; she had to stop talking when he moved his hand to stroke her faster. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so... Josh wants... to watch... the first time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to shout, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m watching.&amp;quot; I had one hand on myself and the other on the doorframe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just let me touch it... like I did before.&amp;quot; My wife stroked him. She tried to wrap her tiny married hand around his immense shaft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t even get your hand all the way around it, can you?&amp;quot; he asked her. &amp;quot;Tell me what it feels like to hold.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It feels so hot and...alive, James. I&amp;#39;m holding a thick, living, thing.&amp;quot; She said again. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m holding another man.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was savoring the sentence. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m touching my wedding ring to you. Does that make me a cheater?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It makes you a hotwife.&amp;quot;" />
