  <title>Arsenic and Old Puzzles - Parnell Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Puzzle Lady embarks on another adventure involving one classic movie and featuring new puzzles by Will Shortz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an elderly boarder at a Bakerhaven bed-and-breakfast drops dead during afternoon tea, there&#39;s nothing particularly suspicious about it--except for the Sudoku in his jacket pocket. But when a second body turns up in the window seat and an autopsy shows both men were poisoned with elderberry wine, the Puzzle Lady suspects she&#39;s dealing with a cold-blooded killer who for some reason is copying the Cary Grant movie &lt;i&gt;Arsenic and Old Lace,&lt;/i&gt; in which two old ladies who run a boarding house poison elderly widowers and bury them in the basement. More murders, more puzzles, and a grave dug in the cellar seem to cement the theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, Cora would eat a case like this for breakfast, but for once she can&#39;t figure it out. And she&#39;s not sure if the clues don&#39;t add up, or if the much-married Puzzle Lady is just distracted by being involved in her first romantic entanglement in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arsenic and Old Puzzles&lt;/i&gt; is filled with laughs, mayhem, and fun new puzzles by Will Shortz. Mystery and puzzle fans will find much to enjoy in this latest treat from Parnell Hall.&lt;/p&gt;" />
