  <title>A Garden Inclosed - C. Leon Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written almost entirely in dialogue, this novel takes us into the lives of Ellis DeHart and his fair-skinned African-American wife, Rosa, as they search for answers to two shattering tragedies: the death of their son from a rare disease, and the refusal by Ellis&#39;s father to have anything to do with them. Rosa, the rational geneticist, thinks she knows the cause of their son&#39;s death, but Ellis, unable to accept the randomness of a chance mutation, turns to genealogy for the answer. Through research and imagination, he recreates the lives of their ancestors and discovers a more likely explanation. Ellis then tries to learn why the father he revered rejected him and Rosa after their engagement. Was it because of her race? Was it because Rosa&#39;s father was a civil-rights activist in the small southern town where Ellis&#39;s father&#39;s was police chief? Was Ellis&#39;s father involved in the killing of Rosa&#39;s parents? Ellis&#39;s recreation of that tragic time cracks the case but uncovers a secret even more threatening to his marriage to Rosa." />
