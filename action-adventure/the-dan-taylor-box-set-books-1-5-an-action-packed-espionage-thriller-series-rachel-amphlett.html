  <title>The Dan Taylor Box Set Books 1-5 (an action packed espionage thriller series) - Rachel Amphlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Get books 1-5 of the &lt;i&gt;Dan Taylor &lt;/i&gt;series in this action-packed box set!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This action-packed collection includes the first five books in the best-selling Dan Taylor series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;THE LEGACY DEVICE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The British Army left Iraq in 2009 after a six-year campaign alongside coalition forces. What they left behind has remained a closely guarded secret &amp;ndash; until now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Royal Engineer EOD operator Dan Taylor is on his last tour of duty when he is caught up in a conspiracy that will have consequences reaching far beyond the country&amp;rsquo;s war-torn borders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With no choice but to follow orders, Dan realises that the legacy he and his commanding officer leave behind will have an unimaginable impact on the future of Iraq, and that of the British secret service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;But first, he has to survive the mission&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WHITE GOLD &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor was a bomb disposal expert in the British Army until an IED killed three of his team and left him scarred for life. On the brink of self-destruction, Dan is unable to cope with the nightmares that haunt him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Until the day an estranged friend leaves a voicemail message for him, moments before he is assassinated in cold blood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plunged into a global conspiracy, Dan must unravel the research notes that Peter Edgewater left behind to locate an explosive device that is being smuggled towards London by a secretive organisation hell-bent on protecting its assets &amp;ndash; and time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;UNDER FIRE &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An explosion rocks a Qatari natural gas facility... a luxury cruise liner capsizes in the Mediterranean...and someone has stolen a submarine... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are the events connected?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor doesn&amp;#39;t believe in coincidences - all he has to do is convince his superiors they are next in the terrorists&amp;#39; line of fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Britain enters its worst winter on record, Dan must elude capture to ensure the country&amp;#39;s energy resources are protected. At all costs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an action-packed adventure, from the Middle East through the Mediterranean to London, Dan and his team are on a quest which will test every choice he makes.Assisted by the exotic Antonia Almasi, Dan realises he faces an adversary far greater than he ever imagined, and not everyone is going to survive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;THREE LIVES DOWN &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor has survived two attempts on his life. The rest of his team are missing, and now a terrorist group has stolen a radioactive isotope from a top secret government project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Can Dan survive long enough to prevent a nuclear disaster on British soil? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the Prime Minister determined to re-negotiate the country&amp;#39;s place in the European Union, and deals being struck behind closed doors, Dan stumbles across a plot that will shake the country to its core.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If his mission fails, his enemies will overthrow the British government, and Dan will be a wanted man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If he wants to succeed, he&amp;#39;ll have to sacrifice everything.&lt;/b&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;BEHIND THE WIRE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor is trying to keep a low profile when an old friend contacts the Energy Protection Group seeking his help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The man&amp;rsquo;s daughter is alone in North Africa, and her life is in grave danger.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a group of militants in pursuit and willing to do anything to stop him, Dan must draw on old survival skills and luck to make his way across the desert landscape and ensure Anna and the evidence she has in her possession reach safety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Behind the wire lies a secret &amp;ndash; a secret that people will kill to protect." />
