  <title>A Star to Sail Her By - Alex Ellison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2003, casting their fortunesand their livesto the wind, the Ellison family embarked on what they thought would be a one-year voyage on their forty-seven-foot sloop, &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt;. Five years and more than 25,000 nautical miles later, the family of four returned to the United States and dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, author &lt;strong&gt;Alex Ellison&lt;/strong&gt; chronicles his familys adventures on the seas. Culled from a detailed daily journal that Ellison began keeping at the onset of the voyage when he was just eight years old, &lt;em&gt;A Star to Sail Her By&lt;/em&gt; reveals his transition from enthusiastic child to capable sailor and reflective young adult. He learned two important lessons as they traveled from port to port: not everything always works the way it should, and change is really the only thing you can count on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Top 5 Book Pick &lt;em&gt;Yachting&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Star to Sail Her By is sure to entertain and inspire people who dream of adventure.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Castle, editor, &lt;em&gt;PBSkids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellisons earnest, genuine style is reminiscent of Robin Grahams in Dove. In crafting a twenty-first century bildungsroman at sea, with a tender family spin, hell leave you positively envious.&lt;br /&gt;Richard King, PhD, professor of literature of the sea, Williams College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A terrific tale of an unbelievable upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;Clint Grantberry, KLIF, Dallas, TX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In and of itself, this memoir of a 25,000nautical mile voyage is informative, entertaining, and eye-opening. That a high school student wrote it is astounding. &lt;br /&gt;Meredith Laitos, editor, &lt;em&gt;SAIL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
