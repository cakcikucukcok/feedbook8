  <title>A Girl Named Maria - Valerie S Kreutzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She was found abandoned in the lavatory of a cafeteria in Bogota, Colombia. The police who picked her up named her Maria Consuelo. From a stack of would-be parents, Colombias welfare agency chose Valerie Kreutzers application, and the toddler quickly bonded with her new mom in Washington, DC. At school Maria struggled with severe learning disabilities despite a superior I.Q., but also blossomed into an award-winning young artist. Her impulsive behavior led to fits and false starts during adolescence, until she found happiness at twenty-one with David and his extended family. Their love and lives ended in the curve of a rural road in Florida.
A Girl Named Maria chronicles an adopted daughters struggle with identity and her yearning for a birth family that may have included a twin brother.
Marias legacy lives on in this poignant personal story of one mothers unconditional love for her adopted daughter.
I loved this book! This story, although carrying the deep sorrow of a daughters death, will give parents of transnational adoptions a guideline for their own experience. This book is a much needed addition to the adoption literature.
