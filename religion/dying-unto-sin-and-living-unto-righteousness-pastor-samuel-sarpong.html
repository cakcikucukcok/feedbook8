  <title>Dying Unto Sin and Living Unto Righteousness - Pastor Samuel Sarpong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dying unto sin and Living unto Righteousness
The word sin is found hundreds times in the Bible in both the Old and New Testament. It is first mentioned in Genesis 4:7 (if you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door, it desires to have you, but you must master it)
The doctrine of sin is called Hamartiology, which comes from two Greek words, Hamartia, meaning sin and logos, meaning, discourse.
This harmartiology is the Biblical teaching concerning sin, its origin, definition, expression and final end
There are question concerning sins origin that finite man cannot answer. The word of God to the people of Israel in Deuteronomy 29:29 was; the secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but the things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of the Law.
Man must satisfy himself with the measure of truth concerning the doctrine of sin that is revealed in the scriptures, not seeking to go beyond it, knowing that God will answer the question in His own time.
It is evident that there is something wrong in the universe with both the earth and its inhabitants. The source of all chaos, disharmony and strife in the world can be traced to the existence of sin." />
