          &lt;strong&gt;WHERE WERE HER CHILDREN?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They were gone like a flash in the night. Now Kirsten Laurence was desperately searching for her precious three. And her only recourse was to elicit the help of Detective J. D. Ryder–a man with whom she&#39;d shared a past and from whom she still kept a very special secret!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though every instinct screamed not to become involved in Kirsten&#39;s plight, J.D. could not turn his back on the single mom who still made him long for what he couldn&#39;t have. He would help Kirsten recover her missing children…and then he&#39;d walk away. Unless he could admit that the eldest child&#39;s eyes strangely resembled his own…and that in Kirsten&#39;s arms he could come home at last…!&lt;/p&gt;
