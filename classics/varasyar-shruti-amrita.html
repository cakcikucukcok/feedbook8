  <title>Varasyar - Shruti Amrita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a temple servant- a Varasyar. The story of a young girl subjected to hatred by her family.
A childhood filled with her mothers love, a secret love for her neighbour Bharathan and a friend Savithri, kindness shown by a few and taunts of others. The Varasyar-Radhamani has a life filled with early loss and sadness till she meets Balakrishnanair, a young and passionate man who gets involved in the Indian Independence movement. 
A beautiful poem penned down by a teacher sets each of their lives on to irreversible paths. A secret society, an uprising and a rebellion twist and turn life at Puzhayorakaavu where Radhamani lives. 
Heartbreaks and mementos of an unfulfilled love are cherished hidden in an iron trunk. A promise leaves her wondering if Balakrishnanair really loved her despite everything.
Can an ordinary woman lead a Revolution? Can true love really survive it all?" />
