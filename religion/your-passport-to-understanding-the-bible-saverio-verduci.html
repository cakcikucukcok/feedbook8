  <title>Your Passport to Understanding the Bible - Saverio Verduci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his unique work Your Passport to Understanding the Bible, Saverio Verduci offers insights into the mysteries of this sacred book, one whose deeply coded texts have confused and perplexed academics and clerics alike. Certain events in the authors life caused him to study the Bible in depth. Over the course of many years, and after hundreds of conversations about the Bible, abstruse biblical scriptures revealed themselves to him, and he realized how properly interpreting scripture made a profound impact on his spiritual life and beliefs. 
Your Passport to Understanding the Bible is designed to help readers understand some of the Bibles key mysteries, making the Bible easier to grasp and hopefully leading the reader to a more profound religious experience. Deeper understanding of Gods word offers meaningful spiritual benefits and the strengthening of ones faith. 
Saverio Verduci believes that the Bible must be read as a book that interprets itself. One must understand the Bibles code, allegory, and symbolism. He has written this book to pass on what he has learned, in the hope that his personal experiences and studies of biblical scriptures will benefit others, bringing them joy and blessings through proper Biblical understanding." />
