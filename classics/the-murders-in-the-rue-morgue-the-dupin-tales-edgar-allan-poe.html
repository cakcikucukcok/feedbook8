  <title>The Murders in the Rue Morgue: The Dupin Tales - Edgar Allan Poe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While Edgar Allan Poe was most famous for his eerie tales of murder, ghouls, and suspense, he is also credited with paving the way for the future of detective stories with his character C. Auguste Dupin. Dupin made his first appearance in the murder mystery &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; a tale about the murder of two women. When Dupin questioned witnesses, everyone claimed that the murderer was speaking a different language, yet none of the witnesses could place his accent. Dupin put himself in the mind of the killer and read the faces of witnesses, suspects, and other persons of interest. He also drew inspiration and ideas from outside resources such as newspapers or police reports. As Dupin sought to unravel the mystery, Poe was creating an archetypal character that would be followed by many other great detectives. In the collection &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue: The Dupin Tales,&quot; Poe allows Dupin&#39;s genius to shine in stories like &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget,&quot; and &quot;The Purloined Letter.&quot; These tales are not typical Poe stories, but instead all follow the cases that detective Dupin solves after other police and investigators are stumped. Dupin showed that, with a little ingenuity and creativity, even the most difficult case could be solved. Mystery lovers and Poe fans will all enjoy this groundbreaking collection and the intrigue that Poe creates within it." />
