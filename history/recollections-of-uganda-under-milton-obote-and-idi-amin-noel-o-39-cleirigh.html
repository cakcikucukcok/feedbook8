  <title>Recollections of Uganda Under Milton Obote and Idi Amin - Noel O&#39;Cleirigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In this book the writer describes life in Uganda as seen through the eyes of an expatriate civil servant employed by the Ministry of Education.  He gives the reader an insight into a newly independent country transforming its colonial style education system through its Africanization policies, some of which he inaugurated and helped to implement.  A former member of Professor George Eogan&#39;s Excavation Team at Knowth in The Boyne Valley, he continued his interest in this discipline while living in East Africa and presents vivid pen pictures of some of the archaeological field trips and surveys he carried out on behalf of the Department of Antiquities  of the Uganda Museum.&lt;p&gt;
The book also deals with the history and tribal customs of the Baganda and Langi people as well as describing some of the memorable people encountered by the author..........the veteran CMS  Missionary Phebe Cave-Brown-Cave........Jacobo Obote, the father of Uganda&#39;s President Milton Obote.......the saintly Archbishop Luwum.....the formidable Mrs Enim,mother-in-law of the infamous Idi Amin......... &lt;p&gt;
The events recounted by Noel O&#39;Cleirigh throughout the pages of this book are set in East Africa amid a backdrop of President Obote&#39;s brand of African Socialism and General Idi Amin&#39;s Military Coup d&#39;Etat and subsequent Reign of Terror.&lt;p&gt;" />
