  <title>Artist, Soldier, Lover, Muse - Arthur D. Hittner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Freshly graduated from Yale in 1935, Henry J. Kapler parlays his talent, determination, and creative energy into a burgeoning art career in New York under the wing of artists such as Edward Hopper and Reginald Marsh. &amp;nbsp;The young artist first gains notoriety when his depiction of a symbolic, interracial handshake between ballplayers is attacked by a knife-wielding assailant at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington. &amp;nbsp;Yet even as his art star rises, his personal life turns precarious&amp;mdash;and perilous&amp;mdash;when his love for Fiona, a young WPA muralist, collides with his growing attraction to the exquisitely beautiful Alice, an ex-chorus girl who becomes his model and muse. &amp;nbsp;Alice is the girlfriend of Fiona&amp;rsquo;s cousin, Jake Powell, the hotheaded, hard-drinking outfielder for the New York Yankees whose jealousy explodes into abuse and rage, endangering the lives of all three. &amp;nbsp;While Henry wrestles with his complicated love life, he also struggles mightily to reconcile his pacifism with the rabid patriotism of his Jewish-Russian &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; father. &amp;nbsp;As war draws near, Henry faces two difficult choices, one of which could cost him his life.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Artist, Soldier, Lover, Muse&lt;/strong&gt; transports the reader to pre-war New York City, into the creative mind of the artist, and into the lives of major figures from the worlds of art, sports, and politics. &amp;nbsp;In the tradition of art-centered fiction such as Donna Tartt&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/strong&gt;, Dominic Smith&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Last Painting of Sara de Vos&lt;/strong&gt;, Tracy Chevalier&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/strong&gt;, and B. A.
