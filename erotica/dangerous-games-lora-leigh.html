      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leigh&#39;s pages explode with a mixture of erotic pleasures.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author, Lora Leigh&#39;s sexy Navy SEALs series, the &lt;i&gt;Tempting SEALs&lt;/i&gt;, is red-hot, sexy romantic suspense at its best, featuring men who will stop at nothing to proect their country and all they love no matter how dark the danger, no matter what demons they must face. And when these men love, their passion runs deep and hard.&lt;br&gt;Navy SEAL Clint&quot; Iceman&quot; McIntire earned his name by being the ultimate warrior.  He&#39;s untouchable, unstoppable and he takes no prisoners. Having crushed an infamous drug cartel in Columbia, Clint was nothing short of an American hero. Now he&#39;s home on a much-needed leave, but instead of some R &amp; R, he finds himself neck-deep in the hottest kind of trouble with his best friend&#39;s seemingly innocent little sister, Morgana Chavez, the only woman who has the power to bring him to his knees...Morgana has been secretly working with the DEA to uncover a thriving date-rape drug, which leads her to a shadowy faction that is more deadly than anything her team has ever encountered. Now, it&#39;s up to Clint to keep this beautiful, determined agent out of harm&#39;s way, even while the explosive passion between them threatens to consume them both. But these &lt;i&gt;Dangerous Games &lt;/i&gt;will bring Morgana and Clint to the very edge of high stakes danger and perilous desire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
