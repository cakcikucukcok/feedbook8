Words are simple, yet relevant, a toolbox of different ideas and principles that can be used by all ages: students, teachers, parents, children, preachers, parishioners, correctional workers, law enforcement, supervisors, and employees to educate themselves and others. Concepts challenge the reader to develop an out-of-the-box perspective on how to approach bullying and reduce its negative effects.
