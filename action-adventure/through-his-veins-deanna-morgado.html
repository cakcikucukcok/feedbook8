&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To the naked eye, Addi Clara lives the privileged life. A big house and a prestigious city to live in, a promised seat at her mother and father&#39;s company after she graduates and goes to college, and a circle of friends that have the looks and money to make things happen . The high life served to her. But she wants and sees none of it. Instead, Addi sees a best friend who doesn&#39;t quite understand, an ex-boyfriend whom she can&#39;t trust, and her parents who are forcing her to give up her passion and dedication for painting and go to a college she has no interest in after leaving high school so she can take part in their medical company. Addi is about a road with blinders on until her world is flipped upside down when she not so politely encounters a rather handsome boy named Dean in French class. Not only does his shockingly beautiful green eyes send Addi into a state of awe, but they hide a malicious past that Dean&#39;s kept secret to everyone outside his family for years. And despite his tries, Dean can&#39;t stay away from her. And Addi can&#39;t hide the love that slowly emerges. Soon what the two have becomes inescapable and Dean can no longer conceal his secrets from Addi. But with the secret on her tongue and Dean&#39;s love in her heart, Addi becomes vulnerable to certain death neither she or Dean saw coming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
