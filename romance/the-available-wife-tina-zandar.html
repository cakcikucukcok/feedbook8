  <title>The Available Wife - Tina Zandar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Devoutly religious and morally straight-laced Charlotte is aghast when her husband&amp;#39;s new employer requires her to &amp;#39;service&amp;#39; young, horny interns from Africa. Her first experience awakens long-dormant appetites that both shock and please her. Further complicating her life is a bizarre sexual encounter with her brother. Then, during a long weekend of exchanging partners,she is faced with a quandary regarding her devoted but randy son.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
He carefully positioned my legs over his shoulders, resulting in my cunt being even more accessible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Somehow everything came together. I was overjoyed that we climaxed simultaneously. His deep grunt as he ejaculated and the high-pitched scream I muffled by pressing my mouth into his shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still trying to stabilize our breathing, I looked up into his eyes. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re trying to knock me up, aren&amp;#39;t you, Hon?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded, slowly, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, Mom. All I know is that deep inside me is a feeling that I want to make a baby with you...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know. I can feel it.&amp;quot; I kissed him lightly on the lips. &amp;quot;It really makes me warm all over to hear you tell me that. You know, that we&amp;#39;re making love to create a new life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t mind? We can do it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I really hate to disappoint you, Hon, but every six months I get shots to prevent me from getting pregnant.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But next time...?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It can get kind of complicated if a woman mates with her so. Genetics, and all that... But what counts is that you want to... Want us to mate...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Holy shit! I understand what he&amp;#39;s proposing. It really does give me a crazy, stupid, warm feeling to think of him fertilizing me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled and shrugged. &amp;quot;Oh well, there&amp;#39;s always Sis...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stevie!&amp;quot; I said in mock seriousness, &amp;quot;You and Kimberly... I mean... You haven&amp;#39;t...?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you mad at me, Mom?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Should I be?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A little.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How long has it been going on?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;About a year.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Can I ask you...? What&amp;#39;s it like? I mean, with your sister?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Exciting!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Huh?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Kimberly is into experimentation a lot,&amp;quot; he replied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Like?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He took a deep breath. &amp;quot;Positions. Mom, can I ask you something?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You and Uncle Jack....&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, shit! What will I say?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I changed the subject by starting a new series of deep kisses." />
