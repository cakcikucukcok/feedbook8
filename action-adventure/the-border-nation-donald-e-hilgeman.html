  <title>The Border Nation - Donald E. Hilgeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maggie and Martin LaTour have been married just two years when she suddenly disappears during a camping trip to Mexico. When her disfigured body is discovered just a few miles from their campsite, the course of Martins life is changed forever.&lt;p&gt;
After returning to the States, Martin takes a leave of absence from his job and, while teetering precariously between mental disintegration and the need for revenge, begins to focus on a new life missionto stop illegal aliens at all cost. Martins sudden mega lottery win helps him finance a bizarre assassination plan that eventually rocks the tranquility of two governments. An unprecedented but predictable public outcry of human rights violations changes Martins tactics from committing brutal murders to coordinating organ transplant harvesting using illegal aliens as donors. After the NSA and Interpol plot to assassinate Martin with the help of his lover and a vial of deadly Polonium, a senators young daughter is diagnosed with a rare disease and an organ transplant is her only hope for survival.&lt;p&gt;
Through murder, second chances, love, justice, and betrayal, Martin battles an extraordinary turn of events and must decide if all he has sacrificed is worth it in the end." />
