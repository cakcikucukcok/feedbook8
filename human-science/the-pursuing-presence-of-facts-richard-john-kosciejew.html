  <title>The Pursuing Presence of Facts - Richard John Kosciejew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard John Kosciejew explores the goals of any scientific enterprise and analyzes the strategies employed in reaching those goals in this well-researched book. 
The philosophy of science offers a perspective from which we can examine and potentially evaluate the endeavors of cognitive science. Philosophy of mind offers substantive theses about the nature of the mind and of mental activity. 
While these theses have not resulted from empirical investigation, they have been applied to empirical investigations in cognitive science and its predecessors. However, the roles philosophy plays in cognitive science are quite different and must be examined independently.
Some philosophical views about science presented in this book are no longer widely accepted by philosophers of science, but that doesnt change the fact that they have been, and in some cases remain, influential outside of philosophy. Some of these older ideas have also provided starting points for current philosophical thinking.
Join the author as he examines the connections between philosophy and science and the ideas of Newton, Einstein, Copernicus, Galileo, and other great thinkers in The Pursuing Presence of Facts." />
