  <title>Imagining a Nation: History and Memory in Making Zimbabwe - Ruramisai Charumbira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Imagining a Nation,&lt;/i&gt; Ruramisai Charumbira analyzes     competing narratives of the founding of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe constructed by political and cultural     nationalists both black and white since occupation in 1890. The book uses a wide array of     sources-including archives, oral histories, and a national monument-to explore the birth of the     racialized national memories and parallel identities that were in vigorous contention as memory     sought to present itself as history. In contrast with current global politics plagued by     divisions of outsider and insider, patriot and traitor, Charumbira invites the reader into the     liminal spaces of the region&#39;s history and questions the centrality of the nation-state in     understanding African or postcolonial history today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an     interdisciplinary methodology, Charumbira offers a series of case studies, bringing in     characters from far-flung places to show that history and memory in and of one small place can     have a far-reaching impact in the wider world. The questions raised by these stories go beyond     the history of colonized or colonizer in one former colony to illuminate contemporary vexations     about what it means to be a citizen, patriot, or member of a nation in an ever-globalizing     world. Rather than a history of how the rulers of Rhodesia or Zimbabwe marshaled state power to     force citizens to accept a single definition of national memory and identity, &lt;i&gt;Imagining     a Nation&lt;/i&gt; shows how ordinary people invested in the soft power of individual, social,     and collective memories to create and perpetuate exclusionary national     myths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reconsiderations in Southern African     History&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
