  <title>Walking the Crooked Mile - Linda Schritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Walking the Crooked Mile&lt;/b&gt; was written for anyone suffering from the trauma of childhood abuse. All survivors have their &quot;crooked&quot; places. These are the distortions and faulty beliefs that are the legacy of an abusive childhood. No matter how skilled you may become at hiding from the pain and fear it remains within you. Unrecognized perhaps but still carried forward into every aspect of your life. Unacknowledged your pain masquerades as something else, bad relationships, poor self-esteem, eating disorders, addictions, chronic illness, pervasive anger... the list goes on. &lt;b&gt;Walking the Crooked Mile&lt;/b&gt; systematically dismantles the damaging misconceptions abuse victims struggle to live with everyday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book is divided into two parts. Part I provides information to build a solid foundation for healing. A series of exercises personalizes this information so it has specific meaning for you and your situation. Part II is designed to assist you in reclaiming yourself. It takes you step by step through the process of developing and then effectively using your personal power.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a victim of abuse you have been devalued, your basic rights trampled and your heart broken. As a child you had no choice or control over what was happening to you but you are no longer a powerless child. Your life and what you choose to do with it is up to you now. You can continue to settle for the crumbs off the table or you can pull up a chair and order a ten course meal.
