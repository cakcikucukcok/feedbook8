  <title>In the Shadow of Idris - Ruth Kirtley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Bryn can&#39;t make up his mind about Mary Jones. She doesn&#39;t go to church any more, and his mam says that Mary and her mum have started to follow the teachings of Outsiders. But to Bryn she seems normal and kind. What will Bryn do, though, when he discovers she&#39;s about to set out on a very dangerous road?&quot;
In the Shadow of Idris is a fantastic historical adventure story for children aged 8 to 11. Bryn lives in the same village as Mary Jones, and is drawn to the girl because she is so different. What will Bryn do when Mary and her mother get into danger? And will he help her get what she wants most?
The story is linked to Lifepath, a Scripture Union schools ministry event, and is a great follow-up for children attending a Lifepath event where Mary Jones is the central figure. The Lifepath events are loads of fun with puzzles, wordsearches and more, which help children explore basic Christian teaching and the impact that God&#39;s message can make on people&#39;s lives." />
