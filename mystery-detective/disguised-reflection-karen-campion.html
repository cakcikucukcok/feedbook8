  <title>Disguised Reflection - Karen Campion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At twenty-nine years old, Sari Clarke had it all: a blossoming career as a TV reporter, a successful defense attorney fianc, an adoring family and her two best friends  her sisters. Until one story, her first exclusive, threatens everything, and everyone, she holds dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A horrific murder has captivated Chicago. Sari is not only the reporter on this exclusive story, she is the exclusive. Sari takes the story to the public in her own way, in her own words. She is determined to single-handedly bring this predator down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a race against time as Sari and the rookie Detective Brad Callahan work against the Chicago Police Department to piece together the truth behind the lies. With each passing hour and each murder there are fewer and fewer people that Sari and Brad can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saris world is turned upside down in an instant. Is this a random act or is someone in her inner circle hell-bent on destroying her and her family? Will Sari make it out of this nightmare alive?&lt;/p&gt;" />
