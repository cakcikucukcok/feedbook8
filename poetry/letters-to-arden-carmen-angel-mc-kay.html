  <title>Letters to Arden - Carmen “Angel” Mc Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carmen wrote this letter with her hand on her pregnant belly and a
million dreams in her head.
Dear Arden
Will you like to read like mummy? Will you be good at math like
daddy? Your favourite colour? Your favourite hobby? Scrap-booking or
sound engineering? Your taste of music? (Please dont like that doof doof
music of daddy ;I)
Will you be dark or fair? Shy? Popular? Short or tall? Will you talk
a lot like mummy or be quiet like daddy? Will you like to dance? And
how on earth am I going to convince you to eat your veggies when both
daddy and I dont eat ours? Your favourite food? Athletic or poetic or
both?
Youll probably like singing... Whose eyes will you have? I hope
you have daddys long eye lashes. And will you be grumpy or full of
jokes? Writing or drawing? I hope you are born knowing how to style
your own hair (and mine) because girl, ma is clueless.
Oh Arden I think of these things and it cheers me up, it keeps me
going. You keep me going. Even on the worst day, you give me purpose
in the best way..." />
