His collections of poetry include &lt;EM&gt;The Pelt of Wasps&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Something for the Ghosts&lt;/EM&gt; (shortlisted for the Whitbread Poetry Prize), &lt;EM&gt;Nine Fathom Deep&lt;/EM&gt;, and &lt;EM&gt;Elder&lt;/EM&gt;. He is the author of one novel, &lt;EM&gt;Davies&lt;/EM&gt;, and has published four collections of short stories in the United Kingdom, including the winner of the 2013 Frank O&#39;Connor Award, &lt;EM&gt;Tea at the Midland and Other Stories&lt;/EM&gt;. He lives in Oxford, where, until 2012, he edited &lt;EM&gt;Modern Poetry in Translation&lt;/EM&gt; with his wife Helen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
