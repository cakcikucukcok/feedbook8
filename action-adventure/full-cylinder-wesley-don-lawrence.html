  <title>Full Cylinder - Wesley Don Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Psychological Thriller - A fast paced, action novel blended with a precarious, unintentional love affair which takes place in a U.S. Midwestern city
        with a population with a population of approximately 90,000. The story portrays the exploits of one man, whose task is to help his former comrade in a
        hostile land far from home in a span of only five days. Working alone with the help of his friends daughter, who is an editor at the local newspaper,
        he must carry out this dangerous undertaking in the time frame allotted to him by his superiores. The task at hand, although a dangerous undertaking,
        was straight forward---seek  retribution on his friends adversaries, but to get out alive would be a challenge. However, he was not prepared to fall
        in love with his best daughter. An unexpected relationship develops between him and the seductive young woman who would aid him throughout his mission,
        but this unintended, passionate love affair could jeopardize his entire mission and place both their lives in imminent danger. His goal is to seek
        justice, and bring down Nicklaus Vinchinzi and the people in his unscrupulous organization and others responsible for the orchestrated attack on his
        longtime friend and colleague. These were very dangerous times in the United States and failure was not an option. This story is about one brave man
        and woman who fought the lonely fight against mans oppressors, like the charlatans who hide behind cloistered walls, and the righteous do-gooders
        whose only ambition is to force their narrow, opinionated beliefs on others. It was a dangerous mission in a hostile land with no promise of the dawn.
        Working alone, he would attempt to take down the organization responsible for his friends misfortune and eliminate the man at the top whose sole
        function was to enforce the new regimes strict laws and to eliminate any dissidents who opposed the ruling autocracy.
        &lt;br/&gt;
         In every era of history there have been Paladins, men and woman who were not content to simply ride the crest of the wave, instead they choose to swim
        against the tide. And yes, such heros still do exist, even in the 21st century.
    &lt;/p&gt;
