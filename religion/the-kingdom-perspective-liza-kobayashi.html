  <title>The Kingdom Perspective - Liza Kobayashi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven is a prayer that has been prayed intensely by the body of Christ. I believe God is answering this prayer by directing Liza to put into writing what He has been teaching her &amp; what she has journaled as to what this will look like in each believers life.  This book is a timely message &amp; also a warning to the body of Christ.  He is coming soon.  Are we prepared spiritually &amp; mentally for the days ahead?  Liza talks about preparing ourselves spiritually by having our eyes cemented on Him, our ears hearing His voice &amp; His words of faith &amp; the call for each one of us not to judge but to see the plan of God.  Unity is key to the Kingdom. As you journey with her through her many encounters with the Holy Spirit, you will discover the power of intimacy. You will come to know the love of God, experience a supernatural increase in childlike faith, radically increase your expectation of His desire to be present in your life, and be challenged to a higher call and commitment.  As Jesus return draws near, it will cost each of us everything.  This is the cost of serving Him.  Are we willing to walk in this place for Him?  Are we yielded vessels that will surrender all if He asks?  The Kingdom Perspective is a must read to understand the challenge of the times we are living in today." />
