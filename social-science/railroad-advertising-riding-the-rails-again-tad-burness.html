  <title>Railroad Advertising: Riding the Rails Again - Tad Burness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Relive the glory years of American railroading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Return to an era when passenger trains represented the height of luxury and riding the rails was the only way to travel. &lt;i&gt;Classic Railroad Advertising&lt;/i&gt; covers nearly a century of memories - of powerful steam locomotives and elegant streamliners, of the brute force of diesel power and the patriotic effort to keep America on the move during a tumultuous world war.&lt;p&gt;    During their heyday, railroads employed the top ad agencies and some of the era&#39;s best-known illustrators to create compelling magazine advertising. The ads are a wonderful time capsule into a different era, a time when travel meant less about speed and economy and more about comfort and style. Through these ads you&#39;ll watch technology advance as railroads embrace streamlined designs and diesels locomotives; ride along as America fights a war, with railroads at front and center of the effort; witness a long, slow decline as passenger trains nearly succumb to competition from automobiles and airplanes, only to re-emerge with a new revitalized role in the guise of Amtrak.&lt;p&gt;    Join us for a great railroad journey in print - one that you won&#39;t soon forget.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Enjoy nearly 200 color advertisements&lt;/b&gt; and authoritative commentary&lt;li&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Remember America&#39;s greatest railroads: &lt;/b&gt;Pennsylvania, Santa Fe, New York Central, Southern Pacific, and many more&lt;li&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Experience the finest passenger trains&lt;/b&gt;, including the Super Chief, 20th Century Limited, California Zephyr, Broadway Limited and others&lt;/ul&gt;" />
