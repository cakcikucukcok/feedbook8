  <title>Have a Beautiful Day - Bryan Arndt PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I love early mornings, including that period of darkness before sunrise. It is during this special time of day that I can be alone with my thoughts, write uninterrupted, and feel as if I am at my most productive. 
Over the years I have also found the best way to begin each day is to thank the universe for the gift of a new day. These expressions of gratitude have a way of returning more of what it is I love about my life back to me. I have also found that a good quote, an affirmation or two, thoughts from our ancient wisdom writers, or words of inspiration from a variety of peopleespecially creative peopleare the best way to kick off my day.
I make every moment special and meaningful. I make every moment productive and rewarding. I make every moment positive and life-affirming.
Enjoying a lifetimes worth of beautiful daysthis is what I Imagine, believe, and create for my whole self each and every day. 
You can do the same; you too can Imagine Believe Create a lifetimes worth of beautiful days. How? Open the book to todays dateit can all begin right now.
Have a beautiful day." />
