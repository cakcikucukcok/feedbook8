          &lt;strong&gt;Raven Stevenson was in Lakeview barely twenty-four hours when she heard those ominous words. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d come to the small Virginie town to reconcile with her brother and forget the haunting memories of her past. She didn&#39;t expect to find friends, community - or a thirty-five-year-old mystery of tragic love. Nor did she expect to meet Shane Montgomery, whose love for his ailing aunt Abby breaks through Raven&#39;s carefully built defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Abby unwittingly shares some of the secrets behind that long-buried mustery, she and Raven are targeted by someone who wants those secrets silenced - and who&#39;s willing to kill both of them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
