  <title>Jack and the Geniuses - Bill Nye, Gregory Mone, Nicholas Iluzada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling authors Bill Nye the Science Guy and Gregory Mone take middle-grade readers on a scientific adventure in the launch of an exciting new chapter book series, Jack and the Geniuses. The perfect combination to engage and entertain readers, the series features real-world science along with action and a mystery that will leave kids guessing until the end, making these books ideal for STEM education.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; In the series opener, &lt;I&gt;Jack and the Geniuses: At The Bottom of The World&lt;/I&gt;, readers meet Jack and his foster siblings, Ava and Matt, who are orphans. But they&amp;rsquo;re not your typical kind of orphans&amp;mdash;they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;I&gt;geniuses&lt;/I&gt;. Well, Ava and Matt are, which sometimes makes life difficult for 1twelve-year-old Jack. Ava speaks multiple languages and builds robots for fun, and Matt is into astronomy and a whiz at math. As for Jack, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to stand out when he&amp;rsquo;s surrounded by geniuses all the time.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; When the kids try to spy on Dr. Hank Witherspoon, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading scientists, they end up working for him in his incredible laboratory. Soon, Hank and the kids travel to Antarctica for a prestigious science competition, but they find that all is not as it seems: A fellow scientist has gone missing, and so has any trace of her research. Could someone be trying to use her findings to win the contest? It&amp;rsquo;s up to Jack, Ava, and Matt to find the missing scientist and discover who&amp;rsquo;s behind it all&amp;mdash;before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Integrating real science facts with humor and suspense, and featuring an ensemble cast of loveable boy and girl characters, this uniquely engaging series is an irresistible chemical reaction for middle-grade readers. With easy-to-read language presented in a fun, motivating, and accessible way, this series opener is a great book for both inquisitive kids and reluctant readers. The book also includes information about the science discussed and used to solve the mystery, as well as a cool science project about density that kids can do at home or in the classroom.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Bill Nye&amp;#39;s brand new talk show series for Netflix, &amp;quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&amp;quot; is set to launch in Spring 2017.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
