  <title>Southern Writers: A New Biographical Dictionary - Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Robert Bain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This new edition of Southern Writers assumes its distinguished predecessor&#39;s place as the essential reference on literary artists of the American South. Broadly expanded and thoroughly revised, it boasts 604 entries-nearly double the earlier edition&#39;s-written by 264 scholars. For every figure major and minor, from the venerable and canonical to the fresh and innovative, a biographical sketch and chronological list of published works provide comprehensive, concise, up-to-date information. Here in one convenient source are the South&#39;s novelists and short story writers, poets and dramatists, memoirists and essayists, journalists, scholars, and biographers from the colonial period to the twenty-first century.&lt;br&gt;What constitutes a &quot;southern writer&quot; is always a matter for debate. Editors Joseph M. Flora and Amber Vogel have used a generous definition that turns on having a significant connection to the region, in either a personal or literary sense. New to this volume are younger writers who have emerged in the quarter century since the dictionary&#39;s original publication, as well as older talents previously unknown or unacknowledged. For almost every writer found in the previous edition, a new biography has been commissioned.&lt;br&gt;Drawn from the very best minds on southern literature and covering the full spectrum of its practitioners, Southern Writers is an indispensable reference book for anyone intrigued by the subject.&lt;/p&gt;" />
