  <title>Energetic Words Exploding in My Head Sent to Your Heart and Spirit - Maria F. Ciccone-Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This inspired journal of my thoughts, prayers, and aspirations was written when personal challenges in my life, as well as everyday living experiences, allowed me to step back from the chaos and place my questions and thoughts in the form of prose and poetry. When I had a question that needed an answer, I tried to solve and answer with the startling inspiration manifested in my mind, and as a result, it became the written word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both as a child and as an adult, professionally and non-professionally, I have always questioned my world and searched with a passion, on never-ending quest for answers to my life experiences. May we look deeply within ourselves and remember and bless the unique experiences that enable us to walk our path in this life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
