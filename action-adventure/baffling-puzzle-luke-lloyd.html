  <title>Baffling Puzzle - Luke Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The truth is in the eye of the beholder. 
This is a popular expression that enables many people to twist reality and historical truth to their own advantage without requiring accountability. Thus, political correctness becomes censorship, and truth is sidelined. Knowing this, Luke Lloyd, a retired army colonel who spent thirty years in airborne infantry and armor combat units as well as intelligence-related to the Middle East, couldnt resist setting forth the realities of Islam as he had studied and experienced them at American University of Beirut and lived with them while working in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Since September 11, 2001, Lloyd has taught and spoken on issues concerning the Middle East and authored an educational novel titled, Out of Darkness. He believes Islam provides our greatest national security threat because of our appeasing leadership and an unsuspecting populace that interprets it broadly as a religion but, in general, is oblivious to its political focus." />
