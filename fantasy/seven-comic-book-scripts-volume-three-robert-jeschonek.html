  <title>Seven Comic Book Scripts Volume Three - Robert Jeschonek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Comic book and superhero fans, rejoice! This volume includes seven scripts&amp;mdash;a mix of urban fantasy, mobsters, horror, and humor&amp;mdash;from a writer whose work has been published by DC Comics, among others. Robert Jeschonek has written plenty of scripts in his career, and these seven will shine a light on his writing process, his wild imagination&amp;hellip;and some thrilling and thought-provoking adventures. The latest in a series collecting some of his best work, this action-packed book includes seven scripts: &amp;quot;Hell&amp;#39;s Treasure&amp;quot;: A teenage girl talks to buildings...and the buildings talk back. Driven by guilt for a fatal accident, she plans to take a deadly leap, until a boy with mysterious powers gets in the way. &amp;quot;Pieces&amp;quot;: Body Sisk is literally full of holes. Rogue pieces of his body have escaped, taking on deadly humanoid form. His only chance at a new beginning is to hunt them down and force them back into place. &amp;quot;Made Guys&amp;quot;: When mobsters get super powers, can anyone stop them? Only the lowest members of the Temporale crime family stand a chance of standing up to the power-crazed soldiers and bosses terrorizing the world. &amp;quot;Mr. Straight-Lace Takes A Trip&amp;quot;: The weirdest man you&amp;#39;ll ever meet embarks on a search for love...and ends up hijacked by his terrorist sweetheart. &amp;quot;Made in J-Town&amp;quot;: Slices of life from a small town with a big heart and a past that&amp;#39;s a total disaster. &amp;quot;Solitary&amp;quot;: Super-mobster The Steel Sicilian can&amp;#39;t escape from the prison town of Sargasso, where no one will talk to him...except one of his jailers, who needs a solution to a very deadly problem. &amp;quot;Dirty&amp;quot;: In a world where &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and vice versa, the ultimate dirty cop leads a war against the scum of the Earth who perform acts of kindness. But when the cop is framed for good behavior, he finds himself on the run from the same corrupt establishment to which he has dedicated his life." />

Driven by guilt for a fatal accident, she plans to take a deadly leap, until a boy with mysterious powers gets in the way. "Pieces": Body Sisk is literally full of holes. Rogue pieces of his body have escaped, taking on deadly humanoid form. His only chance at a new beginning is to hunt them down and force them back into place.
