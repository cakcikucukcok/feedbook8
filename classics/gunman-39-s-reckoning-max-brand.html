  <title>Gunman&#39;s Reckoning - Max Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The fifty empty freights danced and rolled and rattled on the rough road bed and filled Jericho Pass with thunder; the big engine was laboring and grunting at the grade but five cars back the noise of the locomotive was lost. Yet there is a way to talk above the noise of a freight train just as there is a way to whistle into the teeth of a stiff wind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frederick Schiller Faust (1892-1944) was an American fiction author known primarily for his thoughtful and literary Westerns. Faust wrote mostly under pen names, and today he is primarily known by one, Max Brand. Others include George Owen Baxter, Martin Dexter, Evin Evans, David Manning, Peter Dawson, John Frederick, and Pete Morland. Faust was born in Seattle. He grew up in central California and later worked as a cowhand on one of the many ranches of the San Joaquin Valley. Faust attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he began to write frequently. During the 1910s, Faust started to sell stories to the many emerging pulp magazines of the era. In the 1920s, Faust wrote furiously in many genres, achieving success and fame, first in the pulps and later in the upscale &amp;quot;slick&amp;quot; magazines. His love for mythology was, however, a constant source of inspiration for his fiction and his classical and literary inclinations. The classical influences are particularly noticeable in his first novel The Untamed (1919), which was also made into a motion picture starring Tom Mix in 1920." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Gunman&amp;#39;s Reckoning - Max Brand</i></b> | Typical 1920's Max Brand western with a convoluted romance, not triangle or even quadrangle but a five sided polygon with the usual confusion in this type of novel. Boy A loves girl A but thinks she loves boy B who thinks he loves girl B who loves boy C. I could go on but I think that description is confusing enough.<br /><b><i>Gunman's Reckoning: Brand, Max: 9781546764304: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Max Brand was, without doubt, a formula writer but, as with the formula for Coke or Pepsi, that's a good thing. If you are looking for a comfortable Western read this, and all Max Brand books, is as comfortable as an old boot. With spurs of course.<br /><b><i>Gunman's Reckoning: Brand, Max: 9781388939649: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Gunman's Reckoning [Brand, Max] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Gunman&#39;s Reckoning - Max Brand</a> </h3></p><hr/>
