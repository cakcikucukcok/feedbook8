  <title>Ignite - Ron Shaffran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Speaking a language we understand, Rona Shaffran&#39;s poems tell the story of remarkable things that can happen in a broken relationship. These poems inhabit the sharp edges and rich depths of a union too long untended. &lt;i&gt;Ignite&lt;/i&gt; begins in wintry suburbia with a man and woman who have lost emotional and physical connection. A magic-realist plunge into the atavistic tropics of desire breaks this barren matrix. The exotic landscape sparks resurgent passion, which leads to a dramatic and healing turn-around for the couple. The poems of disappointment don&#39;t waste a word. The poems of arousal are sensual, succinct and poignant. The garden grows. The transformation is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straightforward on the surface, yet taking us to deeper levels of understanding, the poems are unflinchingly honest. Individually, they startle, and evoke primal recognitions. When read in sequence, the poems of &lt;i&gt;Ignite&lt;/i&gt; impel us to the story&#39;s conclusion. The man and woman come alive as their joy and sadness meld together. There is dignity in this progression, and the restraint that comes with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are poems for readers and lovers in all their seasons, yet there is hard-won maturity to the lovers in &lt;i&gt;Ignite&lt;/i&gt;. Everyday gestures transform into universal experiences, taking us to the heart of emotions and experiences of a lifetime&#39;s duration. The language, refined to bone-essential elements, almost disappears to create an intimacy with the reader, a collective energy, a human experience that we all share.&lt;/p&gt;" />
