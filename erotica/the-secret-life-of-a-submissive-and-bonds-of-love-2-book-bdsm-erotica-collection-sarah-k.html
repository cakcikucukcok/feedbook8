  <title>The Secret Life of a Submissive and Bonds of Love: 2-book BDSM Erotica Collection - Sarah K</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One woman’s true story of sexual dominance, submission and temptation, The Secret Life of a Submissive and Bonds of Love, now combined in a single eBook volume for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah K is an ordinary woman who longs to be dominated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Secret Life of a Submissive is her explosive account of life as a submissive, and of a secret world in which only a few dare to play.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Max comes into Sarah’s life – charming, handsome and deliciously brooding – she can’t resist. She surrenders to him in every way: he is a dominant, and Sarah becomes his submissive, yielding her body to his every desire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But as Sarah pushes her mind and body to its limits she begins to realise that she’s in too deep. Pleasure and pain have become her world; she’s addicted to the adrenalin, to the sensation and to Max himself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now she’s in serious danger of giving in to the ultimate temptation: falling in love…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bonds of Love finds Sarah still reeling after ending things with Max. As he had warned, once you’ve tasted the forbidden fruits of dominance and submission, you can’t go back. So when Sarah meets Alex – a tall, handsome man who shares her erotic desires – she finds herself cast under the dark spell of pleasure and pain once more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they explore one another, like an addiction, Sarah begins to crave Alex – his touch, his breath, his smell. Shocked at the emotions he has awakened within her, Sarah tells herself this is just lust. She had learnt the hard way that falling in love is one line that can’t be crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So why does it feel so wrong when Max re-enters her life, determined to possess her once more? Should she admit her true feelings for Alex, and potentially expose herself to the worst pain of all – heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hotter than fiction, this intoxicating and explosive true story will set your pulse racing as Sarah K strips away the mask to reveal what it’s really like to be a sexual submissive.&lt;/p&gt;
