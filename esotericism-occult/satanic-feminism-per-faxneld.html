  <title>Satanic Feminism - Per Faxneld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to the Bible, Eve was the first to heed Satan&#39;s advice to eat the forbidden fruit and thus responsible for all of humanity&#39;s subsequent miseries. The notion of woman as the Devil&#39;s accomplice is prominent throughout Christian history and has been used to legitimize the subordination of wives and daughters. In the nineteenth century, rebellious females performed counter-readings of this misogynist tradition. Lucifer was reconceptualized as a feminist liberator of womankind, and Eve became a heroine. In these reimaginings, Satan is an ally in the struggle against a tyrannical patriarchy supported by God the Father and his male priests. Per Faxneld shows how this Satanic feminism was expressed in a wide variety of nineteenth-century literary texts, autobiographies, pamphlets, newspaper articles, paintings, sculptures, and even artifacts of consumer culture like jewelry. He details how colorful figures like the suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, gender-bending Theosophist H. P. Blavatsky, author Aino Kallas, actress Sarah Bernhardt, anti-clerical witch enthusiast Matilda Joslyn Gage, decadent marchioness Luisa Casati, and the Luciferian lesbian poetess Ren&amp;#233;e Vivien embraced these reimaginings. By exploring the connections between esotericism, literature, art and the political realm, &lt;em&gt;Satanic Feminism&lt;/em&gt; sheds new light on neglected aspects of the intellectual history of feminism, Satanism, and revisionary mythmaking." />
