  <title>Evelyn Waugh - Philip Eade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NAMED A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY THE &lt;i&gt;GUARDIAN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SUNDAY TIMES &lt;/i&gt;AND &lt;i&gt;FINANCIAL TIMES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty years after Evelyn Waugh&#39;s death, here is a completely fresh view of one of the most gifted --  and fascinating -- writers of our time, the enigmatic author of Brideshead Revisited. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Greene hailed Waugh as &#39;the greatest novelist of my generation&#39;, and in recent years his reputation has only grown. Now Philip Eade has delivered an authoritative and hugely entertaining biography that is full of new material, much of it sensational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eade builds upon the existing Waugh lore with access to a remarkable array of unpublished sources provided by Waugh&#39;s grandson, including passionate love letters to Baby Jungman - the Holy Grail of Waugh research - a revealing memoir by Waugh&#39;s first wife Evelyn Gardner (&quot;Shevelyn&quot;), and an equally significant autobiography by Waugh&#39;s commanding officer in World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eade&#39;s gripping narrative illuminates Waugh&#39;s strained relationship with his sentimental father and blatantly favoured elder brother; his love affairs with male classmates at Oxford and female bright young things thereafter; his disastrous first marriage and subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism; his insane wartime bravery; his drug-induced madness; his singular approach to marriage and fatherhood; his complex relationship with the aristocracy; the astonishing power of his wit; and the love, fear, and loathing that he variously inspired in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Eade&#39;s aims is &#39;to re-examine some of the distortions and misconceptions that have come to surround this famously complex and much mythologized character&#39;.&#39;This might look like code for a plan to whitewash the overly blackwashed Waugh,&#39; comments veteran Waugh scholar Professor Donat Gallagher; &#39;but readers fixated on atrocities will not be disappointed . . . I have been researching and writing about Waugh since 1963 and Eade time and again surprised and delighted me.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waugh was famously difficult and Eade brilliantly captures the myriad facets of his character even as he casts new light on the novels that have dazzled generations of readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
