In an attempt to get Tracy to reconsider, her parents make a deal with her: Have her take a trip to coastal Maine where Victoria, an old friend of Tracys mother, and her son own a hotel. However, the deal is for Tracy to go without Adam so that she can think this proposal through without any distractions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;She takes the deal and her and her two best friends venture off to Maine unaware that the states tourism is suffering due to a series of murders taking place in the area.
