  <title>PRESIDENT REAGAN&#39;S UNSUNG HEROES - Gary Anton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a true untold story of American patriotic history. It is a story of how a group of ordinary American citizens became involved in US foreign policy and intelligence around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, the group was a household name in Washington, DC, and had direct contact with high-level officials, right up to the president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One senate investigator said, &amp;quot;It is like you entered into a world of science fiction and then you find that it checks out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story tells how the group, with their sources for intelligence, helped end the Cold War with the former Soviet Union, along with freeing several countries that were ruled by brutal dictators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Then there was a nationwide scandal, and the group was abruptly pushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many major magazines, such as: New York&amp;nbsp; Magazine (Christmas Issue) U.S. News and World Report, Time Magazine, Washington Post and Boston Globe wrote about the group, but the author, due to his privacy and well-being, had decided not to be involved in the articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now after thirty years, he has decided to write his true, untold story in American history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
