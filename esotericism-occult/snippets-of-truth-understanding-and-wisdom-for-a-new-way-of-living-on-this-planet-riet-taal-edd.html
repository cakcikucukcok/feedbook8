  <title>Snippets of Truth, Understanding, and Wisdom, for a New Way of Living on This Planet - Riet Taal (EdD)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A new way of living&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need to change our way of living on this planet? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this book, a definite Yes! Our attitudes, priorities, and the way we have looked after the environment have resulted in a situation that is no longer sustainable for a healthy and harmonious future for us and for generations to come. We have seen increased pollution of the air and water; diminishing forests, ice caps, and ozone layers; warming of the planet, resulting in weather and climate changes, and with that danger of extinction for many bird and animal species. And lets not forget: danger for the survival of us human beings! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we still do something about it, or is it all too little and too late? What is our fate? The message in this book can be considered a wake-up call, an urgent reminder to mend our ways, to change our attitudes, and to have a critical look at what is happening around us; what our roles are and what we as individuals and members of groups and communities can do to bring about change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not alone in this endeavourthe messages giving us support and encouragement are coming from a spirit source, channeled by the author through automatic writing. The special readings deal with topics such as: where we come from, what our purpose is, predictions and climate changes, together with information on relationships and finding inner peace and spiritual growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us all strive for a happy and rewarding outcome!&lt;/p&gt;" />
