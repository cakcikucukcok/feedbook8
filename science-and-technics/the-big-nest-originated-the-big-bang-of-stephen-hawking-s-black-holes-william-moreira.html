      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Author William Moreira has spent decades studying and seeking Godsometimes while flying high above the clouds in his Cessna. In that time, he has discovered that God is everywhere. Now, in this new study, he takes issue with Stephen Hawking and other scientists and individuals who argue against Gods existence. He seeks to disprove their theories and contemplates ways you can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; use your brain to discover the true nature of the universe;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; live in a manner that will lead to a happy place in eternity; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt; argue against the theories of Hawking and his constituents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;While some aspects of the universe will remain a mystery, its clear that God exists. Whats more, its up to you to find the right path to moral evolution. You must look at the infinity of the illuminated dark matter encrusted within the stars and, in exaltation, accept that there is a super power and that God is everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join Moreira as he takes on various foolish views about the universe and existence. You can find faith, understanding, and the knowledge needed to live a more fulfilling life with &lt;i&gt;The Big Nest Originated the Big Bang of Stephen Hawkings Black Holes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
