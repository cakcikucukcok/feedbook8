  <title>The Pursuit of Fairness: A History of Affirmative Action - Terry H. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Affirmative action strikes at the heart of deeply held beliefs about employment and education, about the concepts of justice and fairness, and about the troubled history of race relations in America. Published on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, this is the only book available that gives readers a balanced, non-polemical, and lucid account of this highly contentious issue.       Beginning with the roots of affirmative action, Anderson describes African-American demands for employment in the defense industry--spearheaded by A. Philip Randolphs threatened March on Washington in July 1941--and the desegregation of the armed forces after World War II. He investigates President Kennedys historic 1961 executive order that introduced the term affirmative action during the early years of the civil rights movement and he examines President Johnsons attempts to gain equal opportunities for African Americans.  He describes President Nixons expansion of affirmative action with the Philadelphia Plan--which the Supreme Court upheld--along with President Carters introduction of set asides for minority businesses and the Bakke ruling which allowed the use of race as one factor in college admissions.  By the early 1980s many citizens were becoming alarmed by affirmative action, and that feeling was exemplified by the Reagan administrations backlash, which resulted in the demise and revision of affirmative action during the Clinton years.  He concludes with a look at the University of Michigan cases of 2003, the current status of the policy, and its impact.  Throughout, the author weighs each side of every issue--often finding merit in both arguments--resulting in an eminently fair account of one of Americas most heated debates.       A colorful history that brings to life the politicians, legal minds, and ordinary people who have fought for or against affirmative action, The Pursuit of Fairness helps clear the air and calm the emotions, as it illuminates a difficult and critically important issue." />
