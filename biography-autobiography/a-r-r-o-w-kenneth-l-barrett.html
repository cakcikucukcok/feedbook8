  <title>A R R O W - Kenneth L. Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all live in a world of stories. Despite intuitions to the contrary, our minds have no direct link to realitywe all make our own reality with the stories we accept and reject. And if we have enough courage and creativity, we can even write our own stories. But the starting point to becoming the authors of our own lives is to develop a worldview, and questioning everything that enters our minds from our eyes, ears, mouths, fingers, and spirits is the beginning of this rewarding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In A R R O W: A Brief Sketch of My MindA Shot in the Dark, author Kenneth L. Barrett provides a window into the mind and life of a man whose storycombined with everyone elses storiescontributes to the story of everything. Showing how it is that the human mind writes stories that become our collective reality, he explores both the scientific and the philosophical as he asks the what-if questions so central to an understanding of the meaning and purpose of our lives. Ultimately, it is the arrow of time that penetrates and drives us all forever forward through a reality story that we all choose to believeor not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To construct a worldview, you must forever ask yourself the what-if questions. Finding your own truth and believing that your personal story is just as real, important, and interesting as any other story will energize your mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
