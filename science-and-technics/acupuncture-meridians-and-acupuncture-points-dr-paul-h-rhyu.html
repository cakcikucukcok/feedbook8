  <title>Acupuncture Meridians and Acupuncture Points - Dr. Paul H. Rhyu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the recent times, there occured a tremendous phenomenon in the field of Science.
It is the growing awareness of the importance of Oriental Medicine, notably the so called acupuncture, in America, Europe and countries all over the world.
Acupunture, as a field of medicine, poses a fundametal problem. It embraces a lot of complexities which must first have a through knowledge of meridians and acupuncutre points.
Moreover, there is a need for them to have a complete understanding of all the acupunture parts in the human body.  These can not bo acquired, however, in just a day&#39;s time.  Like any other field of specialization, it demands a continuous practice of learning and relearing.
In this connection, I am publing a book which will
serve as a guide for medical students and doctors
pursuing further studies in acupunture.  The entitle &quot;Acupunture Meridiana and Acupuncture Points&quot; possesses distinct characteristies for easy reading and understanding.  &quot;Acupunture Meridians and Acupunture Points&quot; indicates the exact position of these points.  They are located in various parts of the human body; namely, bone surfaces, muscles, blood vessels and nerves.
To aid readers in understanding better these points, the authors intentionally uses meridian classification, point&#39;s names and symptoms Korean and Chinese characters are also used for more depth.
The findings presented in this study, however, should not be deemed by readers as conclusive and absolute.  Liky and study, it assumes fallibility.   In consonance to this, the author seek your advice by writing to them so that a revision may be undertaken.
The author, I present any contribution it can be given to the people of today will be my honer and pressure.
I like to express my thanks to wife JiHye, daughter Sandy, son Alex, and all family folks for helps and support." />
