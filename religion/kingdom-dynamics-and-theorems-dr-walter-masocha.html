  <title>Kingdom Dynamics and Theorems - Dr. walter Masocha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explores some key biblical principles of the kingdom of God and relates them to some (very) basic math. It draws on geometry and divinity to come up with some innovative practical theorems that are sure to titillate your mind and spirit. Put your thinking hat on!
Once you are born again, you are expected to grow through: faithfulness, obedience, observing, and doing Gods Word. I call it FOOD for growth, GrowthFOOD, or simply GFOOD. Eat, and live!
The book teaches that everyone has a life cycle. We all have shelf lives, use-by dates, and best-before dates. Are you past your use-by date?
Furthermore, this book unveils a secret hidden in 1 Corinthians 12:31. Having church on the basis of spiritual gifts is excellent, but God expects his children to put into practice the agape love in its unconditional sensethe same way God loves us: the more excellent way.
Ever heard of the Pythagoras theorem? Unveiling the connection between the Triune God and the tripartite man (both 3 in 1), the book takes you through what I call the intricacies of divine geometry, some interesting mental and spiritual gymnastics. Every human being is a triangle, the equilateral triangle being the standard of all shapes. Moving from Pythagoras theorem to what I call masochagoras theorems, you are sure to find out what type of triangle you are! 
The book also explores the meaning of numbers. Discover their significance in your life. Some masochagoras theorems to do with numbers are proposed. Enjoy the intricacies of divine algebra.
True worship happens when the human equilateral triangle connects in agape love with the divine equilateral triangle. Let Gods kingdom come in your life. Apply the proposed masochagoras theorems and enjoy life in the kingdomforever!" />
