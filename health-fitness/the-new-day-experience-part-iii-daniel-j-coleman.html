  <title>The New Day Experience Part Iii - Daniel J. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You and I can receive the highest and best God has prepared for us. Our consistent spiritual growth comes from praying, reading, studying and applying Bible doctrine in our daily living. Bible doctrine creates capacity for life, for love, for Christian service, for blessing, for happiness. God has devised the design of the ages, the perfect plan for each one of us personally. All you and I have to do is understand His gracious offer and seize the incomparable opportunity for a life of meaning, purpose, and definition. This book will help to show you how to uncover the Plan of God which reveals Gods provision for your salvation, His purpose for your existence after salvation, and the treasures He has waiting for your eternal future on earth and in heaven. The moment you believe in Christ you immediately share His life and destiny. But for us to attain the wonderful peace, happiness, and contentment God has planned for our lives on earth, we must learn Bible doctrine and grow to spiritual maturity. The Bible communicates Gods Word to you and I so absolute truth becomes the measure of our conscience,and the motivation of our life. Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper. [PSA 1:1-3] The young and ever-growing Christian will face many challenges in their lives but we must remember: Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.[ 2CO 2:14] &quot;Thus says the LORD who made it, the LORD who formed it to establish it (the LORD is His name): Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.&#39;" />
