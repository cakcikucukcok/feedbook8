  <title>Pair of Jacks - Michael Batdorf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When thirteen-year-old, poker-playing psychic Jack Holden, Jr. is kidnapped, he begins a cross-country road trip like no other. He is soon leading a mission to find and rescue his missing poker pro father, Jack &quot;Texas&quot; Holden, from captors who force him to use his own &quot;Poker Power&quot; to make them rich.&lt;p&gt;
During his journey, young Jack makes friends, finds love, wins fortunes from the superstars of professional poker, and dodges bounty hunters who are out to stop him. In the end, Jack must choose his fate as his psychic powers and love for his family and friends are put to the test at the secret gambling den in the Nevada desert where his father is imprisoned.&lt;p&gt;
Full of suspense, twists, humor and action, Pair of Jacks is fantastic fiction, high adventure, filled with unforgettable characters and events.&lt;p&gt;
Michael Batdorf&#39;s writing has an amazing, fresh, unique voice.&lt;br&gt; 
Katrina Kittle, Author, The Kindness of Strangers (William Morrow publishers)&lt;p&gt;
Michael Batdorf has a dark and dangerous mind, and I mean that in a good way.  Pair of Jacks is a terrific book - it has a novel story line, interesting characters, humor, drama, and the plot is well-constructed and full of surprises. &lt;br&gt;
