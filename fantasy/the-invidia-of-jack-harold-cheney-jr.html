  <title>The Invidia of Jack - Harold Cheney  Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Deep in the heart of Eastshire there is a valley. Whatever name might be given to it in the proper geographies, it is know to most, if not all, of the people of the Shire as The Dark Valley.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This Dark Valley is located in the most remote district of Eastshire. It is sparsely populated. Indeed the population consists of but a handful of families. These families have lived apart from the other people of Eastshire for uncounted generations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The same isolation holds for the cats who live there. And it is the cats  and one special cat  of the Dark Valley that constitute the very heart of this story. This particular cat proves to be The Invidia of Jack of Tabbyshire.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To the ancients  the Greeks and Romans  the Invidia held a special place, somewhat akin to the better-known Nemesis. But, where the Nemesis is the agent of the gods in fighting Hubris and enforcing Justice, Invidia embodies the Envy and Jealousy that evidences itself in a dog in the manger or what is yours should have been mine attitude and life style.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And Jack does have his Invidia.&lt;/br&gt; 
In this tale he will encounter his Invidia.&lt;/br&gt;
How will he counter his Invidia?&lt;/br&gt; 
Can he?&lt;/br&gt; 
Or, will he need some help  help from an unexpected source?&lt;/br&gt; 
This tale recounts this final mission of our Lord Jack of Tabbyshire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
