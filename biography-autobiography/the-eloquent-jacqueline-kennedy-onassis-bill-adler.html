  <title>The Eloquent Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis - Bill Adler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As her own words prove well, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis could be at times funny, buoyant, candid, irreverent, and of course poignant, too. This collection of quotes shares her thoughts on marriage, family, political life and ambition, publicity, privacy, and more as she confided them to intimate friends, family, and interviewers alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memories of her childhood, her love for Jack, her children and grandchildren, the Kennedys, her often misunderstood marriage to Aristotle Onassis, her years as a widow, and her later companionship with Maurice Tempelsman are all represented here, as are some rather remarkable correspondences with the Johnsons, the Nixons, and the Khrushchevs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sampling of her wit and wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;&quot;I was a tomboy. I decided to learn to dance and I became feminine.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Well, I think my biggest achievement is that, after going through a rather difficult time, I consider myself comparatively sane.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When Harvard men say they have graduated from Radcliffe, then we&#39;ve made it.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If Jack proved to be the greatest president of the century and his children turned out badly, it would be a tragedy.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty years ago, when the nation was coming out from under a period of mourning, Bill Adler edited &lt;em&gt;The Kennedy Wit&lt;/em&gt; and in so doing helped the world remember a man and a president, not just a sorrowful event. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&#39;s death, he has edited yet another book of quotes celebrating life -- this time the life of Jackie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accompanying DVD documentary is considered by many to be the definitive film biography of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and was produced by CBS News Productions for Arts &amp;#38; Entertainment Network.&lt;/p&gt;" />
