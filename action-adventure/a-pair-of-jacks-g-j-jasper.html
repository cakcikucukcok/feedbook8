  <title>A Pair of Jacks - G.J. Jasper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amid the fury and hatred that followed the Civil War, a man was lucky to have one good friend.  Texas Jack Vermillion and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson were two such friends
Jack Walton Vermillion, at a very young age worked on the Clem Johnson ranch in West Texas where he almost became one of the family.  He was given the nickname of Texas Jack by the old cattleman Charlie Goodnight. Jack was later known as SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT JACK!
Jack Johnson also received his nickname, TURKEY CREEK JACK JOHNSON from Charlie Goodnight because his ranch was in the small town of Turkey Creek, Texas, just a few miles south of Fort Worth.  
This story tells about their adventures and how two young men became seasoned cowboys on their first trail drive. They learn what it means to ride for the brand, how loyalty to your fellow cowboys can mean the difference between life and a brutal death on the plains.
The author expresses his gratitude for the help and efforts of the following:
