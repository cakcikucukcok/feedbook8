The burden of greatness falls early on eldest son Montgomery, a handsome and successful politician who has never recovered from the horrors and heartbreak of the Great War. His younger siblings Ramsey and Lance, known as the &amp;#8220;infernal twins,&amp;#8221; are rivals not only in wit and beauty, but in their utter carelessness with the lives and hearts of others. Their brother Harold, as gentle and caring as the twins can be cruel, is slowed by a mental disability&amp;#8212;and later generations seem equally plagued by misfortune, forcing Houghton to seriously consider who should control the company after he&amp;#8217;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An irresistible tour de force of original storytelling, &lt;em&gt;American Pop&lt;/em&gt; blends fact and fiction, the mundane and the mythical, and utilizes techniques of historical reportage to capture how, in Nathaniel Hawthorne&amp;#8217;s words, &amp;#8220;families are always rising and falling in America,&amp;#8221; and to explore the many ways in which nostalgia can manipulate cultural memory&amp;#8212;and the stories we choose to tell about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
