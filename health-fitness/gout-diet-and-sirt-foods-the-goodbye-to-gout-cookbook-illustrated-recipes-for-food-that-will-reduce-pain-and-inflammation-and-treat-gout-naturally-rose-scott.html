  <title>Gout Diet and Sirt Foods: The Goodbye to Gout Cookbook Illustrated Recipes for Food That Will Reduce Pain and Inflammation and Treat Gout Naturally - Rose Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When it comes to gout and inflammation you really are what you eat. If you are looking for a natural, simple and straightforward way to treat gout and inflammation this cookbook is for you. Fully illustrated, it is packed full of colourful, tasty recipes that will help you make the switch from the food that causes gout to the food that will restore you body&#39;s natural balance and set you on the road to recovery and Sirt Foods are the key. For hundreds of years Sirt Foods in the form of seasonal vegetables, pulses and fruit were our staple diet. Now, for many of us, vegetables have fallen off of the menu and for some they have vanished completely. For most people the thought of &#39;giving up meat for gout&#39; and &#39;going semi vegetarian&#39; does not fill them with enthusiasm. Well this cookbook will show you that &#39;demi-veg&#39; food is nowhere near as bad as you think, in fact it is food that you and the whole family will enjoy." />
