  <title>An Irish Country Practice - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Practice&lt;/i&gt; is the twelfth heartwarming installment in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Patrick Taylor&#39;s beloved Irish Country series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, not too long ago, there was just a single Irish country doctor tending to the lively little village of Ballybucklebo: Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#39;Reilly. Now his thriving practice is growing by leaps and bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only has O&#39;Reilly taken a new trainee under his wing, Doctor Connor Nelson, he&#39;s also added a spirited Labrador puppy to his ever-expanding household at Number One Main Street. Meanwhile, his trusted partner, young Doctor Barry Laverty, finds himself wondering if he&#39;s truly ready to settle down and start a family with his lovely fiancée, Sue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the doctors cope with domestic and professional challenges, they also look after their patients and their ailments, including a mysterious cough, a housewife whose frequent &quot;accidents&quot; may have a disturbing cause, and a respected colleague who might be succumbing to an old vice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All is not sickness and worry, however. There&#39;s plenty of joy and merriment to be found as well, from a visiting circus to racing to sailing . . . and maybe even a happy ending or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
