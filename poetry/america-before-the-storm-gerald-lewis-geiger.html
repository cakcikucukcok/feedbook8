  <title>America, Before the Storm - Gerald Lewis Geiger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AMERICA, BEFORE THE STORM  Portrait of a Nation&lt;br&gt;
By Gerald Lewis Geiger (Copyright 2005)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a collection of poems in rhythmic and rhymed verse, about America, her place in Atlantica and the World, and a Time in Our Age that brought out the best in us.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We all are gathered and accounted for in this company the mighty and the not-so, the many and the few; all those who serve and those who only stand and wait. All of us are rich and fortified because of it, foras the Ancients had itpoetry is music of the spirit without the notes!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Poetry is lovepure and straight and steadyfor it nourishes that by which we live with food not otherwise obtainable. Poetry will lilt the soul through days and years of choring, searching, grasping, through fortune and calamity and leave us better, nobler beings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
AMERICA, BEFORE THE STORM  Portrait of a Nation starts with the 9/11 bang that jolted us and US awake. Against the background of our national hurt and anger, the work marshals our spirit and braces our resolve. It reaches back to trials past and glories gained. It proclaims our case and spotlights our feats that make so many throughout the world seek our land and ways.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
AMERICA, BEFORE THE STORM - Portrait of a Nation, by Gerald Lewis Geiger, tellsin lyrical languageof an Honor Roll, writ in sweat and blood, spelled out by the genius and guts of a people, young yet wise enough to build and plant and nurture generations.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It sends a hearty Hello! to all the generations, including the X-ers, who built this magnificent House and Home America! 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We all are there, and what we did and do and plan; deeds are recorded, fairly marked; due credit is awarded.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Somewho should know better-rattle on and on about this-that-the-other-thing they disapprove of in America. But then they copiously copy us! Such flattry in their imitation of our course!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the epic poem The First Day of Forever, the author honors America. He shows us whats at stake and calmly tells us that its we!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author brings our priceless Classic genre into Modern Times with A Prince for All Time the humanly elegant tale of a search for a new home to strike roots, certainly a timely topic in our Age of Mass Worldwide Migrations, what with people crossing land and sea frontiers, settling far from place of birth, to build a career and raise a family.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He pays tribute to the martyred artists of the Prague Spring and Maos Hundred Flowersboth of which shook a caring humankind with A Thousand Flowers Died.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And he asks the abyssal question of All Ages: Who art Thou, Man? Whence came you, Man? And whither goest Thou? His answer is so obvious and, yet, so profound.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book puts Americas wars in perspective in Roll Call of Liberty to highlight our gains and sacrifices as we sail in Harms Way again.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Full faith and credit is given to Atlantica, the fertile furrow for seeds of human genius, and to The Atlantic Family, the composite catalyst of human progress, the historical marriage of the best from West and East and North and South.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
POWER POETRY FOR THE PEOPLE  A poem a day keeps the blues away!&lt;br&gt;
This is THEME Poetry&lt;br&gt;
and the Theme is AMERICA,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the Core of the American Idea&lt;br&gt;
the Promise of the American Ideal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is To the People Poetry&lt;br&gt;
It SOUNDS OFF in the clearwithout a dozen footnotes on each page.&lt;br&gt;
It LILTS the routine pace of life along.&lt;br&gt;
It LIFTS the burdened spirit.&lt;br&gt;
It LOFTS our thoughts and dreams.&lt;br&gt;
It BOOSTS the Will to Win.&lt;br&gt;
It SPARKS the Imagination.&lt;br&gt;
It SUMMONS the Ingenuity.&lt;br&gt;
It BRACES the Sinew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A constant call to the Heart and Reason of Americans as America once again sails in Harms Way.
