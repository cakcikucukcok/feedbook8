  <title>A Mother&#39;s Transformation - Lori Madelline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A mother makes what she thinks is a mistake. Little does she know it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best things to ever happen to her! One small encounter opens up her mind, and her body follows. She and her son become one again, and both realize they have tapped into something bigger than the both of them. Rules are set, and passion explodes as they explore their new life together.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
After about a half hour just relaxing and enjoying their ecstatic state, Lori said, &amp;ldquo;Okay, now I think we really have to talk about this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sure, Mom&amp;hellip;you want to go first?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; She took a deep breath. &amp;ldquo;Number one&amp;hellip; No one, I mean &lt;i&gt;no one&lt;/i&gt;, can ever know. We can get into so much trouble. It&amp;rsquo;s illegal even though you&amp;rsquo;re an adult. If this ever gets out, we could both go to jail, not to mention we&amp;rsquo;d be ruined. I&amp;rsquo;d get fired; our lives would be in shambles. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the family. No way could I ever explain what we just did to them. Agreed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded. &amp;ldquo;What you and I do is no one else&amp;rsquo;s business. No one needs to know, and no one will ever know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
His wholehearted agreement eased her nerves some. &amp;ldquo;Number two&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m still your mother, and you will still show me the same respect as always. Our relationship has to change. I liked you being a little in control in bed, but at the end of the day I&amp;rsquo;m still your mother. As long as you live under my roof, it&amp;rsquo;s still my rules&amp;hellip;understand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I understand,&amp;rdquo; he said, but not very convincingly.&lt;br /&gt;
She shot him a quick look. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nothing. I agree,&amp;rdquo; he said quickly. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll just expand on it when you&amp;rsquo;re done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
That seemed fair enough. &amp;ldquo;Number three,&amp;rdquo; she continued, &amp;ldquo;if you want to be with me, then you&amp;rsquo;ll only be with me. I don&amp;rsquo;t want you banging all your college hotties, then coming back home and thinking you can do me, too. Got it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He grinned. &amp;ldquo;Not an issue, Mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
So far, they were on the same page. Encouraged, she held up four fingers. &amp;ldquo;Number four, and this goes back to number one. When we&amp;rsquo;re in public, we&amp;rsquo;re a normal mother and son. No touching, no talking sex, and especially no kissing&amp;hellip;got it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;One hundred percent, Mom.&amp;rdquo; He sounded amused.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;When we&amp;rsquo;re alone at home, it&amp;rsquo;s a totally different situation. You&amp;rsquo;re allowed to touch me, kiss me, whatever we decide,&amp;rdquo; she smiled.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You have no idea how long I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to hear that!&amp;rdquo; He emphasized that by rolling over and giving her a deep passionate kiss.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about,&amp;rdquo; she joked. &amp;ldquo;Okay, that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve got for now. Your turn, Jack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded, and took a deep breath of his own. &amp;ldquo;One rule I&amp;rsquo;d like to have is, we tell each other everything. I want to know all about you, Mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; she smiled. &amp;ldquo;If you really want to know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Number two?&amp;rsquo; He mimicked her by raising his fingers. &amp;ldquo;I want to be with you. Not just sex. I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be just a quick lay here and there when we&amp;rsquo;re horny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She eyed him thoughtfully. &amp;ldquo;Go on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I want you to be like my girlfriend, too,&amp;rdquo; he clarified. &amp;ldquo;I know you&amp;rsquo;re my mother, and I&amp;rsquo;ll always respect that. But I want to get to a point where we&amp;rsquo;re partners, too.&amp;rdquo; He offered her a shy smile. &amp;ldquo;A real couple.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She had to think about that for a few moments. &amp;ldquo;I think that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of pressure to put on us,&amp;rdquo; she finally murmured, &amp;ldquo;but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give it a try. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be easy. I still see you as my son. Even when we made love, I saw you as my son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And I saw you as my mother, but we could be so much more!&amp;rdquo; he insisted. &amp;ldquo;Mother and son, lovers, and life partners.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
That shook her a little. &amp;ldquo;Honey, I think it&amp;rsquo;s great you want to be with me. I really do. But you&amp;rsquo;re nineteen! You have your whole life ahead of you. Why do you want to be stuck with your mother? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hold you back in life!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then don&amp;rsquo;t hold me back, Mom&amp;hellip;be by my side.&amp;rdquo;" />
