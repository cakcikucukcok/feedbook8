  <title>Eve’S Sisters - Jayne P. Bowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this compilation of essays demonstrating the application of psychological and spiritual principles to the women of the Bible, the reader will soon see the similarities between the lives of Biblical women and those of today. Just like 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century Eves, some are wise, brave, and faithful, and others are conniving, imprudent, and downright disagreeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then and now, women struggle with emotions, relationships, and personal choice as they navigate their way through life. Eve and her sisters felt apprehension, jealously, and self-doubt. And like us, many squared their shoulders and faced their fears head on. With its themes of love, faith, individuality, and fulfillment, the Bible can actually be seen as a self-help book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dont underestimate the power of these women who lived generations ago to reach across time and culture to touch our lives. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A semi-retired educator with a background in psychology, Jayne is the author of four blogs and has published articles/stories in &lt;em&gt;Guideposts, The Petigru Review&lt;/em&gt;, and two LDS magazines, the &lt;em&gt;Liahona &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Ensign&lt;/em&gt;. She has also written two books, &lt;em&gt;Human Relations in Industry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Musings of a Missionary Mom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
