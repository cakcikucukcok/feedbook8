  <title>The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years: From The Next Generation to J. J. Abrams - Edward Gross, Mark A. Altman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the true story behind the making of a television legend. There have been many books written about &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;, but never with the unprecedented access, insight and candor of authors Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross. Having covered the franchise for over three decades, they&#39;ve assembled the ultimate guide to a television classic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fifty-Year Mission: Volume Two&lt;/i&gt; is an incisive, no-holds-barred oral history telling the story of post-Original Series &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;, told exclusively by the people who were there, in their own words--sharing the inside scoop they&#39;ve never told before--unveiling the oftentimes shocking true story of the history of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; and chronicling the trials, tribulations--and tribbles--that have remained deeply buried secrets... until now.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fifty-Year Mission: Volume Two&lt;/i&gt; includes the voices of hundreds television and film executives, programmers, writers, creators, and cast, who span from the beloved The Next Generation and subsequent films through its spin-offs: Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise, as well J.J. Abrams&#39; reimagined film series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
