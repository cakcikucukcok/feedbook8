  <title>Swan for the Money - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The brilliantly funny and talented Donna Andrews delivers another winner in the acclaimed avian-themed mystery series readers have come to love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg Langslow&#39;s eccentric parents have a new hobby: growing roses and entering them in highly competitive shows. Dad&#39;s gardening skill and Mother&#39;s gift for selecting and arranging the blossoms should make them an unbeatable team---and Meg is relieved they&#39;ve taken up such a safe, gentle hobby. She even volunteers to help when the Caerphilly Garden Club sponsors its first annual rose show. But after a few hours of dealing with her parents&#39; competitors, Meg is worried. Rose growers are so eccentric that they make Meg&#39;s family seem almost normal, and so competitive that they will do nearly anything to take home the show&#39;s grand prize---making them prime suspects when Meg discovers that someone is attempting to kill the wealthy woman on whose estate the competition is being held. Of course, the intended victim had other enemies---her treatment of her farm animals had aroused the interest of several animal welfare activists, including Meg&#39;s zoologist grandfather. Meg tries to leave the detecting to the local police and focus on protecting her parents&#39; chances to win the coveted Black Swan trophy, but she soon finds herself compelled to solve the crime before any more rose growers die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Swan for the Money&lt;/i&gt;, two for the show, three to get ready... now go, Meg, go!&lt;/p&gt;" />
