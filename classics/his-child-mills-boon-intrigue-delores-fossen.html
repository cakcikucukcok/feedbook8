          &lt;strong&gt;After being abducted and artificially inseminated, Jessie Barrett was in danger and running for her life. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the one man she could turn to for answers was Jake McClendon - the biological father of her unborn child. In the midst of their clandestine investigation to uncover the conspiracy behind her kidnapping, Jessie was unwittingly drawn to the sexy Texas rancher.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She knew she should keep her distance and safeguard her heart, but all she wanted was to kiss him senseless. Except when he insisted they pretend to be man and wife so he could protect her, her defenses started to crumble. Now the ultimate challenge was to keep from falling in love with the father of her baby!&lt;/p&gt;
