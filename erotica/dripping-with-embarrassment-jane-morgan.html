  <title>Dripping With Embarrassment - Jane Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Dripping with Embarrassment is a short story of a young female office clerk who hates her boss seemingly, until he makes a statement that gets her mind to wandering. At the same time, the statement excites her and makes her fantasize about what he may have actually meant by the comment. Then after trying to entice him, his forgetfulness disappoints her. The day for her drags on until she makes a mistake and takes a file to him by accident.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Passion overtook me and I began masturbating to the thought of him smacking my ass as hard as he could while he told me what a bad little girl I was. My fingers slid into my opening gently and began fingering me without a second thought. With each smack to my cheek, my fingers dove in and out of me feverishly." />
