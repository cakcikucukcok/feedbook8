  <title>Communicating Pregnancy Loss - Rachel Silverman, Jay Baglia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the &lt;B&gt;Winner of the OSCLG Outstanding Book Award&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The loss of a desired pregnancy or the inability to experience pregnancy are intensely personal phenomena; these losses are also, in our culture at least, extremely private. &lt;I&gt;Communicating Pregnancy Loss&lt;/I&gt; is a collection of first-person narratives about the experience of pregnancy loss. Although there is no shortage of books that help prospective parents cope with an unintended pregnancy loss or ‘survive’ infertility, most of these books are authored by physicians or therapists and address pregnancy loss through the language of guidance. This book is different. It is the first of its kind because the contributors (primarily communication scholars but also healthcare personnel and other scholars from the social sciences) tell their story of loss in their own words, offering a diverse collection of narratives that span experience and identity. The authors employ various feminist theories, narrative theories, and performance theories as well as other well-known communication theories and concepts. The book’s narrative approach to writing about and thereby understanding pregnancy loss offers readers a method for changing the way pregnancy loss is understood personally, culturally, and politically." />
