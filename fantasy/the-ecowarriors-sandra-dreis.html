      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, a writer makes a first appearance on the literature scene and the reader feels the excitement of meeting a new friend. In her debut novel, The Ecowarriors, Sandra Dreis creates young characters with voices that ring true and a story that is perfectly timed to entertain. Setting the fantasy against the background of the all-too-real problem of fracking is nothing short of brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

With the powers given to them by the badgers, the four youths must defeat an evil force that will rise from Devils Lake on the eve of the Winter Solstice .
Suddenly, vacation plans morph from the ordinary to the fantastic as the four experience a daring cross-country ski excursion, uncover clues from petroglyphs on a cave exploration, and survive a bizarre ice-fishing adventure. Will they be able to put these clues together in time? 
In the background, Grandpa John, a retired geologist, and his old friend, Avery, an Ojibwa storyteller, play important roles. As the young eco-warriors find themselves with the ability to fly, they face the enemy at Devils Doorway, a landmark rock formation high up on the dangerous cliffs over the lake. Battling the forces of a giant sand monster, the teenagers will discover the truths that lienot only below the surface of the Devils Lakebut within themselves. &lt;/p&gt;" />
