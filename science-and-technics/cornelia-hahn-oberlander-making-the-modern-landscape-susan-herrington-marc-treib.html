  <title>Cornelia Hahn Oberlander: Making the Modern Landscape - Susan Herrington, Marc Treib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornelia Hahn Oberlander is one of the most important landscape     architects of the twentieth century, yet despite her lasting influence, few outside the field     know her name. Her work has been instrumental in the development of the late-twentieth-century     design ethic, and her early years working with architectural luminaries such as Louis Kahn and     Dan Kiley prepared her to bring a truly modern-and audaciously abstract-sensibility to the     landscape design tradition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;In Cornelia Hahn Oberlander: Making the     Modern Landscape,&lt;/i&gt; Susan Herrington draws upon archival research, site analyses, and     numerous interviews with Oberlander and her collaborators to offer the first biography of this     adventurous and influential landscape architect. Born in 1921, Oberlander fled Nazi Germany at     the age of eighteen with her family, going on to become one of the few women to graduate from     Harvard University&#39;s Graduate School of Design in the late 1940s. For six decades she has     practiced socially responsible and ecologically sensitive planning for public landscapes,     including the 1970s design of the Robson Square landscape and its adjoining Provincial Law     Courts-one of Vancouver&#39;s most famous spaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herrington places     Oberlander within a larger social and aesthetic context, chronicling both her personal and     professional trajectory and her work in New York, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Seattle, Berlin,     Toronto, and Montreal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oberlander is a progenitor of some of the most     significant currents informing landscape architecture today, particularly in the area of     ecological focus. In her thorough biography, Herrington draws much-deserved attention to one of     the truly important figures in landscape architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
