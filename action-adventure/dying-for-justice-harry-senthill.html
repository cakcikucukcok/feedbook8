  <title>Dying For Justice - Harry Senthill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dying For Justice &lt;/em&gt;is a novel -- an adventure story driven by a miscarriage of justice and one man&amp;#39;s way of dealing with it. It turns out sometimes righting a wrong can be murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead character, Ed Somersby, is just an ordinary young man. He has a responsible job, a mortgage and a live-together girlfriend. He&amp;#39;s a nice guy and people naturally like him. The only thing that sets him harmlessly apart is that he&amp;#39;s got long hair, a beard, and rides a motorcycle. All that changes when his girlfriend is killed in a road accident, and the driver who was responsible is let off by the courts. Angry and bitter, Somersby stalks the driver, unaware the driver&amp;#39;s father is a wealthy London gangster. Father and son react aggressively to Somersby&amp;#39;s activities, the situation rapidly escalates, and Somersby finds himself under sentence of death. As the conflict unfolds, Somersby is frequently guilt-ridden, sometimes depressed, sometimes elated, and occasionally terrified. He survives several attempts to kill him, more by luck than skill. But he also learns how to fight back, matching violence with violence. Supporting him, and eventually helping him to escape from his nightmare situation are two women: a kind, gentle, intelligent law studen twho falls in love with him, and a supermarket manageress whose no-nonsense mental toughness makes her a priceless ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to read&amp;nbsp; a story about someone who isn&amp;#39;t a supremely competent, conscience-free killing machine but is instead much closer to people you know, or the person you are, told (as if) by the character himself, and without the use of F-words, this book will provide a few hours of believable escapism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
