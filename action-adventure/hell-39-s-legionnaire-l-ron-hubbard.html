  <title>Hell&#39;s Legionnaire - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;American Ann Halliday is as sexy as Rita Hayworth and as fiery as the  Sahara sun. And now she&amp;rsquo;s feeling some real heat, as the prize captive  of the Berber known as &amp;ldquo;The Killer.&amp;rdquo; But Dusty Colton, an American  deserter from the French Foreign Legion, has all the swagger of Robert  Mitchum&amp;mdash;and he has a different idea. Can they team up and turn evil on  its head?&amp;#160; One thing&amp;rsquo;s for sure&amp;mdash;between Ann and the Hell&amp;rsquo;s Legionnaire,  the temperature is about to get even hotter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;On the subject of North Africa,  Hubbard said that writers too often &amp;ldquo;forget a great deal of the  languorous quality which made the Arabian Nights so pleasing. Jewels,  beautiful women, towering cities filled with mysterious shadows, sultans  equally handy with robes of honor and the beheading sword.&amp;rdquo; Hubbard  brings this unique insight to his stories of North Africa and the  Legionnaires, investing them with an authenticity of time, place and  character that will keep you asking for more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also  includes the adventure stories, The Barbarians, in which a Legionnaire  sets out to avenge a savage killing and makes a stunning discovery, and  The Squad That Never Came Back, the story of a man who has uncovered the  secret to a city of gold&amp;mdash;a secret that could turn into a death  sentence.&amp;#160; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&amp;ldquo;Action-packed . . . standout . . . hard-core graphic.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&amp;mdash;Library Journal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
