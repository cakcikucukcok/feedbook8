  <title>The Senator - Dr. Carl R. Stekelenburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Officer Robert Williams gets his Masters Degree in Criminal Justice and is quickly promoted from road duties to command duties with a rank of Captain. He is placed in command of the Waycross, Georgia patrol post. 
	His assistant is Ron Astro. Rons wife is Dr. Linda Astro, professor of political science at Waycross College. Governor Nathan Deal had the responsibility of appointing a new U.S. Senator upon the death by heart attack of the existing junior senator. Officers Ron and Robert had both performed courteous service for the governor and his protection detail on his visits to Waycross. The previous year they and their wives, Dr. Linda and Penny, had attended a governors ball and fundraising dinner at Waycross College. The governor had been impressed with both couples. He was particularly impressed with the economic and political understanding of both Dr. Linda and Robert. 
	When the junior senator died of a heart attack, the governor, already acquainted with Dr. Linda Astro, quickly appointed her to fill the remaining term of that senator as provided by state law. Linda quickly accepted, but didnt mention she was three weeks pregnant. Off to Washington D.C. she went. She represented Georgia quite well, but the child continued to grow within her. Soon she was forced to seek maternity leave. Governor Deal had to appoint someone on a temporary basis while Dr. Linda was in the hospital. This was just too important a time for Georgia not to have two senators in Washington. President Obama was pushing for an increase in the debt ceiling for the current budget year of 2011. He had already shoved down Georgias throat the Obama health care plan. Governor Deal immediately thought of Officer Williams to fill the post temporarily while Dr. Linda was in the hospital.
	Officer Williams requested and was granted extended leave without pay to temporarily become a U.S. Senator. 
	This book is his story." />
