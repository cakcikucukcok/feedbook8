  <title>Switch It Up - Corinne Trang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Imagine food that can be made ahead of time for convenience, then mixed and matched to create colorful perfectly portioned meals that are both healthful and flavorful. &lt;I&gt;Switch It Up&lt;/I&gt; lets you discover how the concept of compartmentalizing can help you prepare balanced meals for every day of the week. This book includes 50 nutritious and delicious, quick and simple recipes that can be combined in any number of ways. Each recipe is made up of readily available ingredients. Learn how to pair different flavors and textures while developing a palate for healthful food combinations. Healthy eating starts with understanding balance. For instance, in Asian cultures, the majority of the meal is made up of vegetables, with much less animal or seafood protein than we are used to in the West. Indeed, anything with legs or fins is generally considered a flavor enhancer rather than the main course. Additionally, the reader can decide to enjoy &amp;#147;Raw Kale with Roasted Sweet Potato Salad&amp;#8221; as a full meal or as a part of a meal, if they want to pair the salad with other foods, for example. Lastly, desserts are largely absent, fresh fruit or a simple cup of hot tea or herbal infusion is encouraged at the end of the meal to aid digestion.&lt;/div&gt;" />
