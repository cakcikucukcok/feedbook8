  <title>Always, Yes Always, Expect Miracles! - Kassie Wright, Ellen Van Laar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many of us simply don&#39;t have time in our busy lifestyles for anything spiritual. We don&#39;t set aside &#39;me&#39; times. Often we skip reading &#39;Inspirational&#39; stuff because we rationalize that we have more important things to do. I was one of those people. This was one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too busy to read any self-help or inspirational stuff, let alone &#39;Law of Attraction&#39; books. I thought I was above that. I didn&#39;t need self-help. At least, not until Miracles started to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things seem to be as bad as they can be, if we look within, we all can discover &#39;The Power&#39;. Each one of us has it. It exists within us all. It&#39;s love. And when we become aware and conscious, we can feel the energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use this energy to guide us through our life. To find happiness and peace. The Power doesn&#39;t exist outside. It lives within our hearts. Understand the Universal Laws and use them to design the life of your dreams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set yourself up to receive everything you always wanted in life. Once you begin to see the light, you&#39;ll never go back to darkness. Surround yourself with positive people. And remember, you &#39;get what you give&#39;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And always, yes always, EXPECT Miracles! &lt;/p&gt;" />
