  <title>The Detective&#39;s Garden - Janyce Stefan-Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Detective&amp;#8217;s Garden&lt;/I&gt;: A Love Story and Meditation on Murder is set in Brooklyn in 1995. Originally from Slovenia, ex-NYPD Homicide Detective Emil Milosec, a man with a past poised to reclaim him is perennially on the outside.  Elena, his beauty of a wife, has died, but she has filled pages of letters to him&amp;#151;which he has so far refused to read. Elena always remained elusive to him, and she still is.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An ugly discovery among the leafy haven of their backyard garden unsettles the uneasy truce Emil has managed since Elena&amp;#8217;s death. A lively cast of local characters, a dark history and an international mystery all inform the story. Underpinning events are a heat wave, the Brooklyn housing bubble underway, a gun that goes off, and a smattering of science. A little bit Sophocles, a dash of Shakespeare, and tablespoons of Old Testament go into a brew that is both contemplative and neo-noirish.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
