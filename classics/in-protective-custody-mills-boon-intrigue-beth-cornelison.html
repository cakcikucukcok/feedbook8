      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;TWO STRANGERS AND A BABY…. ONE INTENSE ROAD TRIP.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Firefighter Max Caldwell promised to care for his sister&#39;s newborn son, but he didn&#39;t know the first thing about babies. He had to learn fast, especially with ruthless drug smugglers, who wanted control of their &quot;heir,&quot; chasing them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After witnessing a fender-bender, day-care worker Laura Dalton was wary of the baby-toting driver claiming &quot;Elmer&quot; as his son. A woman on a mission, she jumped into his car for the ride of a lifetime. Her noble efforts were to protect the child, but she didn&#39;t bargain on a lethal attraction to Max. Could this makeshift family be exactly what she&#39;d always wanted?&lt;/p&gt;
