While away on a business trip, Arelis mother is murdered only a month before his fifteenth birthday. Alone in the world now and with very little to lose, Areli sets out on a dangerous quest to find her killers and bring them to justice. What he discovers alters not only his understanding of her murder but his understanding of reality and his place within it. &lt;/p&gt;
Before he knows it, he finds himself caught up in a timeless war between two supernatural factions that are threatening the worlds balance of power. Quite against his intentions, he is informed that he is now a part of this war, and his involvement goes much deeper than his mothers death. He finds himself forced into the heart of the action and required to step up and become the man he is destined to be. &lt;/p&gt;
Can he balance his new life in time to save his friends and familyand the worldfrom harm? &lt;/p&gt;" />
