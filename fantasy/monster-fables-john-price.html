  <title>Monster Fables - John Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Monster fables is a fairy tale story about a kindly wizard who lives in a castle and uses his magic to teach and help children who have various social and moral difficulties. It is a collection of 5 different stories, about an ice cream monster, a toy thief monster, a playground bully monster, a homeless, shy monster, and 3 class clown monsters. Each monster is actually a child that struggles with a problem related to the type of monster that they are transformed into. Near the end of the book, the wizard is revealed and his gift of a special magic potion that transforms each child is explained. The wizard&#39;s history and his personal life are explained also in the last section of the book. It was primarily influenced by Disney, and by experiences that I have had while babysitting for my sisters." />
