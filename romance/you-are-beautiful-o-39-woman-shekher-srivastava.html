  <title>You Are Beautiful O&#39;woman - Shekher Srivastava</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An ode to Wumanity . . .
Since billions of years ago, the woman has stood the testimony of time but has seldom been appreciated. She has, however, continued untiringly to fulfill her role as defined by God. As a mother, wife, and daughter, she has nurtured hope and been the quiet sentinel of mans ambitions. She has been mans beautiful companion, diligent and silent, helping him not only scale through difficult times, but at the same time, she has been his unwavering encouragement, applauding every milestone, big or small, that he has achieved, with positive enthusiasm.
In return, she has never yearned for any appreciation or praise. However, being human, she would be happy to receive reciprocal appreciation, even if they are two words of praise, but yet regardless, she has carried on serving man and God. 
In the backdrop of an interesting dialog between God and Arvind, the chosen one, finally, her day dawns, when God himself decides to showcase her as his most beautiful creation ever. What transpires between them over a long session is actually an ode to the woman. Its an acknowledgment by God of her efforts, in the words of Arvind.
God presents Arvind with various situations and prods him to respond. As each session ends, one by one, Arvind discovers the seven timeless virtues of the woman as pearls of her inner beauty. Arvind realizes that the inner beauty of a woman is the serenity of life in every home. He realizes that if the five elements of naturewater, air, sky, fire and earthare the truth of life, her Wumanity is the vibrant sixth element and is the truth of living. Without her, man would probably never have seen progression. She is the force that binds and the love that inspires!
As he reflects over each virtue, Arvind understands the spirit of a woman and why God created her. In the process, he discovers his love for the bubbly and vivacious Jayanti, his classmate, whom he had not met since leaving school. He now fervently wishes to find her and is convinced she is the right girl for him. 
Set in the framework of a light romance between Arvind and Jayanti, in flashback, it is an attempt to capture the woman, an embodiment of seven beautiful virtues as Gods most artful creation ever." />
