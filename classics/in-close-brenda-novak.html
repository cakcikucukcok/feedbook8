        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Claire O&#39;Toole&#39;s mother, Alana, went missing fifteen years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That was big news in Pineview, Montana, the kind of town where nothing much ever happens. Then, last year, Claire&#39;s husband, David, died in a freak accident—after launching his own investigation into Alana&#39;s disappearance. Is Alana dead? Or did she simply abandon her husband and daughters?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Claire is determined to find out—and her former boyfriend, Isaac Morgan, wants to help. Although their relationship didn&#39;t end well, he still has feelings for her. And yet it isn&#39;t until he starts to suspect David&#39;s death wasn&#39;t an accident that he&#39;s drawn back into her life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Together, Claire and Isaac search for answers to the questions that have haunted Pineview all this time. But as they soon discover, someone&#39;s prepared to kill so those answers won&#39;t be found…&lt;/p&gt;

The 1st was Inside, the 2nd was In Seconds.
