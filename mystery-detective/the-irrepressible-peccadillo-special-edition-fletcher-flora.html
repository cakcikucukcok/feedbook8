  <title>The Irrepressible Peccadillo: Special Edition - Fletcher Flora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The wayward beauty who comes back to her old hometown to titillate her ex-boyfriend (now a married lawyer) and to blackmail her ex-husband is ripe bait for murder. And murder is just what she gets. Suspicion falls heaviest on the old flame and not on the discarded husband -- for very obvious reasons. At the time of the lady&#39;s demise, the lawyer was out of his legal mind, befuddled by a number of those potent concoctions known around the cocktail table as gimlets. In the second place, he was squarely on the scene of the crime....  &lt;P&gt; Fortunately, his wife believes him. When her husband is carted off to jail, whe sets out to prove him innocent. &lt;P&gt; &quot;The Irrepressible Peccadillo&quot; is written with all Fletcher Flora&#39;s customary verve and sophistication. To the gripping story of a man on the spot, he adds plenty of wit, sex, and humor -- and comes up with a puzzle that will keep the reader guessing to the last page. This special bonus edition includes a classic short story by Fletcher Flora, &quot;The Invisible Gauntlet.&quot;" />
