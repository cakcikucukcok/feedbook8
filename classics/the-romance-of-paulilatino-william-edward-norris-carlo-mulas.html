  <title>The Romance of Paulilatino - William Edward Norris, Carlo Mulas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this Sardinian tale we are introduced to young Count Vincenzo, the son of a Sardinian landed proprietor of ancient lineage and miserly habits, who has spent twenty years of his twenty-five away from home, in the care of an uncle and aunt, from whom he has imbibed literary and artistic tastes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the death of his uncle, Vincenzo returns to a home that he scarcely remembers in the wild mountainous village of Paulilatino, Sardinia. Here, practically bereft of all society save that of an unsympathetic old father, he is miserable until he chances across a beautiful village maiden, Teresina, with aspirations that soar far above her rank.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, Vincenzo quickly falls in love, and being an honorable fellow he is drawn on so far as to promise to make the girl his wife: a promise that he means to keep. But there is another lover, a hot-blooded peasant named Paolo, to reckon with, whom Teresina keeps as a second string to her bow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terrible love, necessary blood and traditional vendetta for a classical &amp;ldquo;Sardinian tale&amp;rdquo; that introduces the reader to discover the amazing and picturesque island of Sardinia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel was published for the first time in The Cornhill Magazine in September 1883.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
