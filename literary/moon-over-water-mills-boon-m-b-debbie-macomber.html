  <title>Moon Over Water (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Debbie Macomber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy&#39; - &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Not long ago, the only adventures Lorraine Dancy experienced were in the movies–where the improbable becomes possible and the romantic becomes real. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now she&#39;s starring in her own version of Romancing the Stone–except that this is her life. Her adventure begins with a trip to Mexico&#39;s Yucatán coast to search for the father she doesn&#39;t remember. She finds him, all right. She also finds herself in trouble–framed for the theft of an artifact and pursued by the police, the thief and a local crime boss.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enter Jack Keller. Jack&#39;s a renegade who keeps to himself and makes his own rules. As a favor to Lorraine&#39;s father he helps her escape. In his boat. Just like The African Queen. But there are troubled waters ahead…including an attraction that&#39;s as risky as it is intense. Lorraine&#39;s not looking for another Brief Encounter, though. She wants her story to have a different ending altogether!&lt;/p&gt;
