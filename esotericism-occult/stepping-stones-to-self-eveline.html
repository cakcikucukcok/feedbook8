  <title>Stepping Stones to Self - Eveline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Due to current planetary alignments, our heart center is being flooded with Divine energies, inspiring us to heal our bodies and deal with emotional blocks. Now is the time to journey to the inner landscape and discover true Self. Stepping Stones 2Self is a collection of articles aimed to enhance the understanding of the body/mind/spirit connection, while learning to honor and nourish the Self. &lt;br&gt;
In understanding Self, we are able to understand others, and create a more peaceful environment. &lt;p&gt;
The rare gift of eveline is more than explaining complicated issues in a clear and simple way. She is passionately involved in all her subjects, lives them first and thus is able to pass her experience on to her readers. &lt;p&gt; 
Integrating intuition and knowledge from the Knowing Field into her writings, trusting her abilities to be in tune with Higher Knowledge, eveline is a medium through which essential information is given and passing this on to her readers is a true act of love. &lt;p&gt;
eveline&#39;s articles are deeply connected with the body, mind and spirit; exploring all three of them in a way that transcends our dogmatic view on these subjects. Using the ease of a true seer she shows us alternative paths to walk through life and ways to use our body, mind and spirit to become one with Self and thus with All That Is. ~ L.R." />
