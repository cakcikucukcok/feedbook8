  <title>San Juan: Glimpses in Time - Michael Jean Nystrom-Schut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;From my home in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;San Juan&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, a lovely sector of central Tibas, situated just north of &lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;San Jose&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, while the candle flickers I commence the writing of these varied glimpses. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Warning! What you are about to read are personal memoirs! They are much to do about self. They amount to a large group of random thoughts, sporadic observations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;I always feel I am somehow supposed to write my thoughts down  what a big ego I must have  because (I like to think that) if you put them all together, they form a loose-knit way of seeing the world. They are a part of my worldview. Everyone has one of these  whats your view of the world look like? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;I am going to be a world philosopher when I grow up, you see. That is what my intention is, since I have always been preoccupied with how to see things, how to process things. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;How odd is life anyway. Thats why my interest in philosophy  to figure out the oddness of life. Normally, I think philosophy can be pretty dry and boring. But, for me, its terribly exciting. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;In this book, what you are about to delve into will resemble the form of an ongoing story. It will consist of a sequence of six weeks of shadows and lights (i.e. days and nights). After that time, wherever I am at with it, I will stop, and simply and abruptly start to write another book about something else I know not what.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Here though, I will (I suspect) be sharing with you a series of ideas, dreams, fears, logical thoughts, illogical thoughts, wonderings, wanderings and general psychobabble. I say that because I intend to impart thoughts and ideas about whatever might be in my ongoing existence in being. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;This could be anything, I assure youas of course it could be for anyone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Exactly what will appear in the pages that represent the next six weeks of my life, I do not have any idea  that, for me, is going to be much of the fun of writing it!&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
