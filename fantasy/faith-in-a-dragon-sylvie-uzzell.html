  <title>Faith in a Dragon - Sylvie Uzzell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A small North Carolina mountain community is shocked when renowned bluegrass singer, Angel Bernard, is found murdered in her home. An unseasonably cold rain begins to fall that night.
Fiona, Angels teenage daughter and a gifted artist, falls into despair as her father withdraws. Fionas only comfort is her grandmother, Rose. Unfortunately, Rose must travel for a few days, leaving Fiona alone with her alcoholic father. Before she departs, she asks Fiona to complete her latest painting and gives her a ruby necklace along with an incredible story that it was given to her grandmother by a unicorn.
On the night before Roses return, Fiona decides to honor her grandmothers wish and finish the painting. Around midnight, she grows sleepy and goes to bed, when suddenly she awakes, feeling quite cold. She looks out the window and sees that snow has replaced the rain, so she decides to paint a while longer. Fionas life takes a surprising turn when she is suddenly sucked through her painting, landing in another world. 
Leollyn, teenage daughter of a local dairy farmer (Averi), discovers Fiona asleep on the hot dusty path in her world: the LoherLans. Leollyns world, threatened by scorching heat, is on the verge of total destruction. The young elf takes a dazed Fiona home to her parents, who, having anticipated their arrival, impart words of an age-old prophecy to the girls. In the prophecy, Leollyn and Fiona are named as the chosen saviors of the universe; to save both worlds, the girls must embark on a quest to vanquish an evil force (Grimgorrah) and rescue a dragon: one of two dragons that balance the forces of nature. Averi also presents Leollyn with a beautiful blue jewel: the twin to the red gem Fiona wears.
Averi accompanies the girls through a secret underground tunnel system to safely deliver them into the hands of his lifelong friend, Mirgaynia, an immortal phaerie. In Mirgaynias home (Wood Haven), the girls gather more information about the prophecy. They learn, to their relief, that other creatures in the land have also been predestined to lend aid to the chosen heirs; thus unity is formed to defeat Grimgorrah and restore balance to the worlds.
Before they leave Wood Haven, Mirgaynia explains that each race in the land has a special gift, each possessing a unique ability essential to the quests success. Her gift is a magical mirror and a traveling companion: Jareth, a unicorn. The unity must secure the remaining gifts before they arrive in Fayor, the land where Grimgorrah has erected his fortress.
As they journey east, the girls meet an assortment of magical creatures (dwarves, wravens, sylphs, and merfolk) each with their own role to play in the fated quest. They witness hardship, near-death experiences, and feelings of defeat as the journey progresses and as their problems become more difficult to solve.
Fiona enters the LoherLans with only a paintbrush, a brass key, and a copper penny, unaware that each of these items has a unique function in this new world that is sizzling with magic. Leollyn takes with her on the journey an embroidered handkerchief, a hand-carved flute, and an intricately carved bird statue, each of which also plays a vital role if the quest is to succeed. 
Fiona ultimately discovers information about her ancestry and why she was named as the heir to the prophecy. Even armed with knowledge, she experiences doubt and hardship as she attempts to make sense of her new life, possibly a life in a new world without her family. 
Faith in a Dragon addresses a teenage girls struggle to accept her destiny and rely on her faith to survive. Will the girls persevere and return balance to both worlds? Will they be able to uphold their faith, fulfill their destinies? Will Fiona see her family again? The story ends with a twist and sets the scene for a sequel. The thrilling journey, filled with magic, suspense, and unexpected turns around every corner begins . . . in Faith in a Dragon." />
