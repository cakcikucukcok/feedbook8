  <title>Fourth Grave Beneath My Feet - Darynda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of grim reaper extraordinaire, Charley Davidson. Try as she might, there&#39;s no avoiding her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes being the grim reaper really is, well, &lt;i&gt;grim&lt;/i&gt;. And since Charley&#39;s last case went so awry, she has taken a couple of months off to wallow in the wonders of self-pity. But when a woman shows up on her doorstep convinced someone is trying to kill her, Charley has to force herself to rise above . . . or at least get dressed. It becomes clear something is amiss when everyone the woman knows swears she&#39;s insane. But the more they refute the woman&#39;s story, the more Charley believes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the sexy, sultry son of Satan, Reyes Farrow, is out of prison and out of Charley&#39;s life, as per her wishes and several perfectly timed death threats. But his absence has put a serious crimp in her sex life. While there are other things to consider, like the fact that the city of Albuquerque has been taken hostage by an arsonist, Charley is having a difficult time staying away. Especially when it looks like Reyes may be involved. &lt;br&gt;Just when life was returning to normal, Charley is thrust back into the world of crime, punishment, and the devil in blue jeans in this hilarious fourth installment in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series from Darynda Jones. .&lt;/p&gt;" />
