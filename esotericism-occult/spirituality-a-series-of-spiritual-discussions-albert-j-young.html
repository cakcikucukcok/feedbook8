  <title>Spirituality a Series of Spiritual Discussions - Albert J. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about Spirituality a book that starts off telling the story of a young boy who develops a very rare neurological disease that effects balance, coordination and is genetic, progressive, incurable, untreatable and can be fatal.
This book is not really about that though, it was necessary to explain and describe it because  it was an important part of the journey that led to a Spiritual Awakening and a deep Spiritual consciousness. 
This book is not a self help book, It is not written to imply that the author has reached a higher Spiritual place than anyone else or to convert anyone to his way of thinking. It isnt about a transformation from poor to rich, from sick to a cure or even a How to fix your life.
It is also a message to everyone that you don&#39;t need to be a  Spiritual guru, psychic, religious or considered gifted and so on, to be  Spiritual. I believe every single one of us are born a Spiritual being  A Spirit Experiencing a Temporary Human Experience.It is a book of Spiritual discussions on certain subjects  and experiences that have helped the author personally understand the world we live in.
Spirituality, is an awareness that you are much more than a body that we are a Spirit  experiencing a temporary human experience.
Our spiritual journey is an infinite journey experiencing many mortal incarnations and many realms. Our world is similar to a Spiritual university where we learn from  the many experiences and we try to address much of the confusion and clarify  as much as we can. Humans have complicated God.
We include a &quot;Quote&quot; at the end of each chapter which we consider thought  provoking and in some way appropriate to the chapter.It does not mean that the original author of the quote does." />
