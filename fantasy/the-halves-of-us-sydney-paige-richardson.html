  <title>The Halves of Us - Sydney Paige Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twin Sisters: one &lt;i&gt;destined&lt;/i&gt; to rule, one &lt;i&gt;cursed&lt;/i&gt; to destroy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some say blood is thicker than water. But for twin sisters, Adie and Aura, their connection runs even deeper than blood.&lt;br /&gt;
After investigating a surprise attack carried out by dark souls controlled by the Wicked Willow, an evil &amp;nbsp;residing in a neighboring region, Aura uncovers a family secret: she is the fulfillment of a curse placed upon her family centuries ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Aura is destined to destroy their planet, Thindoral, Adie is fated to follow in their mother&amp;rsquo;s footsteps and become Ruler, but even Adie&amp;rsquo;s path comes with revelations. Dangerous premonitions plague her dreams, all depicting Thindoral&amp;rsquo;s demise at the hand of her sister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As darkness takes control of her mind, Aura must determine whether defying fate and time is the choice that will seal her destruction, or if self-sacrifice will save all she holds dear. Meanwhile, Adie is faced with an impossible decision: save her sister, or protect their world?&lt;br /&gt;
