  <title>Night Runners - Rodger J. Bille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Jill Gardiner, an ambitious young woman from the 21st century, inexplicably wakes up in 1928 where her first contacts are two young boat builders who at once vie for her attention and affection. Steeling herself to not only survive, but take advantage of her new circumstances, she uses foreknowledge to manipulate the rising stock market into enough capital to allow her friends to build the rumrunner boat of their dreams. With a less than subtle nudge from a local garage owner-cum-bootlegger, they form a partnership that leads to more dangerous encounters than any of the unlikely foursome might dream in their worst nightmares. Running at night in their marvelous creation, the Ghost, they must contend with ferocious natural elements, elude Coast Guard patrols, fight off determined pirates and even one of their own clients. While her partners struggle to maintain difficult rendezvous, Jill, still connected to her computer, is being manipulated to complete the insane goal of the 21st century power broker who sent her back in time. Torn between loyalty and affection for both young men, she forms a plan to turn the tables on the evil conspirators and secure a future for her new friends. From the rocky shores of British Columbia to the infamous Chinese tunnels beneath Tacoma, Washington, danger and intrigue follow the Night Runner partners. This carefully crafted and historically correct adventure tale will have readers of all ages turning its pages into the wee hours as they vicariously live the life of the young rum-runners as they speed through the night in the Ghost, a truly marvelous Night Runner.
