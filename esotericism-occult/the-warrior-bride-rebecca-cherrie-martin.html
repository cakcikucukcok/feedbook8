  <title>The Warrior Bride - Rebecca Cherrie Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A practical testament to help expose spiritual identity theft for victims of Incest, Rape, Child Molestation and Domestic Violence. Your cries dont have to be silent any longer. Rebecca Cherrie Martin is an Evangelist who has touched the hearts and souls of many hurting men, women and children with her message of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Cherrie Martin is the founder of all five divisions of Teleo International LLC, an arts management and consulting company that assists in developing and empowering individuals as they become established entrepreneurs, writers and artists.

testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as the Passionate Playwright, Rebecca has taken Midwest audiences to a place where they visually see Gods glory, passion, power and His love through her live theater performances. Her approach is characterized by touching on the social, political, religious and historical issues within the community and family.
