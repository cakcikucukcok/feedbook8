  <title>Obsession - Selina Elliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tessa knew that she deserved the fate that had befallen her. The decision to run away from a father who hated her and a marriage she wanted no part of was entirely hers. Certainly the outcome was her responsibility. So why did she keep trying to escape her life? Had she not learned that her master&#39;s control was absolute? Escape would never be possible. And yet, when a trip across the ocean presented an unlikely opportunity, she didn&#39;t hesitate. But was Tessa reaching too far? Was redemption impossible?
Even as a child Trey understood that there was no law to protect a slave against the whims of a white man. So there would be no justice for his family unless he took matters into his own hands. As an adult Trey swore that there would be nothing that would keep Baron Henley safe from his revenge. But even well laid plans could go awry. Particularly when his attention was diverted to the bewildering, raven-haired beauty he impulsively abducted." />
