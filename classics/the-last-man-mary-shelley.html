  <title>The Last Man - Mary Shelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Known widely as the author of &amp;quot;Frankenstein&amp;quot;, Mary Shelley horrified us with her notorious monster brought to life with more humanity than we care to admit.&lt;br /&gt;
Her later, lesser-known novel &amp;quot;The Last Man&amp;quot; (1826) explores similar thematic concerns, though from a vastly different perspective. The nightmarish story envisions the end of humanity from a ruthless and inescapable plague. Full of heart-wrenching loss, &amp;quot;The Last Man tests&amp;quot; the resilience of humanity, as well as its capacity for sorrow and grief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of Shelley&amp;rsquo;s literary works, &amp;quot;The Last Man&amp;quot; can be seen as the not only the most autobiographical, but also as a literary tribute and memorial to her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley , and Lord Byron amongst other members of her coterie. &amp;quot;The Last Man&amp;quot; is largely shaped by the events of Mary Shelley&amp;rsquo;s life, and, to a lesser extent, by some of the historical events of Europe during the 1810&amp;rsquo;s and early 1820&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Plot:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The story is discovered, in 1818, in fragments buried in an ancient cave, rumoured to be the cave of the Sybils. The writings contain the recollections of a &amp;ldquo;past&amp;rdquo; history occurring well into the future. The writings have been left for future generations as a record of the devastating plague of the late twenty-first century. The narrator is Lionel Verney, age thirty-seven, who is, to his knowledge, the last surviving human on Earth. He has left this record in the year 2100, before setting out to sea..." />
