  <title>Treasures and Travails - Chuma Mbaeyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Treasures and Travails: An Anthology, Mbaeyi investigates lifes immaterial treasures and the torments that often accompany them in poems organized under four sub-themes. The book opens with A Blade of Grass, a metaphor for the Christian belief in resurrection, setting the stage for other poems under the sub-theme of Nature &amp; Inspiration that point to nature as the impetus behind mans beliefs, activities and human progress. Experience the demise of Summers Might and feel the burn of winters heat as Mbaeyi artfully describes the role of natures vacillations in shaping our everyday lives. He not only speaks of seasons but also of the nature within and how inspiration is derived therewith. As you read the first seven poems, you will find that in nature lies all that ails and heals man.
Under Love &amp; Romance, you will take the plunge into a whirlpool of emotions as you discover the tendrils of love. In Germs of Love, Mbaeyi surmises that love does crazy things to expose our folly, but fools we shall remain for the fleeting thrills of love, lines that capture the essence of the thirteen love poems included in his anthology. As with many things in life, matters of the heart are often fraught with contradictions; hence, the anthology segues from talk of amorous thrills to the conflicts and contradictions that pervade human experience. Part Three opens with a reawakening of the life of an insomniac in the witty In Search of Sleep before touching on matters of patient confidentiality in Oath of Silence. Conflict  and its elusive promise of reprieve  is explored on a broad scale in Forever Beyond Our Reach, and its interplay with the emotion of love is at the fore in Where Memories Meet.
In the Final section, hope and despondency mirror the evanescence of lifes treasures and travails as one supplants the other in the poems included under the eponymous sub-theme. Join Toyosi in his quest for an alternate vision of his ancestral home in A Country Called Sub-Saharan Africa and enter the dark world of a fallen star as her footsteps fade into the night in Stalked. Ultimately, however, when the very core of mans existence is challenged by adversity, hope is what keeps the spirit alive  and it often takes provenance from a rallying symbol  hence the book closes on a note of optimism in Golden Face of A Lost Generation." />
