      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;Hypnobirth: Theories and Practice for Healthcare Professionals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a guide for healthcare providers who work with expecting mothers and their loved ones. Yulia Watters applies the theory and application of Milton Erickson to hypnosis during pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum, including an overview of the history of hypnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Hypnobirth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; does not offer a magical way to a pain-free birth, but rather an understanding of how hypnosis can address certain symptoms as well as unexpected circumstances associated with pregnancy and delivery. Healthcare professionals will develop a deeper understanding of the potential of hypnosis and how to practice its tools on a daily basis, learning to view hypnosis as a state of mind and way of being, as well as acquiring concrete techniques for its implementation. This work is particularly important to healthcare professionals looking to learn about hypnosis and its specific tools which they can teach expectant mothers during pregnancy and birthing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
