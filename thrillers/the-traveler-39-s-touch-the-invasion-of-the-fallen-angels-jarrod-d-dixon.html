  <title>The Traveler&#39;s Touch: The Invasion of the Fallen Angels - Jarrod D. Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This year Halloween fell on a weekend.&lt;br /&gt; Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember these &amp;ldquo;profound&amp;rdquo; lyrics from Bushwick Bill? Word. I sort of thought you might. Well anyway, guess what dear Reader? Your favorite Travelers have all returned for this immensely intense sequel to the internationally successful Part IV; The Mystery of the Thick Red Socks. Here is a spoiler alert: Patience is back! Passion is back! Desire is back! Gifted is back! And &amp;ldquo;SURPRISE! SURPRISE! SURPRISE!&amp;rdquo; as Gomer Pyle would say. The very first Traveler whom I introduced you to, in Part I &amp;ndash; The Greatest Touch, has returned. That is correct, my friend. The Ving Rhames lookalike, the incomparable Imagination is in the building! YES! And you will also be blessed by surprise cameo appearances from a few other Traveler &amp;ldquo;celebrity lookalike&amp;rdquo; heavyweights who touched your life throughout the prophetic pages of this life-changing 7-Part Series!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if Suspense-Thriller is indeed your preferred genre, then what you are about to encounter between the front cover and this back cover of my latest book &amp;ndash; The Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Touch Saga: Invasion of the Fallen Angels &amp;ndash; is a nail-biting, heart-pounding, &amp;ldquo;Haunted House Rollercoaster Ride,&amp;rdquo; metaphorically speaking, that will miraculously motivate you to touch lives wherever your travels take you, with the &amp;ldquo;healing touch of hope&amp;rdquo; from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ via the Holy Spirit. With that being said, if God is indeed IN you, then after reading this Inspirational Self-Help Chapbook I exhort you, my fellow Christian Traveler, to share the blissful blessings of God by reaching out and touching somebody&amp;rsquo;s hand, and make this world a better place&amp;hellip;if you can.&lt;/p&gt;" />
