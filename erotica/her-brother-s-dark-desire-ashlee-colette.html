      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
In this sexy bundled trilogy, you will find a dominant older brother willing to do whatever it takes to possess his little sister. Warner can&amp;rsquo;t keep his hands - and other parts - off Madison. He needs to have her in every way imaginable and he&amp;rsquo;ll go to great lengths to make that happen. But how will things change when their father gets involved? Find out in these three connected stories of passionate taboo love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Her Brother&amp;rsquo;s Dark Desire, Part 1&lt;br /&gt;
Madison shook her head. &amp;ldquo;You were right before. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing this. This is&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; Madison swallowed down the lump in her throat as she saw the fire in his eyes. &amp;ldquo;This is wrong, brother.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, it isn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; Warner said, his voice steady as he reached up and cupped her cheek. &amp;ldquo;If this was wrong, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t shiver every time I touch you.&amp;rdquo; He ran his fingers over her jawline to demonstrate his point and her body reacted accordingly. &amp;ldquo;Your hands wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be shaking against my chest. Your eyes wouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep flicking down to my cock and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be biting your lip at the sight of how hard I am for you.&amp;rdquo; Warner used his thumb to pull her bottom lip away from her teeth. He tilted her chin up until she met his gaze. &amp;ldquo;You want me as much as I want you. And we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want each other so badly if this was wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before Madison could voice another thought, Warner&amp;rsquo;s mouth descended on hers, one of his hands groping her breast while the other worked its way down her stomach. He could feel her trying to push him away again, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much effort behind the action. Madison gasped as his hand slid under her nightgown, coming to rest between her legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her Brother&amp;rsquo;s Dark Desire, Part 2&lt;br /&gt;
Once she settled, he pulled his hand away from her mouth so he could kiss her. The kiss was slow and sloppy and he realized that she was starting to fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, no, Maddie,&amp;rdquo; Warner whispered. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t fall asleep on me now. We&amp;rsquo;re just getting to the good part.&amp;rdquo; Her eyes were slow to open, but once they did, she smiled at him and he took that to mean she wanted him to continue. He sat back on his heels and pulled her up with him so he could start removing her clothes. It took some maneuvering, since she was still out of it, but he finally managed to strip her down to her bra and panties. He considered peeling her out of those, as well, but her limbs were getting heavier by the second so he decided it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the effort. Instead, he laid her back on the bed and pushed the cups of her bra down so he could have access to her nipples.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her Brother Dark Desire, Part 3&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple question. Did he use tongue?&amp;rdquo; She reluctantly nodded, fearing where this was headed. &amp;ldquo;Show me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, she had to stand on her toes to press her mouth to his, this time running her tongue along his bottom lip. His mouth opened instantly, practically engulfing her own in his eagerness. She cringed as his tongue started sliding over hers in a heated rhythm. As he deepened the kiss, he groaned at how warm her mouth was. When her father&amp;rsquo;s huge hands began to grope her breasts through her t-shirt, she hastily broke the kiss. &amp;ldquo;Dad, what are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In place of an answer, his lips crashed into hers while his hands continued to fondle her tits. Madison shouted into his mouth and attempted to push him away, but he captured both of her small hands in one of his and forced them behind her back." />
