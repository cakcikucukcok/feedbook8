  <title>Wake Up! - Gurpreet Sandhu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In every heart there is a thirst for truth. It does not matter how you are or what you are. People may think it is impossible to awaken to your real self, but it is possible right here, right now, for everyone. There are absolutely no boundaries in thisabsolutely none. Self-created boundaries are just excuses; that is all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurpreet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many spiritual seekers strive for self-realization; that awakened state that is so difficult to achieve. To assist in that search, Wake Up! compiles the teachings of Gurpreet, an awakened teacher who introduces you to your inner heart qualities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gurpreets simple, profound and universal understanding can awaken you to your real self, your higher self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided into two sections, this compilation of Gurpreets knowledge and insight can help you see your hidden patterns, your created self, and your ego. The first section contains a selection of questions and answers gathered from Gurpreets retreats held in 2011 and 2012. The second section offers a discourse on connections she has had with those seeking self-realization, addressing a wide range of issues from the mundane to the transcendent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her wisdom, Gurpreet shows you how to recognize your belief systems, your hidden patterns, and your ego/person and how to embrace everything you are in a warm, loving, kind way on the path to self-realization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for Wake Up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplicity and directness of both Gurpreet and her words will ground the reader deeply in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
