  <title>The Studs of Regal Bay: Scott Walker - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For Scott Walker, the act of incest had seemingly come naturally. Convincing the mother of his best friend, the friend who had been so instrumental in his own mother&amp;rsquo;s turning to incest, to follow in those very same footsteps, was a different matter. Convincing both the daughter and mother of that very same woman to have sex with him, that was somewhat easier for Scott, one of Regal Bay&amp;rsquo;s healthy young studs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;When was the last time you were made love too, Ursi?&amp;rdquo; he asked with a soft, soothing voice, using the nick-name that her late husband had often called her by. He saw a slight flinch of her head and her eyes dipped away from his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually, she answered, &amp;ldquo;Not since Daniel was killed.&amp;rdquo; She placed her hands onto Scott&amp;rsquo;s chest and looked to his eyes. &amp;ldquo;Even after we had separated, we got together once in a while. The kids didn&amp;rsquo;t know about it. Our divorce was never about the sex. We just didn&amp;rsquo;t get along much outside of the bedroom anymore, is all.&amp;rdquo; She looked into Scott&amp;rsquo;s eyes and whispered, &amp;ldquo;Nearly three years.&amp;rdquo; She quickly turned away and went over to stand in front of her dressing table once again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You deserve to be happy, Ursi, to be pleasured.&amp;rdquo; Scott said. &amp;ldquo;Three years is long enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ursula shook her head and looked over at Scott. &amp;ldquo;Why am I even discussing this with you? I should be pissed that you took advantage of my daughter. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What are you thinking, Ursi?&amp;rdquo; Scott prodded. She didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately answer and he moved to stand directly behind her. When he rested his hands on her shoulders, she looked up into the mirror, at him through the reflection. He saw that her eyes were damp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ursula sucked in a breath and very softly told him, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that I want you to make love to me.&amp;rdquo; She held Scott&amp;rsquo;s eyes in the mirror and saw his mouth curl ever-so-slightly upward. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t grinning as a wolf might, but smiling as a lover would. She turned quickly to face him again and said, &amp;ldquo;I know about you and your mother, being lovers. I could never do such a thing with Fred, I just don&amp;rsquo;t have that kind of courage in me. But what you and your mother have&amp;hellip;the love I know you must feel for one another to even consider such an act&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scott quieted her by pulling her mouth to his, and their kiss, the first of what would become many, lasted a full minute." />
