  <title>Legacy of the Elder - Fiera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Se vi povas legi ci tion, vi eble posedas la genon, kiu ebligas onin vampirigi. 
Mia nomo estas Fiera. Mi estas vampirino, kaj ci tio estas mia rakonto.
Translation: 
If you can read this, you may possess the gene that enables one to become a vampire. 
My name is Fiera. I am a vampire, and this is my story.
Fieras life has never been easy. Some days, just staying alive is tough. When she is rescued from prison by vampires, she thinks her circumstances are looking up. But theres a problem. Even though the supreme commander of the International Federation of Vampires has made it perfectly clear that shes not welcome in his underground world, that doesnt mean she can leave.
Fiera soon learns there are two kinds of vampires: legals and rogues. Legals have all the power, and as a result, the rogues suffer. They are expected to endure hate, inequality, and prejudice at the hands of legalsand after centuries of oppression, a nasty insurrection brews.
War is imminent.
Predestined to become the legendary fire goddess of the Elders prophecy, Fiera is told that her fate was sealed before birth. When she discovers that the one who has always loved her will die if she is made a vampire, Fiera is determined to change her future. 
Although published as fiction, Legacy of the Elder is the authors true-life account 
of her personal induction into vampirehood. Informative, tragic, and funny, 
Fieras story explains and dispels the myths that haunt human folklore 
as it reveals the heart and soul of the lovable and despicable creatures 
we know as vampires." />
