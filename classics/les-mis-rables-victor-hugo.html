  <title>Les Misérables - Victor Hugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Victor Hugo published &amp;quot;Les Mis&amp;eacute;rables&amp;quot; in 1862 it became a huge hit with the public, so it is considered to be his greatest work and one of the jewels of French literature. It is a tale of woe and angst, love, loss and redemption set in France in the early 1800s against a backdrop of revolutionary fervour. The name &amp;quot;Les Mis&amp;eacute;rables&amp;quot; means The &lt;i&gt;Unfortunate Ones&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;The Wretched&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel is in five volumes and is one of the longest novels ever written, 1900 pages in the French version,and contains the longest sentence ever written &amp;ndash; 800 words.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Set in the post-Napoleonic era just after the French Revolution, &amp;quot;Les Mis&amp;eacute;rables&amp;quot; is the story of Jean Valjean, a convict, who has just been released from prison after serving 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread. Influenced by the bishop to begin a new life, Jean assumes a new name and moves to a new location where he becomes a respected citizen and makes a fortune in manufacturing. The police inspector, Javert, is suspicious of him, but it is not until Jean&amp;rsquo;s conscience prods him to reveal his true identity that he is forced to flee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rest of the novel is set in Paris, where Jean changes residences frequently and assumes a number of identities in order to avoid arrest. Fulfilling a promise to her dying mother Fantine, he rescues a young girl named Cosette from the evil Th&amp;eacute;nardier family and becomes her guardian. They spend many years in a convent where Cosette grows into a beautiful young lady. Eventually, Jean leaves this safe haven so that Cosette may have a more normal life.&lt;br /&gt;

Cosette falls in love with Marius, a young lawyer, who joins a band of revolutionists at a barricade. Unbeknown to Marius, Jean is also at the barricade..." />
