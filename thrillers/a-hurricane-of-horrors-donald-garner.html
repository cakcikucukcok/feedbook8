  <title>A HURRICANE OF HORRORS - Donald Garner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalia Pavlakos was an influential businesswoman in peaceful Tarpon Springs, Florida. She held sway over her real estate empire from a stately Victorian mansion overlooking beautiful Spring Bayou. Natalia didn&amp;rsquo;t go out of her way to cultivate friendships and she always kept on reserve more enemies than friendly acquaintances. She held grudges against many people with whom she had done business in the past; many folks in town held fervent resentments toward her as well.&lt;br /&gt;
Natalia relished playing the puppet-master by manipulating the nuances of other people&amp;rsquo;s everyday lives. She smugly thought she had everything under control until matters reached a boiling point, until some of her business associates conveniently turned up dead as a result of violent altercations. According to the police, Natalia was about the only person around Tarpon Springs who possessed the motive, the opportunity and the necessary malice to carry out these heinous acts of violence. Natalia remained strangely tight-lipped about the sordid affair and threatened the city with extensive lawsuits if criminal charges were brought against her or her closest confidant. It&amp;rsquo;s up to Captain Blake Collier and his rag-tag team of small-town detectives to get to the bottom of the murders without first being crucified in print by the prejudiced local news media.&lt;/p&gt;" />
