      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author received a devastated news. After 4th semester she was expelled from her civil engineering university. The reason was: she did not passed a calculus exam. When the truth&amp;nbsp; was: the math professors had a crush on her, on a timid and a shy teenager. His crush was so obvious that a class of 400 students noticed it and constantly were joking about it and sometimes in front of this professor. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To save his reputation, the professor decided to punish the victim. To get rid of her, easily he failed her, as a calculus exam was oral, and there was no record of her answer. Never mind that the author was an honor student, but very little she can do. The time was 1960s and a sexual harassment was not yet coined into dictionary. How she was reinstated back into university?&amp;nbsp; How life for all her sufferings and wounds remunerated her &amp;ndash; please read this story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
