  <title>Afoot in England - William Henry Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This charming travelogue from William Henry Hudson, expert birdwatcher and renowned chronicler of English country life, gives readers unparalleled access to the quaint rhythms of village existence at the turn of the twentieth century.

&lt;br /&gt;
William Henry Hudson (4 August 1841 &amp;ndash; 18 August 1922) was an author, naturalist, and ornithologist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hudson&amp;#39;s best known novel is Green Mansions (1904), and his best known non-fiction is Far Away and Long Ago (1918), which was made into a film. Ernest Hemingway referred to Hudson&amp;#39;s The Purple Land (1885) in his novel The Sun Also Rises, and to Far Away and Long Ago in his posthumous novel The Garden of Eden (1986).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Argentina, Hudson is considered to belong to the national literature as Guillermo Enrique Hudson, the Spanish version of his name. A town in Berazategui Partido and several other public places and institutions are named after him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the end of his life, Hudson moved to Worthing in Sussex, England. His grave is in Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery in Worthing." />
