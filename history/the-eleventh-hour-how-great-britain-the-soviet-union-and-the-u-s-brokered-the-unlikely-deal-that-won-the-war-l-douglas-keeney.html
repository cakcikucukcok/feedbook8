  <title>The Eleventh Hour: How Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the U.S. Brokered the Unlikely Deal that Won the War - L. Douglas Keeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In late November 1943, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his Joint Chiefs of Staff secretly boarded the battleship USS Iowa to attend a conference in Tehran with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, where the Allies would come to an agreement on a war plan to defeat Germany. Although Roosevelt&#39;s preparation at sea established the groundwork for the American position on D-Day, it was in the heated and electrifying debates that followed in Tehran-and only through those intense debates-that a deal was ultimately struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Eleventh Hour&lt;/i&gt;, critically acclaimed author L. Douglas Keeney explores FDR&#39;s covert conferences on the battleship and provides stunning insight into the formerly secret, behind-the-scenes transcripts from the meetings in Tehran. Brilliantly chronicling the three days of aggressive debates between the heads-of-state, Keeney demonstrates that Tehran, although remembered as a diplomatic conference with a well-known outcome, was in reality chaotic, conflicted, and subject to numerous heated, closed-door sessions-with a petulant, irritable Churchill; a strikingly reserved, detached Roosevelt; and an assertive but unexpectedly diplomatic and even charming Stalin, winning over his guest, President Roosevelt, whose quarters were bugged by the Soviets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly stitching together the private papers, diaries, meeting notes, and letters home of those on board, &lt;i&gt;The Eleventh Hour&lt;/i&gt; narrates declassified transcripts, exposes surprising secrets, and illuminates how the debates of three men would ultimately end WWII.&lt;/div&gt;" />
