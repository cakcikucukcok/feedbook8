      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After an atomic blast hurled the world into an uncertain future, the past still reaches out in hope…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and damnation. In a kill-or-die world, one steadfast group of survivors possesses superior fighting skills and sense of fair play that have made them living legends. In their struggle to seek a better way of life, they are unravelling the powerful secrets of the hell on earth called Deathlands.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A pre-dark legacy of shattering promise lies beneath the ruins of nuke-ravaged Seattle. Ryan Cawdor and his warrior companions come face-to-face with the ancestors of a secret society whose members were convinced that paradise awaited at the centre of the earth. This cult is inexorably tied to a conspiracy of twentieth-century scientists devoted to fulfilling a vision of genetic manipulation. In this labyrinthine ville, carved from the subterranean passages of a doomed past, some of the descendants of the Illuminated Ones are pursuing the dream of their legacy–while others are dedicated to its nightmare. Even in the Deathlands, twisted human beliefs endure….&lt;/p&gt;
