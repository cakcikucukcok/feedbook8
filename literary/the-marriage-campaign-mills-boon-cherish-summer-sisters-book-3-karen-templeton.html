        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He’s the Man with a Plan &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maid of honour at her cousin’s wedding is as close as designer Blythe plans to get to tying the knot again. But widowed congressman Wes Phillips refuses to take “I won’t” for an answer. Getting re-elected isn’t as important as winning Blythe’s trust and convincing the guarded beauty to take a shot at love…even if her scandalous past threatens to derail his political future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wes’s future with Blythe comes first – if they’re both willing to risk their hearts for a second chance that’s worth fighting for. Summer Sisters: Three women, bound by blood, back home where they belong!&lt;/p&gt;
