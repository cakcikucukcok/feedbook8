  <title>Imperfect - D. C. Shaftoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shaftoes willingness to put her characters in real danger ups the stakes, for a vividly realized adventure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary Marek is an Ontario police inspector who has crossed daggers with the wrong villain while working as a member of an international drug task force. After he is imprisoned and marked for death by his powerful foe, Albanian Mafioso, Burim Gjojak, Zach is presumed gone foreveruntil his brothers mount a daring rescue and return him to his wife and son. But after months away, home is not the sanctuary that Zach hoped it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His son, Gideon, recently diagnosed with autism, is a mystery of volcanic meltdowns and violent opposition to change. His wife, Christie, is a stranger. Determined to embrace the challenges of autism and win back Christies heart, Zach embarks on a cross-country journey from Niagara to Wyoming to reconnect and build a new beginning with both of them. However, Gjojak doesnt want Zach to return to any life at all. As he builds a web of betrayal and deceit around Zach, Gjojak sets a lethal snare that not only endangers Zachs life, but also the lives of those he loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imperfect&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping tale of danger and deceit and of love lost and found again as a police inspector attempts to defeat a drug lord once and for all and find the second chance in life he so desperately needs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
