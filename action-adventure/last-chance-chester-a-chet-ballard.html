  <title>Last Chance - Chester A.“Chet” Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Last Chance is a novel about a young boy named Chad who loses his entire family in a massacre. His only hope for survival is to flee into the wilderness with the familys Apache housekeeper and pray that her tribe will let him live with them. 
Chad has to grow up quickly if he is to survive among the Apaches. The hatred for the ones who killed his family burns inside him and the thought of revenge haunts him constantly. 
As he learns the Apache way of life, Chad does his best to keep the memories of his past alive. He is trapped between two turbulent worlds, that of the white man and of the Apache. 
Last Chance is also a story of the bonding of two people, an Apache Chief and a small white boy. Under ordinary circumstances, they would be mortal enemies. But, these are not ordinary times. Last Chance is also a heartwarming story of these two as they spend more and more time together and discover that they need each other more than they ever thought possible. 
Although Last Chance is a western, readers of other genre will enjoy this book." />
