  <title>Francis X - Sean Doherty, F. J. Doherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; On the evening of the 30th of January, the anniversary of &quot;Bloody Sunday,&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Brigadier Taylor received a phone call at his home from his daughter. She asked&lt;br /&gt; him to please speak with the woman that she was handling the phone to. The&lt;br /&gt; woman took his daughter&#39;s phone and asked Mr. Taylor if he knew why this was &lt;br /&gt; such a special day? Taylor answered, &quot;no&quot; and was told by the woman that he had&lt;br /&gt; a very short memory. The woman then reminded him of the massacre in Derry.&lt;br /&gt; Taylor then told the woman on the other end of the phone to get to the point of the&lt;br /&gt; phone call. She told him that a lot of innocent people died that day due to his and &lt;br /&gt; other British soldier&#39;s hatred of the Irish. She also told him that after all these&lt;br /&gt; years the tears are strill flowing from the relatives of those who were killed on that &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Bloody Sunday,&quot; Her next words were haunting to the old General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;I am in a vineyard here in Lyon and I am going to shoot your daughter&lt;br /&gt; while you listen to her pleading for her life and then you will know how all the&lt;br /&gt; family members suffered when you killed their loved ones.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The next thing Tyalor heard was his daughter saying a prayer and the sound &lt;br /&gt; of the gun being fired. The woman came back on the phone and told Taylor, &quot;She&lt;br /&gt; was a good looking girl and i hope you have an open casket. Have a nice day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
