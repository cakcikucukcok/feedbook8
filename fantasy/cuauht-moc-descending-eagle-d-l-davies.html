  <title>Cuauhtémoc: Descending Eagle - D L Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story takes place in the early 16th Century; a time when the world seemed to be expanding at an almost exponential rate. It occurs in South America in a land known as Maya: this is not a tale of what was, but rather, a story of what might have been if I had been in charge of that era. The main character, Cuauhtmoc, is born in a small village in the northwestern part of Maya: the story line follows his life from birth, through birdman-school, where he learns to become a birdman and carry messages. The account unwinds, telling of his adventures, his fights with pirate raiders as well as some of his own people; and by end of the book he is twelve years of age and is sent to the City of Emperors by the Commander of the soldiers garrison." />
