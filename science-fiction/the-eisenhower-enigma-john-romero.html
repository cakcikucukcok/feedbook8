  <title>The Eisenhower Enigma - John Romero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year, 1953. Science fiction is now secret and immediate reality. The toughest general who ever lived is president of the United States. His only weapons --The US Air Force, the mysterious Majestic 12, and Oracle Alpha, a young woman of strange gifts. Beyond them all, his own intellect and wealth of military experience must prepare him, must ready the world, for a confrontation and future never imagined. &lt;i&gt;The Eisenhower Enigma.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; I always wanted a soldiers life. The men I trained during World War I shipped to France immediately. My orders finally came in October, 1918. I longed to lead my unit into action. The war ended seven days before I was to sail for France. Now, my combat moment has come again.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;President Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; Forty F-86 Sabrejet fighters stand ready to attack on Feb. 20. Since I gave the orders the dazzling capabilities of the enemy craft and the reach of their weapons has gnawed at my mind. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Nathan Twining, USAF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; My life changed in 1952, when General Twining sent me to Duke University to be tested for intuitive abilities by Dr. Joseph Rhine. On our last day I asked Dr. Rhine what hed tell the Air Force. Just what you intended, he said. I smiled. Free at last. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oracle Alpha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The code word Valentine ripped through Colonel Torres earphones. Two ship integrity, he shouted. Kill the lights, follow me down to 500 feet. The Sabres moved as one. But against an enemy ship ten times as fast, his stomach tightened as he prepared for his own death. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lt. Colonel Mike Torres, USAF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
