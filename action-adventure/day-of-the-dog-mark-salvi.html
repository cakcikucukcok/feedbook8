  <title>Day of the Dog - Mark Salvi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 2020, racial tensions are on the rise throughout the United States. Protests and violence escalate throughout the country, and terrorists take advantage of the situation to launch a biological attack. Millions diebut even worse, the deadly disease known as canine flu afflicts the worlds dogs, turning peoples pets into horrifying zombie dogs.
In a small North Georgia town, those who survive the initial attack set out on a dangerous trip to Savannah, hoping to make contact with friends and family who have started a survivors community. The US military and government struggle to regain control of the country from the USS Ronald Reagan, an aircraft carrier, stationed off the coast of South Carolina; from the Looking Glass Plane, a specially equipped Boeing 707 carrying vital military personnel; and US Strategic Command, or STRATCOM, in Omaha. Meanwhile, American society is in collapse; the power grid no longer functions, and nightly attacks from the zombie dogs mean all survivors are in constant danger. Even worse, the Looking Glass Plane goes down in Pennsylvania, leaving only a few people alive trying to rescue the nation from chaos. Only time will tell if they will succeed.
In this novel, a terrorist attack brings about an apocalyptic landscape in which zombie dogs roam the night, changing survivors lives forever." />
