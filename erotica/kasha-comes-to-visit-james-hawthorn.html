  <title>Kasha Comes To Visit - James Hawthorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Beth and Dave receive a visitor to the house. Alice and Kasha have been exchanging messages. Pregnant by her brother, then again by their son, Kasha gives birth to her own grandchild. Kasha has some stories to tell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So, what do you know of Kasha ?&amp;quot; As Dave enjoyed the start of the morning, he turned to his daughter, &amp;quot;well, she&amp;rsquo;s my age, she&amp;#39;s had sex with her son and she&amp;#39;s from Wisconsin. She seems to be a bit down on herself, but from her own description of herself, I think she sounds real cute. Pale skinned, overweight, red hair, yup, she&amp;#39;s got my attention. But, I&amp;#39;m also embarrassed to say, I don&amp;#39;t really know much about sex. I enjoy it and don&amp;#39;t seem to have many complaints, but from the way Kasha talks, I think I have some things to learn, so I asked if she wanted to visit and she&amp;#39;s said yes, so I&amp;#39;m not sure if I need to hit the gym to prepare.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alice laughed sweetly in her father&amp;#39;s arms, &amp;quot;No dad, you don&amp;#39;t need the gym. At least, I think you&amp;#39;re getting plenty of exercise at the moment&amp;quot; Dave and his daughter both laughed, then they kissed, then embraced once again as the joys of love woke once more." />
