  <title>Anything He Wants: The Rescue (#4) - Sara Fawkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She never met a man like him before, a powerful billionaire who &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; gets what he wants.  Now she&#39;s about to enter an exclusive world of glittering opulence and all-consuming passion--where she&#39;ll explore the darkest reaches of her own desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lucy Delacourt signed a contract with Jeremiah Hamilton, she had no idea she&#39;d be caught up in an assassination plot against the billionaire. Barely surviving poisoned champagne, she is whisked away to a beachfront estate in the Hamptons that is fortified like Fort Knox. Safety comes at a price however - even as she learns more about her enigmatic boss, his refusal to let her in on the investigation confuses the still-recovering Lucy. To complicate matters, family members seek to drive them apart, straining their tenuous relationship to the breaking point. All the while, a deadly threat lurks in the background... waiting to strike. &lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other installments of the scorching serial novel Anything He Wants: The Meeting (Part 1), The Contract (Part 2), The Secret (Part 3) and The Betrayal (Part 5) available now!&lt;/p&gt;" />
