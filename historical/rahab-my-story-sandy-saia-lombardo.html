  <title>Rahab My Story - Sandy Saia Lombardo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the heart of Jericho, Rahab has a lucrative business as an innkeeper. Travelersand the local menlove to lodge at Rahabs inn because she provides them with much more than the basic necessities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being able to afford the best of everything isnt enough for Rahab. Something is missing. From the many patrons who lodge at Rahabs, she hears about Yahweh, His love for His chosen people, the Promised Land, and a covenant made many years ago between Yahweh and Abraham. She makes the decision to pray to God and ask for His help.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When two spies from Joshuas army ask Rahab for shelter, she takes a bold risk and hides them. The men tell her of the God of Abraham, and Rahab accepts him into her heart. The two spies promise to save Rahab and her family when Jericho is attacked. Eager to share her joy, Rahab tells her family of her newfound faith and tries to convince her family to trust Yahweh and be saved from Jerichos inevitable destruction. But will they listen to her message, or is their fate sealed along with the citys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bold retelling of the biblical tale, RahabMy Story offers a message of hope and redemption for all.&lt;/p&gt;
