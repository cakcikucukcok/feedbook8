  <title>Japan: Theme and Variations: A Collection of Poems by Americans - Charles E. Tuttle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This collection of Japanese poetry contains over 200 poems by some 153 Americans writing of their impressions and experiences of Japan.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Japan forms the theme of the poems collected here, the variations are certainly the deep feeling so many Americans have come to have for Japan and the Japanese People. And the Resulting Choral is, we are convinced, both a thing of beauty and unique expression of goodwill between nations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through the many years and in many countries poets have been entranced with the romances suggested by the name Japan. They have enthralled the sweetness of its children; serenity of its art; the beauty of its fields, seas, and mountains; the grandeur of its ancient architecture and quiet gardens; colorful pageantry of its history and deep emotions of its drama; the industriousness of its workers, charm of its women, and indomitable character of its people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
