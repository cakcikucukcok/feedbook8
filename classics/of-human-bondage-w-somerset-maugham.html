  <title>Of Human Bondage - W. Somerset Maugham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A nine year old boy&amp;#39;s mother dies shortly after the death of his father. He is sent to live with his aunt and uncle in a small East-Anglian village, where his uncle is vicar. This uncle holds the boy&amp;#39;s significant inheritance for him until he comes of age, giving him unlimited power over the boy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel is considered a masterpiece, and is also highly autobiographical, though Maugham claimed: &amp;quot;This is a novel, not an autobiography, though much in it is autobiographical, more is pure invention.&amp;quot;" />
