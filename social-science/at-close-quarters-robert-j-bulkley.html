  <title>At Close Quarters - Robert J. Bulkley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;The thorough and competent account herein of over-all PT boat operations in World War II, compiled by Captain Robert Bulkley, a distinguished PT boat commander, should prove of wide interest. The widest use of the sea, integrated fully into our national strength, is as important to America in the age of nuclear power and space travel as in those stirring days of the birth of the Republic.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;President John Fitzgerald Kennedy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Johns Bulkley (1880 &amp;ndash; 1965) was a United States Democratic Party politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives, and in the United States Senate from 1930 until 1939.&lt;br /&gt;
A graduate of Harvard University for undergraduate studies and law school, Bulkley commenced the practice of law in Cleveland, Ohio in 1906. Bulkley served two terms in the House from 1911-1915 from the 21st District on Cleveland&amp;#39;s East Side. During World War One he served as chief of the legal section of the War Industries Board. He was later elected to the U.S. Senate in 1930 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Theodore E. Burton. Bulkley was re-elected in 1932, but lost a bid for a second full term in 1938 to Robert A. Taft. After his term in the Senate ended, he resumed his practice of law." />
