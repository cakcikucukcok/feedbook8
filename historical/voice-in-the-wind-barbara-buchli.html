  <title>Voice in the Wind - Barbara Buchli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;It&#39;s very sophisticated - written with class and intellectual depth.&quot;
Carolyn Porter, Triumvirate Publications
&quot;I found (Voice in the Wind) hilarious.&quot; 
Michael Mercer, Barking Dog Books
&quot;(Voice in the Wind is) ...full of intrigue and excitement...&quot; 
Hallie Falquet, Doubleday Publishing
&quot;To say this is an unusual work would be an understatement!&quot; 
Allan Wilson, Barricade Books Inc
&quot;Barbara&#39;s story is both exciting and informative while her 
writing is beautiful and her imagination is wild.&quot;
Ariel Wagner, Doubleday Publishing
What happens when Robert, a wealthy diamond King from a primitive tribe that has never seen a white man before, finds the women hes looked all over the world for to be his queen? What happens when she finds out his world is a world of body doubles, murder, and constantly having to change his word and plans just to stay alive? What happens when the man in charge of Roberts affairs is also involved in the most powerful con ring from Nigeria and largest theft identity ring in America whos planning on killing Robert and taking over his lifeand shes in the way? What happens when she tries to figure out what&#39;s going on while obeying God and painting the most powerful mural in the world that heals and blesses so many that the Pope hears of it? Our story is what happens when God brings together two people who have both died and come back from the dead to do an impossible mission for God.
Barbaras story is as exciting as it is unbelievable. It is a true story never written about before. It&#39;s a story of adventure, mystery, romance, intrigue, miracles, the power of God, and most of all, faith." />
