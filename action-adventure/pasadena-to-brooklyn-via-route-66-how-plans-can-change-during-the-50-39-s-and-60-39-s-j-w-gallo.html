  <title>Pasadena to Brooklyn Via Route 66-How Plans Can Change-During the 50&#39;S and 60&#39;S - J W Gallo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &quot;Coming of Age Story/Drama&quot;. Vince, who grew up on the streets of Brooklyn, New York during the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s, moves to California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving he enters high school, where he encounters harassment from four boys. They were making derogatory statements about his nationality and asked Vince, if he was in the Mafia, since he was Sicilian. His father tells him about the Mafia and how it played a role in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point Vince makes a vow to return to Brooklyn. In 1961 he makes a Road Trip from Pasadena to Brooklyn via Route 66. Once he makes it to Brooklyn, he ends up staying for three months. During which time he rekindles a love interest with an old girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finds out how much the Mafia was a part of the lives of people he knows, mainly the girl he falls in love with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince decides to return to California because of an ongoing conflict he was having with a candidate running for Assemblyman. Just before leaving he is confronted by his future fiances&#39; father. He threatens Vince by telling him that his daughter better not leave Brooklyn. Vince doesn&#39;t know that he is a Mafioso. &lt;/p&gt;" />
