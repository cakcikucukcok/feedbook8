  <title>Not Bad People - Brandy Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A clever, compelling debut&amp;#160;novel with a unique premise of what happens when three best friends engage in what seems to be a harmless act, but instead results in tragedy, leading the women to confront buried resentments, shattering secrets, dark lies, and the moral consequences that could alter their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three friends, thirty years of shared secrets, one impulsive gesture&amp;#8230;and a terrible accident.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;When friendship goes bad, someone has to pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve. Three thirty-something women&amp;#8212;Aimee, Melinda and Lou&amp;#8212;best friends for decades, let off sky lanterns filled with resolutions: for meaning, for freedom, for money. As the glowing paper bags float away, there&#39;s a bright flare in the distance. It could be a sign of luck&amp;#8212;or the start of a complete nightmare that will upend their friendships, families, and careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after their ceremony, the newspapers report a small plane crash&amp;#8212;two victims pulled from the wreckage, one a young boy. Were they responsible? Aimee thinks they are, Melinda won&#39;t accept it, and Lou has problems of her own. It&#39;s a toxic recipe for guilt trips, shame, obsession, blackmail, and power games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re not bad people. But desperate times call for desperate measures.&lt;/p&gt;" />
