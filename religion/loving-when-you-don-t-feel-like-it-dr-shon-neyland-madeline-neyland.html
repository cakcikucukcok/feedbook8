  <title>Loving When You Don’T Feel Like It - Dr. Shon Neyland, Madeline Neyland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When is enough, enough in a relationship? Marriage can be the most blissful relationship we can experience on earth, yet it canat the same timebe the most challenging endeavor. In Loving When You Dont Feel Like It, Dr. Shon Neyland provides practical insights into discovering and applying unconditional love in relationships. It is more common to do unto others as they have done unto you. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking has certainly eroded the concept of forgiveness, grace, and mercy. If we are honest, we have to acknowledge that unconditional love is really hard to seize and fully implement, as our natural tendency is to protect ourselves even at the risk of losing the one we love. Unconditional love is the ingredient that many are missing in their relationships, and this book provides the blueprint to build that kind of love." />
