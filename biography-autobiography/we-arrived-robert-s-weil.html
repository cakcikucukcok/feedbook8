  <title>We Arrived - Robert S. Weil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;In his first autobiographical tale &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Teenage Hobo&lt;/span&gt;, author Robert S. Weil shares what it was to be like to be on the road with his two other brothers (the oldest of the group was 14 years old). He deliberately finished the story with the statement &#39;we arrived&#39;. Readers would then ask him what exactly happened afterwards. So begins the rest of the story in &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;We Arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three brothers were reunited with their mother, a widow, and the rest of their siblings upon setting foot in Los Angeles. Adroitly weaving his stories right after their harrowing journey for 30 days between Cincinnati, Ohio and Los Angeles, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil vividly recounts the events that followed thereafter in &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;We Arrived&lt;/span&gt; from a near death experience on an alfalfa farm to hearing the horrifying news that Pearl Harbor had been bombed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later chapters, Weil tells of the family traveling east again, having his own career, meeting his soul mate, and what it was like to survive the Second World War, with pictures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
