  <title>Courage Grows Strong At the Wound - Robert C. Koehler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Koehler&#39;s mind is amazing and he has the literary skills to match. Simply reading this book, both your mind and your heart will be expanded. You won&#39;t see the world quite the same after reading it, so in a very real way the world won&#39;t be the same. Koehler is one of those extraordinary souls who makes you think a bit differently about the world - and thus he changes it, one essay at a time.&quot;  - Marianne Williamson, author of Tears to Triumph: The Spiritual Journey from Suffering to Enlightenment   Koehler is &quot;someone who has fought through unthinkable adversity and made a mission out of offering the world a view of peace, cooperation, benevolence and self-education taken on for the common good. I don&#39;t know many people in the world, if any, who are putting their shoulder to so noble a task. ... He empowers his readers to find the highest levels of personal philosophy in the most innocuous of places.&quot;  - Jason Stoneking, author of Audience of None" />
