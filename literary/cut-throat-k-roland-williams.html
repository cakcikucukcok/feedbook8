  <title>Cut Throat - K. Roland Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Quincy Underwood is a well known local celebrity in his hood. He&#39;s street smart, handsome, and the talented lead vocalist for Taboo, the hottest Neo Soul R&amp;B band on the East Coast. Quincy&#39;s deepest desire is to live the lifestyle that he knows he deserves: a life of luxury far removed from the concrete jungle and poverty he was raised in. However, Raymond James, drug lord and owner of the Melody Room, the largest night club in the city, has other plans for Q. There&#39;s no way he is going to allow his number one legal money maker to slip out of his grasp. Antoinette Sweet, wife of the owner of the notorious Cut Throat Records, is sexy, beautiful, extremely rich and has the ability to make all of Quincy s dreams a reality. All he has to do is sign a contract with Cut Throat. But what price will he have to pay for his dream to become a reality? Quincy is caught in the middle of a life and death struggle between two drug dealers, a passionate love affair and an FBI investigation that could land him in federal prison for the rest of his life, or worse, in a body bag. Ride with Quincy through the gritty streets of N.E. Washington D.C. as he fights to regain control of his life, and sing in his own key." />
