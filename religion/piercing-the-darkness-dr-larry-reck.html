  <title>Piercing the Darkness - Dr Larry Reck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians have chosen to turn a deaf ear and blind eye to the subject of spiritual warfare, deliverance, and demons. It is important to equip yourself with the proper ammunition in order to stand against Satan and those who follow him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must realize that Satan doesnt just hide behind every bush and under every rock. Sometimes he finds a resting place within our churches. He may sing a pretty lullaby to the church and prevent Christians from hearing the true Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demons have been at this game for a long time and unfortunately they know more scripture than most Christians. We must put on the full armor of God and realize this is war  not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers of darkness in high places (Eph. 6:12). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ is where our power comes from. He did not leave us powerless to overcome, but has endowed us with power to stand against Satan in such a time as this. If you were heading out to battle would you go unprepared  without weapons, without armor, without a leader, without an army?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the pages of this book you will find the help needed to overcome these obstacles in your life. You will learn, among other things, how to break away from generational curses and most importantly, how to live a victorious life in Jesus Christ our Lord and to prepare yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
