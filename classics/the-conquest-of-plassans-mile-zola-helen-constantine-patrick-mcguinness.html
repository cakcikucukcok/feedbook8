      <meta name="description" content="Abb&amp;eacute; Faujas has arrived!The arrival of Abb&amp;eacute; Faujas in the provincial town of Plassans has profound consequences for the community, and for the family of Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Mouret in particular. Faujas and his mother come to lodge with Fran&amp;ccedil;ois, his wife Marthe, and their three children, and Marthe quickly falls under the influence of the priest. Ambitious and unscrupulous, Faujas gradually infiltrates into all quarters of the town, intent on political as well as religious conquest. Intrigue, slander, andinsinuation tear the townsfolk apart, creating suspicion and distrust, and driving the Mourets to ever more extreme actions.The fourth novel in Zolas Rougon-Macquart sequence, The Conquest of Plassans returns to the fictional Proven&amp;ccedil;al town from which the family sprang in The Fortune of the Rougons. In one of the most psychological of his novels, Zola links small-town politics to the greater political and national dramas of the Second Empire.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.
