  <title>Do No Harm - Cliff Bacchus M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Al Chandlers medical practice is growing by leaps and bounds, but his reputation as an advocate of healthcare reform is growing even faster. Not only is he well-informed and respected, but Chandler oozes charisma, charm, and successso much so that the newly elected president, Abraham King, taps him to be part of the administration. He believes his life couldnt be much betteruntil he meets the mysterious and attractive Pandora Coltman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora can offer him a completely different life. She recruits Chandler to be an emergency room doctor on Atlantic Isle, a tropical paradise in the Bahamas. Chandler cant refuse her. His sense of adventure draws him to the island, as does his attraction to Pandora. Upon his arrival, however, Chandler comes to realize Atlantic Isle houses many unexpected, dangerous secrets, including some kept by Pandora herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, Pandora turns up dead, and Chandler has to wonder if he might be the killers next target. He doesnt trust his new boss, Obi Falconer, who runs the Bahamas medical center. Falconer will do anything for power and moneymaybe even murder. Chandler wants to avenge Pandoras death and bring health reform to Atlantic Isle  but someone might kill him first.&lt;/p&gt;" />
