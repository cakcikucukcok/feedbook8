  <title>Grannie Knows Best - Aria L Suber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grannie is&amp;nbsp;more than a black woman on the cover&amp;nbsp;of this book. The Author, Aria Suber, thought to change the cover after thinking many people might overlook &amp;ldquo;Grannie Knows Best,&amp;quot; but she said this picture was perfect!&amp;nbsp;Inside the pages are situations that people encounter everyday and Grannie shares years&amp;rsquo; worth of knowledge with people of all ages, races, and backgrounds. The book doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, along with the vibrant colors and tones of each character, the stories also have a way of showing the readers the simplicity of Jesus, how He works in our lives daily and how we can overcome any situation with biblical wisdom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, in a world where race is a problem, it&amp;rsquo;s good to see people from different races, backgrounds, and age groups brought together in one book. Grannie makes it her point to share biblical wisdom, be truthful and still have some sassiness about her character. We&amp;rsquo;ve heard the old saying &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t judge a book by its cover&amp;rdquo; and guess what you&amp;rsquo;re right. Aria Suber did an excellent job writing a book that covers, college issues, changing for the better after jail, why we are here on earth, and if God will always love you. These short stories aren&amp;rsquo;t your typical bible stories; they&amp;#39;re spiced up and eye opening for those willing to accept them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
