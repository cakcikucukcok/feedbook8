&lt;P&gt;STORM KEEPER &quot;A MYSTERY THRILLER&quot;  By: J. Henry Warren&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewed by: Molly Martin of Scribesworld 7/30/2001&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Jake Turner is a tad nonplussed to discover his business bank account is 
down to zero.  &quot;If hes stolen from me again, Ill kill him.&quot;  This Philly 
merger and acquisition man has been hard at work putting his personal and 
his professional life back together.  Following Jakes divorce as well as the 
failure of his Wall Street career, Jake thought everything was at last 
beginning to come together.  Due to a new alliance, he is again making money, 
more than he thought he might, and he has an odd but deliciously wealthy 
client.   Things are looking up, Jake has not only gotten both his house and 
airplane back but his bank account has been filled with lots of money.   Now 
Jakes partnership account is down to zero and Jake means to find out why.  
His search begins in Philadelphia, but ends up on the North Carolina coastal 
island of Ocracoke.  Jake soon finds himself battling both the peculiarities 
inherent to violence and greed along with a Hurricane tracking straight for 
him.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In STORM KEEPER J. Henry Warren has produced a riveting work filled with 
complicity, adventure, conflict, treachery and greed.  This first novel 
page-turner will hold your interest from the opening lines right down to the 
last paragraph.  STORM KEEPER is a novel filled with powerful, well-developed 
characters, absorbing plot twists that keep you breathless and clever, and 
credible dialogue.  Writer Warrens Jake Turner character is a delight.  Take 
a little of Steven Kings taut fear producing writing in tandem with Erle 
Stanley Gardner artifice and you will have an idea of the treat in store for 
you on the pages of STORM KEEPER.  Those of us who particularly enjoy 
thrillers can only hope writer Warren is hard at work on another Jake Turner 
mystery/thriller for us.&lt;/P&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Delightful work, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
