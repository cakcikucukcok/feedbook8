  <title>Delia&#39;s Carnal Truth - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delia is a beautiful eighteen-year-old freshman. She has a loving, sexual relationship with her older brother Greg. They live with Mom in the single-wide trailer where they grew up. He tells Kendra she should have a regular boyfriend and that he would never ruin her life. When Kendra, a beautiful Army officer who knew Greg overseas, surprises him with a visit, Delia feels jealous and ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A stunningly beautiful, twenty-something woman had parked a new red rental car at the curb and now was checking the space number of their trailer. She wore an Army officer&amp;rsquo;s Class A uniform with a skirt, something Greg had described to Delia once when he was reminiscing about his time in the service. The visitor&amp;rsquo;s shining blonde hair was drawn tight into a bun beneath her hat. The sunlight caught ribbons and badges on her uniform as she walked toward the front door. The coat of the uniform was not designed to be form-fitting, but it could not disguise her sizeable bust. &amp;ldquo;Greg, it&amp;rsquo;s someone from the Army. Do you know her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He joined her at the window. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s Kendra! She&amp;rsquo;s a captain now. My god, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her since Kabul.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A pang of jealousy hit Delia. &amp;ldquo;You fucked her when you were in the Army, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Every chance I got,&amp;rdquo; said Greg. &amp;ldquo;We had to sneak around, because she&amp;rsquo;s an officer and I was enlisted. That&amp;rsquo;s against some stupid rule. It could have ruined her career. But when I knew her, she was a lieutenant. I saw online she got promoted. What&amp;rsquo;s she doing here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s older than you, isn&amp;rsquo;t she?&amp;rdquo; Delia&amp;rsquo;s voice took on an edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s twenty-six now. Young for a captain.&amp;rdquo; He didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to notice the change in her tone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll put something on.&amp;rdquo; Delia slapped his butt, harder than she intended. &amp;ldquo;You should, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Damn!&amp;rdquo; Greg hustled to his room at the far end of the trailer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her jealousy growing, Delia stomped back to her room, next to her mom&amp;rsquo;s room and a small bathroom. She yanked a turquoise and white flowered sundress off a hangar and slipped it on, then turned to the full-length mirror on the back of her door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spaghetti straps over her shoulders held the shaped elastic top over her boobs but the thin fabric showed them in detail with a lot of cleavage exposed. The back of the dress was cut low enough to reveal her lower back with an elastic band behind her shoulders to hold the sides together. Below the snug waist, the dress was loose and bouncy but the hem barely reached past her butt. Altogether, this was exactly what she wanted. Delia slipped into a pair of slide sandals and walked back out." />
