  <title>How to Research, Write and Publish an Art History Book in American Art - Diane Elizabeth Kelleher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title suggests, this book concerns the art and life of the world&#39;s only &quot;American Linear Impressionist&quot;, Lilian Westcott Hale.&lt;br /&gt;Born in Connecticut in 1881, Hale was educated primarily at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and lived for many years in nearby Dedham, moving to Charlottesville, Virginnia after the death of her beloved educator, art critic, author, and painter husband, Philip Leslie Hale. A woman, Hale far outpaced the success of many men, including her husband. During her early decades of activity, Hale garnered innumerable national awards, accolades, and prizes, and international acclaim for her oil portraits of children, women in interiors, and charoal sketches of snowy landscapes, all created in an Impressionist style utilizing only vertical strokes. Hale was the originator and sole practitioner of a technique which paradoxically used line in an Impressionist manner. While her classic art fell out of favor during the Modernist 1940s, it is now once again very much in vogue.&lt;/p&gt;
