  <title>The Guiding Light - Carol Beverley-Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These are poems written for the hearts that yearn after
God. It all came about one day when God spoke to me
and told me I was to write. I followed his instruction and
The Guiding Light Christian Poetry book came about, a
collection of poems that is a guide and a beacon of light
for others to read and enjoy on their spiritual journey. I
was never a writer or a poet and that is significant because
I did not do it on my own. I did not choose. God chose
me and he wanted me to share my experiences and my
thoughts to connect with others who may be experiencing
the same things and offer wise and nurturing words.
Experience the Fathers uplifting encouragement, as
these poems are all from my heart and are dedicated to
God because he wanted me to communicate my beliefs
and glorify him through poetry. He told me I was special
and a work of art and I was to fulfill my purpose and my
destiny and the sum of my days.
You are sure to find a poem to suit your circumstances
that will inspire, encourage and give you hope and when
you need a reminder of Gods grace." />
