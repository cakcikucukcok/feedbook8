  <title>Lethal Secrets - Pete Earley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was thought that during the height of tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, the KGB may have cleverly smuggled a nuclear bomb into the very heart of Washington D.C. In Pete Earley&#39;s new thriller, Lethal Secrets, this bomb is in the hands of a band of Chechen rebels, lead by an insane terrorist, Movladi &#39;the Viper&#39; Islamov, who&#39;s threatening to detonate it unless his demands are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of the city rests in the hands of a disgraced deputy U.S. Marshal, Wyatt Conway, who is reluctantly called into action by his FBI and CIA rivals because he was once a friend of Islamov&#39;s, before the freedom fighter turned into an international terrorist. &lt;br&gt;But to stop Islamov, Conway must trust Vladimir Khrenkov, a possibly corrupt Russian intelligence agent, and Kimberly Lodge, a skeptical CIA beauty. Conway suspects Khrenkov of being the man who executed a top Russian mobster that Conway was protecting in federal witness protection program. And the CIA&#39;s Lodge isn&#39;t all that certain Conway is capable of outwitting the terrorists and protecting the capital of the free world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With time running out, Conway must find a way to manipulate and expose Khrenkov, keep Lodge and her bureaucratic cronies off his back, and prevent Islamov from igniting the spark for Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
