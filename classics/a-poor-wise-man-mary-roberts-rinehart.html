&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Roberts Rinehart (August 12, 1876 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1958) was an American writer, often called the American Agatha Christie, although her first mystery novel was published 14 years before Christie&amp;#39;s first novel in 1920. Rinehart is considered the source of the phrase &amp;quot;The butler did it&amp;quot; from her novel The Door (1930), although the novel does not use the exact phrase. Rinehart is also considered to have invented the &amp;quot;Had-I-But-Known&amp;quot; school of mystery writing, with the publication of The Circular Staircase (1908)." />
