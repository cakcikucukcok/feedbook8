  <title>Deadly Game - Cara Lockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FOLLOW ME: Overnight, Calypso &quot;Cal&quot; Morgan&#39;s sensual Greek summer abroad turns into a thrilling, high-stakes race to prove to the world (and herself) that her brand-new and very sexy boyfriend Daniel is not a murderer.  On the run together, Cal and Daniel must outwit handsome Greek detective Nico Theseus and face their attraction to each other - amid the stress and growing suspicions unearthed by the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautiful college student Calypso &quot;Cal&quot; Morgan&#39;s semester abroad had quickly become a steamy summer romance on the gorgeous Greek Isle of Naxos until the morning she wakes, after a night of hard partying, to find her new boyfriend, Daniel, in bed with her wild roommate Gia. But far worse than that, he&#39;s completely covered in her blood. Unable to remember what happened and unwilling to leave each other, Cal and Daniel flee with the handsome police detective Nico Theseus close on their heels.
