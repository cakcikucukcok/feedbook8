  <title>Good Intentions - Joy Fielding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Lynn Schuster didn&#39;t expect the phone call from Marc Cameron, the husband of the woman her own husband has recently left her for. She certainly never expected to feel such a strong attraction to him when they met and he offered her the perfect way to get even with her cheating husband. Savvy divorce lawyer Renee Bower warns Lynn to be careful. But Renee has a troubled marriage of her own: chilling suspicions about her stepdaughter&#39;s hidden agenda and her handsome psychiatrist husband&#39;s after-hours consultations. And now, as their lives unravel in counterpoint during this hot Florida summer, Lynn and Renee are learning more than they ever wanted to know about love and betrayal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Joy Fielding&lt;/B&gt; is the bestselling author of the now-classic SEE JANE RUN, as well as STILL LIFE, NOW YOU SEE HER, SHADOW CREEK, WHISPERS &amp; LIES, MAD RIVER ROAD, THE WILD ZONE, and other acclaimed novels of suspense. She divides her time between Toronto and Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Buoys the spirits of anyone going through divorce.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Perceptive.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--&lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;The pace is brisk and the appeal and underlying strength of Lynn and Renee prevails.
