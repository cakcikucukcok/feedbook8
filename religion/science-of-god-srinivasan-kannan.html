  <title>Science of God - Srinivasan Kannan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is all about being successful and happy. Many of us have everything and yet find the real happiness missing. We are constantly in pursuit of that joy which has eluded us forever, thus far. When we realize our true nature and origin, it enables our progression towards attaining a happy and fearless state in life.  
Each one of us is a  divine Soul; unborn, unchanging, immutable and eternal; an inseparable potency of that Supreme God, who dwells in us eternally. Though each one of us has the potential to experience a divine existence, being immortals, we have chosen to take birth in this mortal world; taking birth to die and dying to take birth again, in some 8.4 million bodies.  There is a mismatch in what is happening to us. We are immortals, but the bodies we acquire in this world are not. 
We can attain the divine, eternal world of God, if we realize our imperishable relationship with God, who alone can grant us the state we all seek. With that realization, we can transcend causes and effects of this karmic world, overcoming grief and pain. We  not only achieve material success, but also live a useful life, for the self, for our families and for the society." />
