  <title>Impasse - Royce Scott Buckingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Royce Scott Buckingham&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Impasse,&lt;/i&gt; a man is left to die in Alaska while on an &quot;adventure vacation&quot; and must somehow survive to get his revenge on those who betrayed him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Forty and facing a mid-life crisis, Stu Stark has lost his mojo. He simply gave up after being fired from his prestigious job as a prosecuting attorney for losing the biggest case of his career. So when Stu&#39;s best friend gifts him a one-week trip into the Alaskan wilderness to rediscover his manhood, Stu thinks it just might do him some good. But after a horrible week, Stu is crushed when he realizes that no one is coming back for him. Dying, Stu is found by a grizzled old hunter who informs that winter has set in, and they&#39;re not going anywhere for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins Stu&#39;s training to become the man he never was...and to get revenge on those who betrayed him. This adult debut by the internationally bestselling YA author is a modern day take on &lt;i&gt;The Count of Monte Cristo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
