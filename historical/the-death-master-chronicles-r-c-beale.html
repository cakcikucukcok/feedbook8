  <title>The Death Master Chronicles - R.C. Beale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this, the third book of The Death Master Chronicles, The Supremacy, the focus is on H. E. Rasskes grandson, Hermi. Henri Eduard Rasske Madariaga; schooled and drilled in the expertise of the Death Master regimen since he was eight years of age by his doting grandmother, makes the decision to become an evangelist. Called on at a young age, he tells his grandmother, Sophia Madariaga he will never use the training for its intended purpose.  At the urging of his grandmother, he devotes summer school vacation time activity to the study of this expertise, because she feels it will better prepare him for life in the modern world whether he becomes a Death Master or not.  Hermi devotes the remainder of his free time to visiting Horse Ranch Mountain. He finds great peace there and forms a tremendous spiritual bond with his grandfather. As he grows to a young adult, he discovers the surprise of his life on one of his visits to the mountain which houses Rasskes cave. After this moving experience, he is confronted with a choice and must make several concessions regarding his schooling and ministerial training.Upon entering the world stage as a minister, he is eventually confronted with another choice. He has grown to a formidable status in the evangelical community at a very young age and discovers he has enemies in that community because of his views and the manner in which he brings the word to his people. In order to protect himself and the love of his life, he finds the Death Master expertise a natural thing to use" />
