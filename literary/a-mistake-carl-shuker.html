  <title>A Mistake - Carl Shuker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In medicine, a single mistake in an otherwise spotless career can determine the rest of your life—even if the mistake was not your own.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Elizabeth is a gifted surgeon—the only female consultant at her hospital. But while operating on a young woman with life-threatening blood poisoning, something goes horribly wrong. In the midst of a new scheme to publicly report surgeons&#39; performance, her colleagues begin to close ranks, and Elizabeth&#39;s life is thrown into disarray. Tough and abrasive, Elizabeth has survived and succeeded in this most demanding, palpably sexist field. But can she survive a single mistake?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A Mistake&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turning procedural thriller about powerful women working in challenging spheres. The novel examines how a survivor who has successfully navigated years of a culture of casual sexism and machismo finds herself suddenly in the fight of her life. When a mistake is life-threatening, who should ultimately be held responsible? 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Carl Shuker has produced some of the finest writing on the physicality of medical intervention, where life-changing surgery is detailed moment-by-moment in a building emergency. &lt;i&gt;A Mistake&lt;/i&gt; daringly illustrates the startling mix of the cooly intellectual and deeply personal inherent in the life and work of a surgeon." />
