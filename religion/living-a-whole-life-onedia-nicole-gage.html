  <title>Living A Whole Life - Onedia Nicole Gage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living a Whole Life is what God wants for us. This is often treated as optional, however the person who suffers when we opt out of that Whole life is us. We need to seek the wholeness that God provides for us through His word and His Son and His Holy Spirit. God only asks that we seek Him and reach out to Him and share with Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; God&amp;rsquo;s word prompts, provokes and provides life. These sermons apply God&amp;rsquo;s word in real life situations in an immediate manner. These sermons are designed to support us through our storms and our STUFF. As we consider the words which God uses to Prompt, Provoke, and Provide Life, we need to be attentive to those words, we need to be directed toward action by these words, and we need to be overwhelmed by these words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Living a Whole Life addresses several of life&amp;rsquo;s most profound issues through sermons. Minister Onedia Gage boldly addresses these critical areas of life with an unprecedented transparency. Minister Gage encourages the audience to walk boldly before the Lord through her sermons. These sermons will inspire and influence changes which will return us to the life God has so graciously created and provided. Read Living a Whole Life with the anticipation of change and growth and development. With this anticipation, get ready for a new life, A Whole Life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
