  <title>Last Lawyer Standing - Douglas Corleone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Kevin Corvelli fled from New York to Hawaii after the sensational death of one of his clients three years ago. Now, in the wake of another client&#39;s death--a client Kevin had fallen in love with--Kevin would run again if only he could pull himself free from a couple of high-profile, high-risk cases. The FBI is investigating the poisoning of a young woman who happened to be Governor Wade Omphrey&#39;s mistress. The governor was off the island at the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean that he didn&#39;t order the hit or that he doesn&#39;t need a hotshot lawyer like Corvelli defending him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the DEA raids a local meth lab and Turi Ahina is picked up in the sweep. A career criminal, Ahina has set Corvelli up with plenty of client referrals, but Corvelli owes him for much more than that ever since Ahina saved his life. Now Ahina&#39;s only way out is to turn in the big man, and he can&#39;t just tell the FBI who it is--they already know that. He needs to find him and set a trap, a trap that won&#39;t succeed without Corvelli&#39;s help. The plan is simple, as foolproof and dangerous as a suicide attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the stakes rise, Corvelli gets drawn in deeper and deeper until the only way he can escape is to stick it out to the end in Douglas Corleone&#39;s most compelling legal mystery yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
