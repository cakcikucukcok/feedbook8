  <title>Only Angels Have Wings? - J.H. Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John H Evans has been a commercial airline pilot and airline executive for almost 40 years. He grew up as an asthmatic child in the confines of the mining valley of the Rhondda in Wales and was drawn to flying largely by his memories of a Second World War Bomber Pilot from his own village who went missing later in the war. This story tells of his search for his childhood hero, a search that took him from Canada, through the USA, the UK and finally Germany.
This book is full of Johns adventures in flying and his associated entrepreneurial activities in Europe, the USA and the Caribbean. He has inadvertently mixed with the Mafia, was almost involved in the escape from Britain of one of the key Train Robbers of 1963 and spent almost a week in 1971 flying John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Through his expertise he has been largely responsible for starting five UK airline operations, and in the Caribbean was MD of a local airline, during which time he witnessed, at close hand, the import of Russian arms into the Marxist run island of Grenada, where he and his family spent two years. He was astute enough however to leave the island before the US invasion began.
From Miami, where he spent a further two years, he handled a number of aircraft franchises, which took him to most of the islands in the Caribbean chain, and the book ends with his departure from New York the morning before the Twin Towers attack 
Now fasten your seat belts for an eventful and stimulating read!" />
