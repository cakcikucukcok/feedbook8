  <title>Secrets of Sloane House - Shelley Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Against the backdrop of the 1893 World&amp;rsquo;s Fair, a young woman finds employment with an illustrious Chicago family&amp;mdash;a family who may guard the secret of her sister&amp;rsquo;s disappearance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sloane House is among the most gilded mansions of Gilded Age Chicago. Rosalind Perry, the new housemaid, pours the morning coffee before the hard gaze of her mistress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s simple, Rosalind,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;I am Veronica Sloane, heiress to one of the country&amp;rsquo;s greatest fortunes. You are simply one in a long line of unsuitable maids.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back on the farm in Wisconsin, Rosalind&amp;rsquo;s plan had seemed logical: Move to Chicago. Get hired on at Sloane House. Discover what transpired while her sister worked as a maid there&amp;mdash;and follow the clues to why she disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as a live-in housemaid to the Sloanes, Rosalind realizes her plan had been woefully simple-minded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was ignorant of the hard, hidden life of a servant in a big, prominent house; of the divide between the Sloane family and the people who served them; and most of all, she had never imagined so many people could live in such proximity and keep such dark secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, while Sloane House is daunting, the streets of Chicago are downright dangerous. The World&amp;rsquo;s Fair has brought a new kind of crime to the city . . . and a lonely young woman is always at risk. But when Rosalind accepts the friendship of Reid Armstrong, the handsome young heir to a Chicago silver fortune, she becomes an accidental rival to Veronica Sloane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Rosalind continues to disguise her kinship to the missing maid&amp;mdash;and struggles to appease her jealous mistress&amp;mdash;she probes the dark secrets of Sloane House and comes ever closer to uncovering her sister&amp;rsquo;s mysterious fate. A fate that everyone in the house seems to know . . . but which no one dares to name.&lt;/p&gt;" />
