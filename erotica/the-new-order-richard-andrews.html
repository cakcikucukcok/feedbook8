  <title>The New Order - Richard Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Andrews thought he had the world at his feet. A perfect physical specimen born to a family accustomed to great wealth and even greater privilege, and with a fresh degree from Harvard on his wall, he thought that he alone was master of his future. And he isuntil he finds himself pulled into a world so unknown, so shadowy, so alien that even he can barely comprehend what reality really means now. &lt;p&gt;
Because of his special psychic talents, William finds himself inexorably pulled into the greatest power game the world has ever known. It is not the future that William Andrews had envisioned for himself. &lt;i&gt;It is the future that others had planned for him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
William joins an organization that rules the world from the shadows. Soon, his circle will include aliens from other worlds and their technology. His dark new world is riddled with dangerous sensual adventures that would shock his patrician family, and William finds himself just as powerless to escape the lurid pull of this new shadow society. He becomes the owner of two human slaves, whose devotion is seductive. His moral compass spins out of control when he is given the opportunity to operate a deadly pleasure resort. He then finds himself at the front lines of a major battle with an alien space armada, a war that neither side can hope to win.&lt;p&gt;
Williams lifethe one he didnt choosetests every moral and sexual value that he has ever been taught, and the New Order he lives in causes him to question almost every decision that he has ever madeor will make." />
