  <title>The Chaplain’S Cross - Ed DeVos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was mesmerized by the way the author captured the realism of how World War II was experienced through the eyes of the soldiers and their families  A must-read for all generations. &lt;br&gt;
Jim Walsh, former president of the 307th Bomb Group Association&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chaplains Cross&lt;/i&gt; is a thought-provoking, inspirational, historical novel honoring the chaplains and the men who serviced in the US Army Air Corps in World War II. It is a story of how God knits together all things for His glory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story follows two menone an army air corps chaplain and the other a Japanese fighter pilotas the two prepare for a battle that takes place over Truk Atoll on 29 March 1944, a battle in which the 307th Bomb Group is awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. The Chaplains Cross weaves together the actions of these two men, exploring their views of their faith as well as how they interact with those around them. Each man faces a crisis in conscience in his own way, leading to a surprise ending that continues to have implications for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative captures the historical accuracy of a major World War II air campaign  highlighting the ministry and sacrifice of an army chaplain who loved God, faithfully ministered to his flock The story seamlessly weaves the circumstances leading to Gods will in transforming  a foreign land.&lt;br&gt;
