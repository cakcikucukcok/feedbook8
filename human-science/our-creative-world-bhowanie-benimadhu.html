  <title>Our Creative World - Bhowanie Benimadhu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are often seeking answers to lifes most fundamental questions: &lt;i&gt;Who am I? Where did I come from? What will happen to me when I die? When did the universe begin? Does God exist? What is my purpose?&lt;/i&gt; While both philosophy and religion can provide answers to these questions, it is ultimately up to each and every one of us to embark on our own spiritual and philosophical journeys to discover our own truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Our Creative World: Our Created Life on Earth,&lt;/i&gt; author Bhowanie Benimadhu shares his own journey to find answers to these and many more questions about the meaning and origins of life and the universe, and he invites you to join him on a delightful adventure back to the beginnings of creation so that you can partake in a mind-expanding experience of the conscious and subconscious mind. You will discover how all living entities in Gods created world came into existence, and it will enlighten your thoughts and broaden your mind so that you can understand the infinite and finite realities of our created world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity is the highest of all of Gods creation, so may God protect us and grant us wisdom, may we gain energy to know the truth, may our intellects grow clear and bright, and may we cherish no ill feelings toward anyone. By seeking answers to lifes mysteries, these hopes can become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
