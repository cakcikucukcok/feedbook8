      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Asael was once a man. Now he drinks blood merely to stay alive. Once a strong warrior who failed miserably in a mission and subsequently killed his evil master, Asael is now haunted by his memories. Others of his kind surround himMordecai with his gentle nature, Nafretiti with her passionate spirit, and Cain with his ancient wisdom. But when their resting place is attacked and their coven left broken, together they stand on the cusp of death, prepared to change the face of humanity forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the pristine society of Rome to the filth-ridden dystopia of modern times, dark-hearted friends Asael and Mordecai have always tortured or cured the frail society of humans at their disposal. But while Mordecai seems to becoming more human, Asael fears he is becoming more cold and methodical. As centuries pass, empires crumble, tyrants rise and fall, and humanity falls into poverty and decayall thanks to an evil aristocrat. When Asael decides to hunt down this blue-blooded tyrant, he soon discovers that sometimes all is not what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Immortal Touch&lt;/i&gt; follows an ancient vampires journey through a shadowy life filled with blood, death, and dark sympathy for the humans he encounters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
