  <title>Corp.Se Commander - Justin Mazzotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Not long ago, Americas corporations existed only on paper. But now, corporations have begun to assume human form, wreaking havoc wherever they go. As the corporate awakening spreads across America and thousands of corporations become living psychopaths with terrifying powers, hospital psychiatrist Tonya Regan knows the only thing that can contain these masterminds is the United States border. As Tonya flees Tennessee, she knows her hold on peace is as fragile as a spiders thread.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tonya is accompanied by Bruno, the police detective who saved her from her kidnapper, Revenge Corporation, and Mag, the bewitching corporate ally who is using her powers to help them escape. As Bruno battles guilt over knowing he could not prevent his citys anarchy, Tonya fights the growing feelings she has developed for him. Meanwhile, Tryk, an abrasive sorcerer obsessed with controlling their fate, leads their headlong rush across the country. Bruno is sure Tryk is an angel; Tonya does not trust him. As corporate titans gather their forces for war, Tonya is alarmed to see the groups desperation blurring their line between right and wrong.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this action-packed fantasy tale, Tonya and her newfound friends must reach the border before they encounter something none of them can defeat.&lt;/P&gt;" />
