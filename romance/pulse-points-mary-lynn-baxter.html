          &lt;strong&gt;THE MORE SHE TRIES TO FORGET…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kasey Ellis&#39;s life is shattered after she witnesses the murder of her friend and business partner at their Tyler, Texas, advertising agency. Though Kasey can&#39;t identify the killer, she believes the killer saw her–and that her life is now in danger. And, as if trying to salvage her company and her sanity isn&#39;t trouble enough, Tanner Hart has walked back into her life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE EASIER IT IS TO REMEMBER&lt;/strong&gt;A former bad boy who&#39;s made good, Tanner is now running for the Senate and needs Kasey&#39;s media savvy for his campaign. Accepting his offer means she can only try to forget that, twenty years ago, a night of passion in Tanner&#39;s arms left her with a son whom another man raised as his own. Tanner&#39;s return awakens emotions that never died. But as the media circus surrounding his campaign grows, so do Kasey&#39;s fears about the killer&#39;s identity…and about her own devastating secret. Soon there&#39;s nowhere to hide…from the danger, from the truth–or from her deepest desires.&lt;/p&gt;
