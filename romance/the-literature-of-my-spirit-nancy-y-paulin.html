  <title>The Literature of My Spirit - Nancy Y. Paulin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How can it be that life has so many colors inside? How can it be that neglect comes with so many fumes of madness? And how is it possible to find life, colors, neglect and fumes intricately locked away in one person, one body? One body with no room for shared sight or smell but the lingering sound of distant hope, caressing the crowning thoughts of the walls of her mind. Curiously, this sound that sought its way into her life had daily lessened its proximity to her heart. Although much time was constructed to close it out, remove its existence, it just kept coming closer and closer to her reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna Pennington hid away in her mind and heart memories that made her weak. Forbidden childhood, lost identities, cruel understandings, and more masked the picture of her appearance. She shrank, knowing that she did not know what it was. She only knew how it was. Yet how to find a place of solace without losing all she has trailed her thoughts daily, convincing her to do the unthinkable, to chase the heart of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Season of Desperation is a story filled with a multiplied measure of fugitive insanity, internal hope, and a final release of one womans experiences in a season in her life. Donna comes to realize that life truly is not about conquering the big things but about managing the small places in her mind, as well as finding her place in the lives of those who have shaped her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
