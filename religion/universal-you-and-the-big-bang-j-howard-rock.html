  <title>Universal You–And the Big Bang - J. Howard Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To show from the Big Bang to the end of this universe observers and their souls are the reason for it all. How? By using published scientific facts, figures, and extrapolations from the bio-geo-chemo-physics fields of discoveries. Most of these discoveries are by the worlds top scientists and are generally accepted as facts. &lt;bR&gt; &lt;bR&gt; 
	This book discusses how the four primary physical forces and the many fundamental constants, through their designed-in fine-tuning and governed interactions, formed the ongoing evolution of our universe.&lt;bR&gt; 
&lt;bR&gt; 
	The steady flow of new scientific data and evidence since Isaac Newton has led to the Anthropic Principleits designed for us observers. The number of planets discovered in our galaxy alone, now many hundreds and increasing monthly, virtually leads to the assumption that we are not alone. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	Now many of those renowned cosmic discoverers publish strong personal suggestions that a super-intelligent mind, transcendent of the big bang, designed the whole works to produce observers. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	The singularity seems to have been a complete kit to create a universe full of inhabitable planets and observerson earth, thats us. The end product of observers everywhere is souls. Thats what God wants. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	The supply of hydrogen is finite, so is the universe since the stars will finally burn it all up. This, in turn, limits the number of souls produced for Gods transcendent realm of eternity. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	This author has discovered nothing but the designed pattern of events and their ultimate results. Read this book, assess the evidence, and you, too, will believe God did it all for his purpose." />
