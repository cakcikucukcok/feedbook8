  <title>Autism: The Potential Within: The PLAY Project Approach to Helping Young Children with Autism - Richard Solomon, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every parent wants to discover the potential within his or her child. For parents of children with autism, The PLAY Project can help.  Autism: The Potential Within describes the journey of Jacob Grant - a composite of all young children with autism - and his family as they learn The PLAY Project approach. The book follows Jacob along the path from early diagnosis until entry into kindergarten.  Through a series of office visits, &quot;Dr. Rick&quot; empowers Jim and Julie Grant to be Jacob&#39;s best play partners. He also guides them on how to use Jacob&#39;s misbehavior - tantrums in public, sibling rivalry, picky eating and sleep problems - to help him learn appropriate behavior and social skills. Over time, Jacob moves from nonverbal to constantly talking, and from self-isolation to being warmly connected.   Based on scientific research and decades of practice, this guide provides parents and professionals with a new way of working and interacting with young children with autism." />
