  <title>Witch, Please: A Memoir - Misty Bell Stiers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A touching and thought-provoking account of how a woman explored a spectrum of religions&amp;mdash;ancient and new&amp;mdash;and ended up, unexpectedly, becoming a bona fide witch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Misty Bell Stiers set out on a spiritual path to find a faith that worked &lt;em&gt;for her&lt;/em&gt;, and accidentally became a witch. She knew the Bible well, and got to know the Torah and Koran. She studied Eastern philosophies, even the stories of the Egyptians and Greeks. Finally, after overcoming an immediate prejudice (&amp;ldquo;Um, no,&amp;rdquo; she writes as her initial reaction), she found Wicca.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Witch, Please&lt;/em&gt; reveals what makes this mysterious religion so desirable for more than a million Americans. In her witty, direct, and heartfelt text, Misty explores spirituality, perseverance, and finding oneself. She shares what she uses her spell book, cauldron, and broomstick for; the significance of Wiccan holidays, many about new beginnings; the surprising history of Wicca; and what kinds of witches there are. She explains how in her busy New York City life, as a mother and a creative director, her faith grounds and sustains her. Her uplifting, you-too-can-find-what-works-for-you voice speaks like a best friend: relatable, honest, and encouraging.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This unusual and beautifully written memoir explores life and death and everything in between. It&amp;rsquo;s candid, but it&amp;rsquo;s also threaded with magic and has a warming, light-hearted playfulness to it. Bewitching original drawings by Misty are throughout, and Misty even shares ten original recipes for her Wiccan holiday treats (including the likes of her cinnamon rolls and roasted garlic rosemary bread, sprinkled with magic and seasoned with love, laughter, and healing).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;" />
