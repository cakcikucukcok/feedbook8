  <title>The Inception of Banaras Hindu University: Who Was the Founder in the Light of Historical Documents? - Tejakar Jha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Benaras Hindu University has drawn immense public attention of late. The widely prevailed notion that its founder was only one charismatic person, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya has now been legitimized by decorating him (posthumously) with Bharat Ratna, the countrys highest civilian honour.
Nothing can be farther from the truth. The documents unearthed almost a century after the creation of B.H.U. vividly reveal his status and role in the Committee for the Establishment of Benaras Hindu University. Malviya can be considered, at best, simply as one along with Mrs. Annie Besant, Sir Sundar Lal under the leadership of the then Maharaja of Darbhanga, Sir Rameshwara Singh, who led the movement for the establishment of the first denominational university in India.
These historical documents present evidence of how and by whom the colonial power was successfully persuaded to inaugurate a new chapter of Indias cultural history by yielding to the mission of establishing the first private university in the country." />
