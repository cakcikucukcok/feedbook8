  <title>One Love, Many Tears - Gertrude U. Uzoh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cynthia never knew that love could be free and whole until she came across love in its purest form. Battered and embittered by unfortunate experiences even from a very tender age, she was hardened and lonely, sad and in a shell. 
Paul and Edmond are men who define their own quality and create their own world. Standing out in their own unique mixes of strength, wealth, and good looks, still they are more than those aspects, and it is simply a matter of the heart before either of them can break in through Cynthias walls. Pauls love was soul-tearing, Edmonds mind-splitting. 
Okechukwu is a boy with mature instincts born out of the sheer power of innocence. As protective as he is, his love for Cynthia will have no end, even as circumstances accelerate his journey to the parents he has always missed. 
Lady D., even though she is greatly in the picture, never really knows she has a lot to offeruntil she utilizes a heaven-sent opportunity she has never regretted. 
Even Father Phoebus feels the same and would never finish recounting his awesome experience in Nigeria. 
Dike, Onochie, and Ofor may never tell how destiny outmaneuvered and manipulated them, despite their skill, cleverness, and plots. 
Mama Ngozi is one woman that, in her next life, might just ask to be blessed with mercy, no matter how little. 
As for Susan, love lives and life goes on, even more bountifully in the hereafter. 
One Love, Many Tears is an expansive collection of hatred, greed, murder, apathy, poverty, and hypocrisy, yet it is a symphony of love, refinement, power, self-identity, passion, and altruism. All beautifully harmonized in one piece!" />
