  <title>Savage Tango - Joshua Macleod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s June in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, and the only thing that&#39;s hotter than the pavement is Bartholomew Augustus Savages personal and professional life. August, a self-described beach bum who takes his retirement in installments, is neither a police officer nor a licensed private investigator; rather, he&#39;s a self-described &quot;waste management consultant who professionally and discreetly takes out the waste for a fee. But to his friends on the beach, and his land lady, Mrs. Agnes, all of whom are clueless about his true profession, hes just good ole August, a brother surfer, and good tenant. A combat hardened Ex-Navy Seal and Ex-French Foreign Legionnaire. Augusts business cards read B.A. Savage, and most business comes via the internet. Just as hes claiming an especially gratifying victory in a game of beach volleyball, August receives an encrypted email. Terminate a 107 year old nazi in Argentina expounding Naziism by way of an underground movement. With his commandeered sailboat the Nauti-Buoy he travels to the shores of Buenos Aires, land of the Tango. There August poses as a vagabond pirate and locates his target and starts the stalking game. August, has stumbled onto some dicey jobs before, but nothing like the one hes just uncovered, with a bizarre twist. Thrust back into his old roots of death-dealing, August proudly stamps his seal of approval, B.A. Savage, where he shows a marked propensity to exact revenge for the ill-treatment and death of one of his new friends. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Told in Augusts distinctive humorous voice, in turns sarcastic and sensitive, Savage Tango will appeal to fans of Jimmy Buffet, Carl Hiaasen, John D. MacDonald, Bob Morris, and Robert B. Parker (RIP)." />
