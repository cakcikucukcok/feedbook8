  <title>Skeleton Island Fountain of Youth - Wilma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An American cowboy trained to Captain a ship in the mid 18Th. Century. Crippled while at sea. Traveling for Queen Victoria of England he finds the life of the American Indian&#39;s, the Hispanic&#39;s, the life of colored slaves and finally he finds the love of his life. His name is Captain Kismias of the Weatherberry plantation on the outskirts of recently named Houston, Texas. Finding himself surrounded by some of his best friends upon a ships voyage traveling within the spice route of the Atlantic ocean. Crewmen named Woodwind and Thunderbolt are some who travel with Captain Kismias across the high seas.
     Awakened by his own snoring ,&quot;Sinior!&quot; &quot;You need to wake up, you too loud.&quot; opening his eyes and hearing horses snorting, looking toward the ocean seeing the most beautiful princess, &quot;that he claimed, riding her black stallion.&quot; A few other women accompany her on horseback, smiling she turns toward Captain. &quot;My!&quot; &quot;Thought is, I might get lucky.&quot; With that in mind blushingly standing to his feet while stumbling, watching her looking back at him.&quot; &quot;Oh! Can this be happening?&#39; &quot; Walking out toward the beach, removing his shirt, acting like he is going swimming, trying to deceive her. Stumbling in the sand, with his bummed up wooden foot attached to his leg. Thinking she might get offended by such a strap on his leg. Hell she is still looking and smiling too. Removing his musket and sword wading non- schilantly into the waters edge. Turning looking down the beach she appears to be riding back toward him.&quot; Daring not to look up to soon, looking down at the waves motion, Captain steps out a little farther to lure her to him. water covers his lower leg and she has her horse pass him by, splashing water upon him. Thinking she was coming to see him. Notwithstanding she went past him toward the end of the beach cove, peering back from afar. Peeping up yet flabbergasted he hears the horse coming back,&quot;Whew!&quot; Proudly, lowering, his head down never looking up at her coming toward him, yet snickering beneath his breath. Suddenly a horse&#39;s leg appears beside him.Pretending to raise up his brow, staring into the face of a beautiful creature as God ever created. Reminiscent of younger days while opening gape mouthed, &quot;Hello, Sinyorita, he clamors.&quot;Dumbfounded he starts saying, &quot;hello.&quot; Smilingly she pulls the horses reigns up turning counterclockwise. The stallions head swishes past his face, throwing the white foamy froth from his mouth onto Captain shirt front. &quot;Who are you she asked?&quot; &quot;Captain Kismias he jests.&quot; As the black stallion stammers out a snort while stepping backwards, while she pulls the horses head back, tightening the reigns. Slapping the leather strap onto the horses butt, her beauty stuck inside his head. She rides in a fury down the beach as fast as her horse can run. &quot;She is evaluating me, Swearing she is ,&quot; Captain said, aloud to himself.&quot; Watching from the corner of his eye, &quot;i&#39;ll not let her see me wanting her, he thought.&quot; Suddenly she disappeared in the distance as if the sand swallowed her up, like a mirage. Pulling hard as he can his wooden foot is hung in the deep sand. He is almost falling down, dam the water is covering him, pulling and pulling the sand finally, &quot;with some suction,&quot; releases the strapped foot. Walking gimp legged back from the waters edge. Walking slowly down the beach thinking about the rest of the journey and drying his wooden foot. Even though, memorizing the treasure map on the bottom of his bright green inscribed carved wooden foot, yet weary of it fading in the salt water. walking back to the red tavern finding himself, lying in the loft soft hay, resting again. The night here was spent uselessly can not remember, if I performed well or not. Suppose it don&#39;t matter anyway she probably won&#39;t be coming back here, &quot;yet do vaguely remember yelling out, yippie y yaw!&quot;  last night. Then falling to the floor, &quot;kind of like fainting.&quot; Oh" />
