  <title>A Very Sick Practice - Janet Cee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If anyone injures another person, whatever he has done shall be done to him. If he breaks a bone, one of his bones shall be broken; if he puts out an eye, one of his eyes shall be put out; if he knocks out a tooth, one of his teeth shall be knocked out. Whatever injury he causes another person shall be done to him in return (Leviticus 24:19 20). 
The fleeting glimpse of a face disappearing in a crowd leads Alison to track down Kate. Kate had been her best friend when theyd both been studying at university. They hadnt seen one another for twenty-eight years. Alison confides in Kate the trauma she has been through, how it has ruined her life, and the hatred she has towards those whom she considers responsible for it. She is horrified to hear that Kate has suffered more, and that her life has also been ruined. Kate has the same anger and hatred for those who destroyed her life. They talk about revenge. 
Alison introduces Kate to Anne and Helen. Kate feels an instant rapport with them. She tells them the horror she has endured. Anne is enraged and tells Kate the two of them will punish those who have caused her agony. Alison and Helen want to help. Kate subtly names someone responsible for Alisons suffering, who should also be punished. Anne, Alison, Kate, and Helenfour intelligent, well-educated, law-abiding women in their late forties plot to avenge those who have ruined Kates and Alisons life.
An escapist fantasy at its core, A Very Sick Practice isnt exactly realistic, but it delivers plenty of cathartic fun. The characters are well-written, if a little extreme.
These are very angry women who have been victims of injustice. The reader can see that theyre passionate about achieving their revenge and righting these wrongs, but their story is not all about selfishness  they are intent on helping one another, not merely focusing on their own causes.
Some readers might balk at the lengths these women go to and what they consider justice.
Despite any flaws, one quality is paramount: A Very Sick Practice holds a readers attention from beginning to end.
