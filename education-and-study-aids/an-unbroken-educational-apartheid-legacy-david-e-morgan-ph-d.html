  <title>An Unbroken Educational Apartheid Legacy - David E. Morgan Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a thought-provoking book on the black-white academic achievement gap in Chicagos predominantly black communities of color and what highly effective school boards can do to change it.  In this book, the reader will be powerfully enlightened by a civil and human rights debate that calls for effective leadership in our schools, beginning with effective school boards.  The primary agenda of effective school boards is raising student achievement performance levels and engaging the school district community to attain that goal.  These instructive analyses of effective school board leadership  builds on the research and wisdom of great leaders.  Simultaneously,  it develops a breath of fresh air for school reformers who seek to implement a new model and escape the insanity and pathology inherent in school board dysfunctions and violations of  our civil and human rights which prevents progress in Chicagos south suburban communities of color.  In both highs and lows of awesome moments, as educational reform leaders and school board members, we are in a strategic leadership position to help school boards carry out their essential responsibilities for creating equity and excellence in public education.  In doing so, highly effective school  leaders can team with our school board leaders to lead our school district communities in preparing all students to succeed in a rapidly changing global society. 
School board members doing the same things over and over again and then expecting different results in academic outcomes is the definition for insanity.  Education is freedom.  In an era of mass educational apartheid with its consequent mass incarceration of blacks that has surpassed the enforced chattel bondage of slaverys peak numbers in 1860, this book addresses a subject that is critically essential, timely, and in need of immediate attention for the security, success, and ultimate survival of black America.  As the problems of the academic under-achievement gap is addressed in this book, it is also essential that school boards, educators, and community and national leaders accept reality, to view the problem in its true perspective, to contemplate it as it is, in providing essential solutions toward  removing  limiting and limited school boards   dysfunctions, obstructions, and other barriers to  academic achievement in effective school board leadership.  Supporting educational excellence will thereby produce more African American scholars in mathematics, science, and in many other disciplines.  This book will provide information and  focus on some key action areas that successful school boards in America and around the world have focused their attention on:  Vision, Standards, Assessment, Resource  Alignment, Climate, Collaboration, and Continuous Academic Improvement." />
