  <title>Whose Water Is It, Anyway? - Maude Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Maude Barlow is one of our planet’s greatest water defenders.” — Naomi Klein, bestselling author of &lt;cite&gt;This Changes Everything &lt;/cite&gt;and&lt;cite&gt; The Shock Doctrine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Communities Project is dedicated to three primary things: that access to clean, drinkable water is a basic human right; that municipal and community water will be held in public hands; and that single-use plastic water bottles will not be available in public spaces. With its simple, straightforward approach, the movement has been growing around the world for a decade. Today, Paris, Berlin, Bern, and Montreal are just a few of the cities that have made themselves Blue Communities. In &lt;cite&gt;Whose Water Is It, Anyway?&lt;/cite&gt;, renowned water justice activist Maude Barlow recounts her own education in water issues as she and her fellow grassroots water warriors woke up to the immense pressures facing water in a warming world. Concluding with a step-by-step guide to making your own community blue, Maude Barlow’s latest book is a heartening example of how ordinary people can effect enormous change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
