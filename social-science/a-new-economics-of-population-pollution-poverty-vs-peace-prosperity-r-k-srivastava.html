  <title>A New Economics of Population, Pollution &amp; Poverty Vs Peace &amp; Prosperity - R. K. Srivastava</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author is an ex-banker of a nationalized bank named Allahabad Bank and has served in various capacities as senior manager. His tenure in the rural / semi urban / urban &amp; metro branches has brought him face-to-face with the abject poverty and sturdy and stupendous problems of the poor &amp; unemployed people especially of the rural masses. His deep concern for their socio-economic upliftment always motivated him to find a lasting solution to their problems which culminated in the form of this book. The book deals with the problem of over population of India and its byproducts like abject poverty, mass unemployment and growing pollution level in India. It takes up the impact of over population on our environment, causing global warming, in addition to creating a threat to our environment &amp; biodiversity. The author has endeavored to arrive at a scientific calculation of optimum population for India to be adhered to. He has also propounded a new theory in his book, termed as The Law of Conservation of Life-Matter, through which he emphasized the imperative need of self-driven checks &amp; balances to be excersized by the humans of the whole world in general and Indians in particular. The book inter-relates the problems of mass unemployment &amp; underemployment, illiteracy and ignorance, inflation, price-rise, deficit financing, mounting burden of subsidies, growing NPAs of the Banks, heavy taxation and large public debt, falling value of Rupee in international market, the mounting foreign debt, child labour and women empowerment directly with the phenomenon of over-human population in India and proposes an immediate implementation of two-children per couple norm to be strictly adopted to control Indias burgeoning human population." />
