  <title>The Blacksmith King - Brooke Barenfanger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At eight years old, Lila Starwok lost her parents. Ten years later, she runs a boarding house for the people who raised her, her grandparents. There are several men who would like to court her, but Lila feels nothing but friendship for them. One day, a handsome, mysterious man steps into her life. He says his name is Asher Frost. He has secrets behind his eyes and a wariness to his face that never seems to leave. Slowly, Lila discovers his secrets. One day, Asher disappears, leaving only a note and memories that seem more like dreams. The only thing that separates dreams from reality is their love. But when catastrophe strikes, even that seems to be in danger of disappearing. In the end, Asher has to make his choice between selfishness and selflessness. Lila has to trust in Gods perfect will more than ever before." />
