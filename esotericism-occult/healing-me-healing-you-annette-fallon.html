  <title>Healing Me, Healing You - Annette Fallon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The poems within this book came to me through different experiences in my life, yet they seemed to come from the same placeplace of deep understanding, a place of knowing, a place I now know of as truth. It was through sharing these words with people that I found they too felt inspired, uplifted, and guided towards healing.
They can reach the deepest parts of our being, transforming us from the inside out. I am very grateful that these words found me and hope that they also reach out to you and help you on your healing journey.
Annettes poetry is truly magical. It touches my soul in ways that few writers have been able to do. I find myself bathed in a refreshing stream of unending wisdom flowing from the depths of her being. I am soothed, nourished, and connected to my own souls riches (Carol Roberts, teacher, rapid emotional healing facilitator, founder of the genome DNA stem-cell healing method)." />
