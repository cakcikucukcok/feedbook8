  <title>The Hidden Kingdom - Charles F. Tekula  Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Hidden Kingdom&lt;/i&gt; is an insightfully rich Biblical exploration by ex-atheist Charles F. Tekula, Jr. Tekula follows the story of Abraham and his prophetic legacy handed down from father to son. The Old Testament prophets pointed to a &quot;company of nations&quot; richly blessed in every way as the last days abode of the descendants of Joseph, favorite son of Jacob, who was grandson and chosen heir to Abraham. The Author has uncovered for us the eminently prominent place the United States occupies in the prophetic history mapped out in the Holy Scriptures, as it surely must if these ancient prophecies are to have any relevance for us today. &lt;i&gt;The Hidden Kingdom&lt;/i&gt; follows the prophetic bridge over the gap between the Old and New Testaments using the theme of the Abrahamic Birthright promises.&lt;/p&gt;  
     An earlier manuscript of &lt;i&gt;The Hidden Kingdom&lt;/i&gt; was put on file with the U.S. Copyright Office in 1999. It is included substantially intact in this volume. In that  manuscript Charles Tekula foretold, using what he had discovered about Biblical prophecy, that the destruction of Babylon, the great seaport city from the Book of Revelations, was to take place in New York City focusing on the World Trade Center." />
