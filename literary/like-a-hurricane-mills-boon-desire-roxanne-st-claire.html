      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Quinn McGrath&#39;s Irish grandmother always said he&#39;d know &quot;the one.&quot; Only, the well-meaning matriarch hadn&#39;t cautioned that the perfect woman would literally fall from overhead into his arms–or hate him desperately the moment she learned who &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Resort owner Nicole Whitaker was as wild and unpredictable as the storm that destined their meeting. But whereas Quinn saw the beach beauty as a fated lover, she viewed him as the six-figure-earning enemy who&#39;d come to destroy her dream.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was right.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that was before he discovered the meaning of paradise…and something worth fighting for in Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;
