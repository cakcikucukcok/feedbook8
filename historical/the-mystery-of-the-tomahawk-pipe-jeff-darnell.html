  <title>The Mystery of the Tomahawk Pipe - Jeff Darnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1924, and the small town of Monticello, Indiana, offers little excitement to sixteen-year-old Emmett Trentham and fifteen-year-old Billy Mac Finch who usually have to create their own brand of entertainment. But when the teenagers stumble onto a decaying log cabin hidden deep in scrub, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Emmo and Mackie explore the inside of the cabin, they hurl bricks at the fireplace, creating a large hole that reveals a secret room. After they slip into the tiny dark crack to investigate further, they are surprised by Maddie Miller, the great-granddaughter of the cabins owner, who has arrived after hearing the loud noises. As soon as the three friends discover an old Indian tomahawk pipe and a hand-drawn treasure map, they begin unraveling a perplexing mystery that includes the great Shawnee leader Tecumseh and a real-life legend of buried Indian treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this adventurous historical tale, Emmo, Mackie, and Maddie enter an unfamiliar world of ghosts, suspense, betrayal, and danger as they begin an unforgettable journey to help fulfill an ancient promise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
