      <meta name="description" content="In Cinda&#39;s first book A Gift of Poems she had written several inspirational poems since 1986...After collecting several of the poems, she felt it was God&#39;s timing to get them published in July of 2011...Cinda also wrote Prayers with Praise with some of her favorite Scriptures by writing them for her friend&#39;s website Soar with the Eagle, then had the prayers with scriptures published by Author House in September of 2011...In this book called Obedience Rather Than Sacrifice, Cinda has written about situations that occurred in her life in being submissive to her parents and then to her husband by trial and error with the Scriptures as her foundation...In addition to the short autobiography, she has included inspirational poems that blend in with some of the topics, also a documentation on the last days and the coming of the Lord. So, sit back, relax and enjoy yourself as you take time with the Lord as you read poems that will give you His peace and stories that will encourage you in the Lord.
