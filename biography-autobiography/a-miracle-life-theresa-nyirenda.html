  <title>A Miracle Life - Theresa Nyirenda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A Miracle Life is a MUST read book for every woman, parent, teacher, counselor and the general public. It is a book that will touch everyone that reads it. The book tells of the dilemma of a woman who had to suffer the agonizing problems of a child who could not understand why he was different from other children who could easily read and write. It tells of the problem a grandmother had of bringing up a child, born prematurely and who turned out to be dyslexic. The book tells of a society which knew nothing of dyslexia and thought the child was abnormally dull and could not be helped. The woman struggled and managed to get her child through to High School.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The child himself suffered ridicule from his peers and extreme embarrassment from society which did not understand him and which rejected him at times. In the end Tiza becomes lonely and withdrawn. He starts fearing to go to school because his class mates laughed at him when he failed to read and write properly. The trauma of it all is agonizing.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Theresa Nyirenda has resolved that no other woman should suffer the way she and her grandchild suffered because of lack of knowledge on Dyslexia. Through this book, she has taken a stand to sensitize the public and lobby everybody concerned that Dyslexia is real and dyslexics should be helped because these people have special gifts and if well trained, they could become responsible citizens in the country and the world.&lt;/P&gt;" />
