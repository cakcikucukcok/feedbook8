      <meta name="description" content="Hang around bikers long enough and theyll all tell you things dont always go as planned. That is proved over and over again in this collection of tales told by journalist and motorcyclist C.G. Masi.&lt;p&gt;
Join Masi and his band of merry bikers as they try their best to have good, clean fun while riding from Point A to Point B. Its all crammed into five road trips taken during the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;p&gt;
As they set out on their adventures, the friends have big dreams about making money doing what they love best  riding bikes. One of them wants to travel the country and make a living taking photographs. Masi wants to earn a living writing stories about his great adventures.&lt;p&gt;
And then there is Fred, who dreams of restoring a 1949 74 c.i.d., Hydra Glide Panhead. His mission will be the catalyst that leads to each rider falling victim to the different types of trolls that lurk under the next bridge or around the next corner in Shakedown Blues." />
