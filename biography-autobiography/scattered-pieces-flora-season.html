      <meta name="description" content="In Flora Season&#39;s debut work, Scattered Pieces, she recounts her odyssey of being a child who grows up dealing with the effects of witnessing her mother being battered. Today, Season is an educator who uses her classroom as her mission field. She hopes to bring awareness to the psychological implications of the thousands of children who fall victim to watching a loved one suffer from physical abuse.&lt;p&gt;
Filled with vivid childhood recollections from as early as age three, this intimate story of Season&#39;s lifetime quest for understanding, acceptance, and love will leave readers laughing, crying, and believing all things are possible.  It offers a riveting catharsis of a young woman trying to piece together the events of her life that growing up in a house filled with domestic violence shattered.&lt;p&gt;
The story walks through the inner workings of the mind of a child who has experienced trauma and more disappointments than one young girl should have to experience. Season takes us into her world and shows us how she adapted to her pain and despair to finally become a strong, motivated woman on a mission." />
