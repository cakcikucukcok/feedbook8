      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&#39;s always been off-limits... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Army Special Forces Sgt. Marco Vieri has never thought of Alyssa Scott as more than his best friend&#39;s little sister, but her return home changes that...and challenges him to keep his war-borne demons at bay. Marco&#39;s not the same person he was back when he protected Alyssa from her abusive father, and he&#39;s not about to let her see the mess he&#39;s become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;...but now she&#39;s all grown up. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Alyssa takes a job at the bar where Marco works, her carefree smiles wreak havoc on his resolve to bury his feelings. How can he protect her when he can&#39;t stop thinking about her in his bed? But Alyssa&#39;s not looking for protection--not anymore. Now that she&#39;s back in his life, she&#39;s determined to heal her forbidden hero, one touch at a time...&lt;/p&gt;" />
