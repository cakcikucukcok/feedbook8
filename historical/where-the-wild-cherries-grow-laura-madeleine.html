  <title>Where the Wild Cherries Grow - Laura Madeleine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How far must you run to leave the past behind in order to find love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Where the Wild Cherries Grow&lt;/i&gt; by Laura Madeleine, it is 1919, and the end of the war has not brought peace for Emeline Vane. Lost in grief, she is suddenly alone at the heart of a depleted family. And just as everything seems to be slipping beyond her control, in a moment of desperation, she boards a train and runs away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her journey leads her to a tiny seaside village in the South of France. Taken in by café owner Maman and her twenty-year-old son, Emeline discovers a world completely new to her: of oranges, olives and wild herbs, the raw, rich tastes of the land. But soon secrets from home begin blowing in on the sea waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty years later, Bill Perch, a young solicitor on his first case, finds Emeline&#39;s diary, and begins to trace an anguished story of betrayal and love that will send him on a journey to discover the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really happened to Emeline all those years ago?&lt;/p&gt;" />
