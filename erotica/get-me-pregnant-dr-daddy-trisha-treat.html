  <title>Get Me Pregnant Dr. Daddy - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ava has been feeling lonely ever since she went away to college, and she misses her Daddy, who runs a busy medical practice. She misses his attention so much that she fakes an illness, but Daddy is ready to make her feel better than her newly blossomed body has ever felt!
EXCERPT:
&quot;Now, Ava, you know that once we do this, there&#39;s no turning back. You might just need Daddy&#39;s cock from now on, whenever you&#39;re not feeling good. Tell me one more time that you&#39;re ready for Doctor Daddy to fuck you.&quot; He smacked his hard cock against my clit.
&quot;Yes, Daddy, please fuck me now!&quot; I wailed, pushing toward him. I needed him inside me, I needed him to make me cum
.
With my confession of need, he plunged his erection all the way in to me, hitting the deepest recesses of my cunt so hard that I screamed. He was relentless, thrusting into me harder and faster than I had ever been fucked before, not even bothering to remove his white lab coat." />
