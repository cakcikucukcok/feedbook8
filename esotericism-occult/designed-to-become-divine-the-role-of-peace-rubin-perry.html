  <title>Designed to Become Divine  the Role of Peace - Rubin Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mankind is not some cosmological accident. A chance happening on a grand scale, no, mankind is an
incomprehensible, creative delight of God with a destiny that far exceeds mankinds ability to understand.
Glimpses of mankinds destiny are fl eeting at best, but fragments are seen on occasion when spiritual eyes have
been opened to the unlimited possibilities of an expanded God-inspired mind.
We must grow our mind to know God as He reveals Himself to us. This is vital. Education and knowledge are
essential for life in the world. This book is about peace. Peace is obtained through knowledge and understanding
of the divine nature of God and doing as He directs so that we become like Him.
Mankind has been created by God to assume responsibility for assisting God in the management of His creation." />
