  <title>Twisted Justice - John L. Lansdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE MECANA SERIES continues in this action-packed follow-up to WHEN THE NIGHT BIRD SIGNS and HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWISTED JUSTICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;a Mecana novella by&lt;br /&gt;
John L. Lansdale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newlywed private detectives Thomas Mecana and Darcie Connors have barely shaken their honeymoon jetlag before taking on another case in the Lone Star State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dallas Homicide Detective Sunday Verves is looking into the suspicious deaths of local drug runners when she discovers a potential suspect that hits too close to home &amp;ndash; Angela, the daughter of her superior officer, and Angela&amp;rsquo;s lawyer boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the trail leads her south of the border, Verves enlists her old friend Mecana and his new wife into tracking down Angela and her boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they discover down Mexico way turns the case on its head and sends the group searching for clues to a bigger piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Sunday Verves finds she must choose between avenging wrongs of the past or righting wrongs of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the only choice is TWISTED JUSTICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John L. Lansdale was born and raised in East Texas. He has worked as a comic book writer for Tales from the Crypt, IDW and other publications. He co-authored the Shadows West and Hell&amp;#39;s Bounty novels with his brother Joe R. Lansdale. He is the author of Zombie Gold, and with BookVoice Publishing has released Slow Bullet, Horse of a Different Color, When the Night Bird Sings, Long Walk Home and several other titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Others are Saying about John L. Lansdale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mickey Spillane fans will welcome this page-turner...Lansdale effectively delays revealing the novel&amp;rsquo;s big secret until the end. Those who like their thrillers with a heavy dose of violent action will be satisfied.&amp;quot; - Publishers Weekly review of Slow Bullet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is an entertaining, science fiction-historical-horror blend with resourceful protagonists and a solid cast of secondary characters.&amp;quot; - Booklist review of Zombie Gold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Slow Bullet is a straight-ahead thriller...it&amp;#39;s about action, and there&amp;#39;s plenty of that. Check it out.&amp;quot; - Bill Crider&amp;#39;s Pop Culture Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...the author&amp;rsquo;s innate ability to spin a complex tale painted with vivid characters and intense suspense provides readers with a well-paced book that they may find difficult to set down...a worthwhile suspenseful ride.&amp;quot; - Amazing Stories review of Horse of a Different Color&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Has something for everyone&amp;hellip; It&amp;#39;s exciting, entertaining and educational. A fun ride.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; legendary TV personality/actress/author Joan Hallmark, review of Zombie Gold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...something unique and comfortable and difficult to put down. Highly recommended.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Cemetery Dance review of Hell&amp;rsquo;s Bounty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;True to Lansdale tradition, John L. Lansdale has compiled a piece of work that should appeal to a wide range of readers.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Amazing Stories review of Zombie Gold&lt;/p&gt;" />
