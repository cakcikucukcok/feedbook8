  <title>Girls with Autism Becoming Women - Heather Stone Wodis, Erika Hammerschmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new book investigates the experiences of seven women with autism as they transition from childhood to adulthood, and how they make sense of that journey.
Taken from the autobiographies of women including Liane Holliday-Willey and Temple Grandin, these accounts shine a light on issues unique to women with autism. They span a range of time periods, and look at how their different experiences of education, sexuality, career paths, and social networks affected these women while growing up. Heather Stone Wodis provides a detailed and thoughtful exploration of their common experiences, and each story offers a new perspective that illuminates the diagnosis from a different angle.
This is a fascinating look at how generational differences, such as access to the internet, can provide more avenues toward self-expression, political mobilisation, and advocacy. It also explores the idea that, no matter the era, the unyielding support of family, financial resources, and a diagnosis in childhood can help girls with autism transition toward adulthood." />
