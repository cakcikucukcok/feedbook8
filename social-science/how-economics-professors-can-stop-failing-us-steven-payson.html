  <title>How Economics Professors Can Stop Failing Us - Steven Payson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book provides an eye-opening expos&amp;eacute; on economics professors that will surely shock anyone who is not familiar with the topic, and even some of those who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; familiar with it. It is critical of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;behavior &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of economics professors, but is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; critical of the field of economics itself. In fact, the book argues that it is essential for economics professors to improve in the work they perform, precisely because of the vital importance of their field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other books that criticize economics professors typically present complex arguments that interest only the most advanced scholars. However, this book is completely different. It is written to be understandable to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;anyone &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;who has with an interest in economics, regardless of their background. At the same time, the book does include the most relevant scholarly arguments&amp;mdash;it just presents them in a manner that allows anyone to understand them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also unlike other books on economics, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;How Economics Professors Can Stop Failing Us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is written in the context of a genuine expos&amp;eacute;. As such, it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ventures &amp;ldquo;backstage&amp;rdquo; behind the &amp;ldquo;show business&amp;rdquo; that has dominated the profession, revealing the profession&amp;rsquo;s deep, dark, (and at times rather ugly) secrets. The book is able to do this by having an author who has experienced first- hand, studied, and written on this topic area for over three decades, who has organized training seminars on it, and who has served for over a decade as the Executive Director of the Association for Integrity and Responsible Leadership in Economics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While exposing the profession&amp;rsquo;s shameful problems, the book also offers great hope in providing realistic solutions to them. One of the main solutions it proposes is for economics professors who are now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;failing us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to follow, and learn from, those other professors who are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;not failing us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;who have, instead, admirably upheld the principles of professional ethics and scientific integrity. In this sense, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;How Economics Professors Can Stop Failing Us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; offers the most hope, and perhaps the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;only hope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, for economics professors to improve, and to play the responsible role that their students, their employers, and society overall, expects of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
