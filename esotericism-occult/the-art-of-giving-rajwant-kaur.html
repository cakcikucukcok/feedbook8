  <title>The Art of Giving - Rajwant Kaur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is related to what you have with you and at no cost you can give it to others. Well, in our entire lives, we just forget ourselves and forget about what God has blessed us with, and we go on chasing other things without discovering our true self. Fluctuations in our moods day by day decide that we are not living our life the way we should live it; we have not discovered the secret of life. We are just going with the flow as our ancestors, and we are not living a better and hopeful life. Whatever we get in life is all what we have given in our life. So giving is a great part of life. What should be given is a question so that we receive wonderful results out of it. This question is answered in this entire book, and if you really follow it, you will see a tremendous difference in the way you live your life. No doubt, there should not be second thoughts in your mind while executing everything you read because till the time you dont believe in it and follow it from your heart, you are not going to get wonderful results. As it is said, you have to sow before you reap. I cant help it, sweetheart; this is a law of nature which is above all of us. So just carry on and enjoy reading it." />
