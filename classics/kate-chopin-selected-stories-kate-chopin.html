&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The train was an hour and a half late. I failed to hear any complaints on that score from the few passengers who disembarked with me at Cypress Junction at 6:30 a.m. and confronted an icy blast that would better have stayed where it came from. But there was Emile Sautier&amp;rsquo;s saloon just across the tracks, flaunting an alluring sign that offered to hungry wayfarers ham and eggs, fried chicken, oysters and delicious coffee at any hour.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Emile&amp;rsquo;s young wife was as fat and dirty as a little pig that has slept over time in an untidy sty. Possibly she had slept under the stove; the night must have been cold. She told us Emile had come home &amp;ldquo;boozy&amp;rdquo; the night before from town. She told it before his very face and he never said a word &amp;ndash; only went ahead pouring coal-oil on the fire that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t burn. She wore over her calico dress a heavy cloth jacket with huge pearl buttons and enormous puffed sleeves, and a tattered black-white &amp;ldquo;nubia&amp;rdquo; twined about her head and shoulders as if she were contemplating a morning walk. It is impossible for me to know what her intentions were. She stood in the doorway with her little dirty, fat, ring-bedecked hands against the frame, seeming to guard the approach to an adjacent apartment in which there was a cooking stove, a bed and other articles of domestic convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yas, he come home boozy, Emile, he don&amp;rsquo; care, him; dat&amp;rsquo;s nuttin to him w&amp;rsquo;at happen&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In his indifference to fate, the youth had lost an eye, a summer or two ago, and now he was saving no coal-oil for the lamps.&lt;br /&gt;

Born in St. Louis, she moved to New Orleans after marrying Oscar Chopin in 1870. Less than a decade later Oscar's cotton business fell on hard times and they moved to his family's plantation in the Natchitoches Parish of ...<br /><b><i>The Awakening and Selected Stories by Kate Chopin</i></b> | In "The Awakening", a woman rejects the drudgery of her life and decides to live selfishly, for once. Kate Chopin captivates her readers with a story of transformation and growth, and writes with clarity and ease. Perhaps most enjoyable about "The Awakening" and Kate Chopin's short stories is the vivid New Orleans setting.<br /><b><i>The Awakening, and Selected Stories: Chopin, Kate ...</i></b> | Katherine O'Flaherty (1850 - 1904), known by her married name Kate Chopin, was an American author of short stories and novels.
