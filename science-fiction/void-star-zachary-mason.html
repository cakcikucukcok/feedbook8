  <title>Void Star - Zachary Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A riveting, beautifully written, fugue-like novel of AIs, memory, violence, and mortality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not far in the future the seas have risen and the central latitudes are emptying, but it&#39;s still a good time to be rich in San Francisco, where weapons drones patrol the skies to keep out the multitudinous poor. Irina isn&#39;t rich, not quite, but she does have an artificial memory that gives her perfect recall and lets her act as a medium between her various employers and their AIs, which are complex to the point of opacity. It&#39;s a good gig, paying enough for the annual visits to the Mayo Clinic that keep her from aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kern has no such access; he&#39;s one of the many refugees in the sprawling drone-built favelas on the city&#39;s periphery, where he lives like a monk, training relentlessly in martial arts, scraping by as a thief and an enforcer. Thales is from a different world entirely--the mathematically inclined scion of a Brazilian political clan, he&#39;s fled to L.A. after the attack that left him crippled and his father dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ragged stranger accosts Thales and demands to know how much he can remember. Kern flees for his life after robbing the wrong mark. Irina finds a secret in the reflection of a laptop&#39;s screen in her employer&#39;s eyeglasses. None are safe as they&#39;re pushed together by subtle forces that stay just out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivid, tumultuous, and propulsive, &lt;i&gt;Void Star&lt;/i&gt; is Zachary Mason&#39;s mind-bending follow-up to his bestselling debut, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Books of the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
