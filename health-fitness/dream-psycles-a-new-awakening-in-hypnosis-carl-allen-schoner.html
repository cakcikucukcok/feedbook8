  <title>Dream Psycles - a New Awakening in Hypnosis - Carl Allen Schoner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Dream Psycles&lt;/B&gt; is about self discovery through self hypnosis. This little book will empower you with simple techniques and sound advice that you can use right now to awaken and redefine subconscious patterns that influence your ability to accomplish huge goals in life. In addition to these powerful principles, you will learn: 
&lt;/P&gt;
	Why many people cannot achieve simple goals in life, while others achieve grand, even spectacular goals with astonishing ease.
&lt;BR&gt;
	How we are all essentially hypnotized all of the time, and that this is a normal state of mind that defines a person&#39;s life in the form of a &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Dreamscape&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;.
&lt;BR&gt;
	How your &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Dreamscape&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; is composed of &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Dream Psycles&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; that not only reflect your overall health, happiness, and fortune in life, but also control these aspects of your being.
&lt;BR&gt;
	How &lt;B&gt;set-points&lt;/B&gt; work in regulating and governing the mind and body, and how easily you can take control of these set-points once you master the &lt;B&gt;20 keys to controlling your subconscious mind&lt;/B&gt;.
&lt;BR&gt;
	How to create a positive, enriching &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Dreamscape&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; using any of the wide range of modalities, scripts, and techniques fully explained in this book.
&lt;BR&gt;
	How to exercise and maintain complete control over virtually every aspect of your life, effortlessly.
&lt;BR&gt;
	How to master the art of &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Thinking Big&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; - to think like a Giant - and how to actualize the ideas that you conceive.
&lt;P&gt;
This game of life is far too short to worry about what we cannot change, and much too long to live without changing what we can. Today is the day to begin! The techniques presented in this book will help you wake up, shape and master your own &lt;B&gt;Dream Psycles&lt;/B&gt;, and enable you to make even your wildest dreams come true!
&lt;/P&gt;
