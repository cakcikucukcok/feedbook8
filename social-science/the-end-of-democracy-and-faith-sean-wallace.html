  <title>The End of Democracy and Faith - Sean Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are born into an automatic social contract--democracy--that we never consent to. While seemingly championing the individual and the value of individual choice, democracy ultimately degenerates into collectivism and mob rule. Coupled with a reified religious mythology, widespread economic and market collapse, and deep political corruption, the individual is lost within a democracy to the collective majority. However, can a just, viable form of governance and society exist without the coercion of democracy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of Democracy and Faith&lt;/em&gt; presents an alternative vision that wrests the value of individual choice from mob rule and restores the consent and supremacy of the individual in the social contract. Eschewing faith and hope instead for a movement toward building bonds with our fellow men and women and for taking the reins and helping each other save our future, it explores the connections between our morality, identity, history, philosophy, and economy. And with the introduction of the concept of the voluntary state, it offers a philosophical foundation in support of using freedom instead of coercion to handle our responsibilities regarding our own income, retirement, health care, and way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promises of democracy and any individualism inherent to the founding of the nation have been largely replaced by a perilous, disenfranchising collectivism. Pursuing an alternative social reality--one that can truly enable free markets, overcome religious myth, and restore individual choice--represents a true challenge to the moral depravity of democracy and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain elements holding back our economy, the author asserts, though economists rarely make mention of them, due to their status as societal sacred cows.  His arguments against democracy are the most engaging sections of the book, in part because such cases are so infrequently made.&lt;br /&gt;
