  <title>Treeb and the Secret of the Sacred Forest: Book One - Ben E. Eld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Treeb is a worker bee who spends his days supplying the hive with nectar to make into honey. For generations, the queen bees have cautioned the bees to never fly over a border called the Forbidden Forest. The bees that cross it never return and nobody knows why. Despite the warnings, Treeb decides one day to fly through the Forbidden Forest in search of the Sacred Forest, a beautiful place filled with flowers. When Treeb discovers the land outside his home is barren, he becomes famished. But everything changes when he is rescued by a family and embarks on a mission to prevent the reset of the world. Accompanied by wizards and other humans and animals, Treeb’s adventure takes the group to eight gates that each must use a special talent to enter. Will the team make it to the Sacred Forest in time to save the world? In this charming tale, a bee recruits a band of characters to help him on a dangerous quest to prevent the reset of the world." />
