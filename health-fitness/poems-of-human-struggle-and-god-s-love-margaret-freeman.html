  <title>Poems of Human Struggle and God’S Love - Margaret Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Poems of Human Struggle and Gods Love&lt;/i&gt;, Margaret Freeman explores the theme of salvation: release from bondage to self-consciousness through the awakening of Christ-consciousness. She believes that this awakening to the glory of God is increasing on earth and she considers aspects of this through her poetry as she tells biblical and contemporary stories and shares personal revelation of the one who holds you dear.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Freemans poetry gives voice to our insecurities, doubts and questions  and the work of the spirit of Christ to awaken our own spirits to the fullness of the life God has for us, body and soul clothed in light and glory. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfiguration&lt;/p&gt;
Adam and Eve were naked;&lt;/br&gt;
No shame they had to hide: &lt;/br&gt;
Clothed in light and splendour, &lt;/br&gt;
A delight to Gods eyes. &lt;/br&gt;
Until Satan tempted them&lt;/br&gt;
To believe his lie. &lt;/br&gt;
He said God couldnt be trusted; &lt;/br&gt;
Good things he withheld. &lt;/br&gt;
He said they should seek out the truth&lt;/br&gt;
The apple would reveal. &lt;/br&gt;
And so through their own efforts&lt;/br&gt;
They were bound to self-rule, &lt;/br&gt;
To striving for perfection-&lt;/br&gt;
All men became its fool. &lt;/br&gt;
Their spirits now bound within the soul, &lt;/br&gt;
And animal skins for clothing, &lt;/br&gt;
They tried their best to work the soil&lt;/br&gt;
As Satan stood by laughing. &lt;/br&gt;
But God has not been outplayed; &lt;/br&gt;
He came to earth, you see, &lt;/br&gt;
To tell us he is the way&lt;/br&gt;
For our spirits to be freed: &lt;/br&gt;
Bound by grace to Truth and Light-&lt;/br&gt;
Our transfiguration. &lt;/br&gt;" />
