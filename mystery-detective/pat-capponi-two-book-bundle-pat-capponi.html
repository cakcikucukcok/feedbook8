  <title>Pat Capponi Two-Book Bundle - Pat Capponi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Private investigator Dana Leoni and her crew of misfit sleuths solve mysteries on the dark streets of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Last Stop Sunnyside&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Pat Capponi introduces readers to Dana Leoni. All Dana wants is to retreat from the traumas of her past, but, when her mentally ill roommate turns up dead and the police quickly run out of clues, she and her rag-tag group of housemates decide to take matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Corpse Will Keep&lt;/em&gt;, Leoni and her unlikely crew have opened a detective agency in the run-down Delta Court rooming house. Genuine clients are hard to come by until a friend from Dana’s past contacts her for help. He suspects his wealthy mother is being bilked in her charitable efforts to help the homeless. Though Dana is reluctant to reconnect with her past, she knows this world well and is soon on the hunt for a ruthless killer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With her skilful portrayal of characters who may be down but are never out, Pat Capponi brings to life a world few of us know and one of the most likeable—and vulnerable—investigators in crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
