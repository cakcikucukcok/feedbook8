  <title>The Prophet of God - David E Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to author David E Cooper, God has sent prophets in very generation to help the people in times of trouble. But many dont listen and live the way they desire instead of following Gods desire for them. In The Prophet of God, Cooper calls on everyone to be aware of what is to come and reminds them that now is the time to repent and go back to the Heavenly Father. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When we go through life, we want peace and happiness. The only way to live in peace and happiness is in Jesus. To live clean and holy for God, to see that God keeps you and your family and that you trust in God. You either serve God or Satan. There is no neutral ground. You cant live like your friends live. You have to live the Ten Commandments and read the Bible and pray, says the author. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Prophet of God follows Coopers life experiences interspersed with Biblical scriptures that will provide you with insight on what God wants for His people. The Bible tells about demons, how they try to manipulate and calls men to sin. The author warns everyone about how demons can come in disguise and trick people into committing sin. He emphasizes the need to rejuvenate ones faith, and to choose between life and death. If you serve God, your reward is life. If you serve the devil, your reward is death and hell" />
