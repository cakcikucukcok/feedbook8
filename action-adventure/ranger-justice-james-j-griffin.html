  <title>Ranger Justice - James J. Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Texas Ranger Lieutenant Jim Blawcyzk is on the trail of the men responsible for the killing of a fellow Ranger and the disappearance of another. Jim&#39;s search will draw him into a web of deception, greed, and murder, where even a lawman&#39;s best friend may well be his deadly enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
As Jim inserted the knife into a chink in the rocks, a bullet smacked into the wall just alongside his head, followed by the sharp crack of a rifle. Jim dove to his belly, pinned behind the inadequate cover of the ledge&#39;s slight lip as the hidden rifleman swept the rocks with an almost impossibly rapid fire.&lt;/p&gt;
As the barrage of lead stopped for a brief instant, Jim chanced lifting his head ever so slightly, scanning the canyon in an attempt to locate the bushwhacker. &quot;Got him spotted, on the rim over to the other side of the canyon,&quot; he said, as a glint of sunlight reflected off the gunman&#39;s rifle barrel for an instant. &quot;Not that it&#39;ll do me much good,&quot; he muttered, ducking back as his assailant finished reloading and again swept the ledge with a rapid-fire volley. &quot;My Winchester&#39;s still on my saddle, and he&#39;s way outta range for a six-gun, even tryin&#39; a lucky shot. He can keep me pinned down here long as he wants. And sooner or later he&#39;s gonna nail me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
As bullets whined over his precarious perch, Jim glanced downward, then, taking a desperate chance, threw himself over the edge of the shelf.&lt;/P&gt;" />
