  <title>The Escape - Adam Thirlwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haffner is charming, morally suspect, vain, obsessed by the libertine emperors. He is British and Jewish and a widower. But Haffner&#39;s attachments to his nation, his race, his marriage, have always been matters of conjecture. They have always been subjects of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many stories of Haffner--but this, the most secret, is the greatest of them all. &lt;i&gt;The Escape &lt;/i&gt;opens in a spa town snug in the unfashionable eastern Alps, where Haffner has come to claim his wife&#39;s inheritance: a villa expropriated in darker times. After weeks of ignoring his task in order to conduct two affairs--one with a capricious young yoga instructor, the other with a hungrily passionate married woman--he discovers gradually that he wants this villa, very much. Squabbling with bureaucrats and their shadows means a fight, and Haffner wants anything he has to fight for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you ever escape your past, your family, your history? That is the problem of Haffner&#39;s story in &lt;i&gt;The Escape&lt;/i&gt;. That has always been the problem of Haffner--and his lifetime of metamorphoses and disappearances. How might Haffner ever become unattached?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the improvised digressions of his comic couplings and uncouplings emerge the stories of Haffner&#39;s century: the chaos of World War II , the heyday of jazz, the postwar diaspora, the uncertain triumph of capitalism, and the inescapability of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Escape &lt;/i&gt;is a swift, sad farce of sexual mayhem by a brilliant young novelist &lt;i&gt;The New York Times &lt;/i&gt;has called &quot;a prodigy and, as such, unstoppable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
