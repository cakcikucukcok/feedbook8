          &lt;strong&gt;At seventeen, Anna Anderssen thought the sun rose and set with Mitchell Donavan.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thirteen years later, the boy from the wrong side of town was a successful architect who still hadn&#39;t forgiven her for their breakup. A man dangerous to know…and impossible to forget. Mitch had spent his whole life on the outside looking in. Until Anna.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he&#39;d learned his lesson with the former high school beauty queen–he wasn&#39;t going to make the same mistake twice. Only seeing her again was like a one-two punch to his heart. And he knew he couldn&#39;t lose her a second time– no matter what secrets were simmering between them….&lt;/p&gt;
