  <title>Ke Garne? - Lani Kay Ackerman Md Faafp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ke Garne, a common Nepali phrase which literally means, What to do? embodies the thinking of millions of people living in the Himalayas steeped in the belief that their karma has destined them to poverty and hopelessness.   
In 1991 an enthusiastic young couple, a medical doctor and an ecologist, left their jobs and sold everything to take the good news of Christ to a remote area of the Himalayas closed to traditional missions. God led them to establish and lead an organization, Health Environmental and Learning Program (H.E.L.P.), which has combined the principles of the Bible and wholistic sustainable development, following the model of Jesuss ministry. 
Ke garne is the fruit from decades of boots-on-the-ground, sacrificial devotion Want to be guided and inspired by exemplary, real-life Christian community development? It is here in your hands. 
Nicholas Comninellis, MD MPH DIM&amp;PH, Pres. &amp; CEO, Institute for International Medicine
The Ackermans are the proof that the Holy Spirit still anoints and empowers those He chooses to spread Christ&#39;s Gospel in the most effective ways in the places most needed. If allowed, God has no limits.  Lamar McNew, MD, Retired Professor, Texas A&amp;M College of Medicine, Chairman of H.E.L.P. board.  
As I read these pages and re-heard their story, precious memories of trusting the Lord for direction and provisions flooded my soul. Meet this special family, and be challenged by their obedience to the Great Commission.  Dr. Don Higginbotham, Retired Pastor 
This is a book that 21st Century Christians must read!  In an age of toxic charity and misdirected mission efforts, this is a book that issues a call for mission work that starts on the inside and moves outward.  Ive personally seen this ministry in action in Nepal, and without a doubt, the church needs to embrace this model!  Reverend Jerry House, Pastor" />
