  <title>Megan’S Cry - Gregory Pollock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reeling from the pain of being abandoned by her husbandthe father of her sonMegan Richardsons world is closing in around her in a dark haze of depression. She feels lost, without hope or answers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Worse, she must face the death of her beloved mother. She reaches for answers, wondering what really matters in life. Her mothers final letter to her may hold some of these answers, and Megan clings to hope once again. She reads the letter over and over, desperate to find the meaning of her mothers last words. Megan tries to understand the lesson the Lord is supposed to be teaching her, but she has pulled away from her faith of late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that lesson is hidden within her work as a nurse on a cancer ward. When a patient, a frail young girl, reaches out to save Megan from a panic attack, they make a connection. Sarah heals a bit of Megans heart with that moment, and Megans life begins to change. She starts searching for Gods place in her life  and for the man who will make her heart whole again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megan returns to her family farm in search of the solitude she needs. There she meets Darrin, the new hired man. Is he the answer to her prayers?&lt;/p&gt;" />
