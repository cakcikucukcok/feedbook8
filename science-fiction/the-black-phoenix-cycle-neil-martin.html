  <title>The Black Phoenix Cycle - Neil Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Lars and his companions...time-lost and scattered across the Worlds of a fallen empire.  
A year ago two Black Phoenix warriors appeared out of the dark of night to capture Lars.  His home was burned and his grandfather murdered.   From there Lars embarked on an adventure across the fantastical land of Artaria.  He became a soldier and fought in battle, journeyed the realm with a tribal prince and a wizened warrior, and mourned the death of a childhood friend.
All the while an ancient enemy From Beyond the Grave had crossed over to the reality of the living.  Aemellion, a mysterious man of impossible years, had emerged from myth and scorn to fight on the side of light and life.  And Anna, a woman from another World and another era, had crossed the stellar reaches in search of Lars.  
Now the story takes Lars into manhood and to another World.  But he does not go there alone.  Aemellion opened the Gate for Lars.  And Anna stepped with him.  There is Alikae, the former prince of Artaria turned Brethren hunter.  Gallion, the trepid and unfocused Elemantalist.  And Sir Sheldon, the Last of the Wyvernknights.  They will sail on the endless oceans and traverse the coldest mountains; they will meet new companions and confront old enemies; and as plans unravel and victory eludes them death may be the only choice that remains.
Epic in its scope and spanning Worlds, the Black Phoenix Cycle will take you to the nightfall of an interstellar civilization, and back in time to its pinnacle.  And through the millennia, two enemies will play out a game where the barrier between the living and the dead is ruptured and those closest to themregardless of love, loyalty, or sacrificeare merely pawns.
The Cycle continueson Camroon." />
