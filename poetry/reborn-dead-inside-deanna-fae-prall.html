  <title>Reborn: Dead Inside - Deanna Fae Prall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Deannas first book of poetry, she cronichles an approximate 6-month period in her life at the age of twenty-one where she battled addiction, overcame depression, and encountered many other trials and tribulations.
The book was left raw to some degree to reflect the honest pain and anguish she was experiencing when writing through all of this.
It is written in a revealing and honest light with hope for readers on similar paths near the end.
Reader Review:
&quot;I read your book today and found it to be very straight to the point
revealing the exact reality of your life. It touched my heart in many
ways. I found myself being able to relate to so many of your emotions. I
passed the book on to my mother and she has already said that she can
relate to it. I want to congratulate you on your success....on being able
to find the strength to overcome many obstacles in life. All I can say is
well done, my friend, well done.&quot;
