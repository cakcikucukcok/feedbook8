  <title>A Week in Paradise - Blair Erotica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A dream vacation goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Greg and Sherry spent all their savings on a sexy dream vacation in the tropics. When he threw his back out on the first day&amp;nbsp; it looked like the fun was already over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lena, who owns the bungalows, takes pity on them. She introduces Sherry to friends who show her a more erotic side of paradise than she&amp;#39;d expected, while Lena and a friend ease Greg&amp;#39;s suffering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lena, who owned the bungalows, took Sherry to the office to wait while the doctor examined Greg. Lena poured two glasses of clear liquid and handed her one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;White rum,&amp;quot; she said when Sherry looked at her curiously. &amp;quot;It helps.&amp;quot; Then she smiled. &amp;quot;You, not so much him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The doctor came in shaking his head. &amp;quot;I gave him a sedative,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The man is in some serious pain. It&amp;#39;s a powerful shot and will knock him out for forty-eight hours. After that, he should be able to start moving around gently, but he will have to quite careful for at least two weeks.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What can I do to help him?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head again. &amp;quot;Not much.&amp;quot; He looked at Lena and licked his lips. She smiled and poured him some rum and he sipped it thankfully.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lena knows the routine as well as anyone,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;She is a better healer for that kind of thing than I am. But it is all basic. Give him a sponge bath, so that he will rest comfortably, use ice and heat, and Lena&amp;#39;s special balms on his back. Then you wait. I will come back when the sedative wears off and evaluate him again, but I think it was just one giant muscle spasm. Sometimes tension builds up and when it releases, bang.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he left, Lena poured them each another glass. &amp;quot;I am so sorry for both of you,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;What awful timing, happening right at the beginning of your trip.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They downed their drinks and then went back to the room to check on Greg. He lay on his back, his breath steady but shallow. &amp;quot;We only have five days here, and he will be unconscious for two of them,&amp;quot; Sherry sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Was it your honeymoon?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sherry laughed. &amp;quot;Not really. We&amp;#39;ve been lovers for a few years, but he travels a lot for his work&amp;nbsp; doing construction. He isn&amp;#39;t going without sex while he&amp;#39;s gone, and I am not exactly sitting home alone either. We both understand that... I guess you&amp;#39;d call it an open relationship. But still...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded. &amp;quot;It was supposed to be a special time to be together?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sherry nodded. &amp;quot;Part of coming here was because of his fantasy of screwing me on the beach.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lena laughed. &amp;quot;I think that one is universal.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sherry grinned. &amp;quot;I guess so. I think he is also interested in having some fun with island girls. He loves variety, and I remember that he mentioned once, well more than once, that he has never had a black woman.&amp;quot;" />
