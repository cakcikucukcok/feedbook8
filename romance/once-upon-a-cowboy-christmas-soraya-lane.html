  <title>Once Upon a Cowboy Christmas - Soraya Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Billionaires, cowboys, and romance collide during the holidays in this next book in the River Ranch series!  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s the most wonderful time of the year at the Ford family ranch. Will one cowboy&#39;s homecoming be the greatest gift of all?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;He left town and never looked back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cody Ford is a Wall Street honcho with humble Texas roots. This holiday season, he&#39;d be content to just stay in New York and not face his family--and dodge their questions about when and with whom he plans to settle down. . .and if he will do so back at home. But his father isn&#39;t getting any younger, and Cody doesn&#39;t want to miss any last chances to see him and the rest of the folks back on the ranch. The last person Cody was expecting to see? His one-time girlfriend, Lexi Murphy, who&#39;s been working as his dad&#39;s new live-in nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She never forgot him. Can she ever forgive him?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lexi still holds a grudge against Cody. Back then, the college-bound heartthrob believed he was too good for a small-town girl like Lexi. But now Cody can&#39;t help but see her in a whole new light. Could it be that this beautiful single mother with an unbeatable can-do spirit is the one he&#39;s been waiting for all along? That depends on whether Cody can prove to Lexi that, this time, he means business--and if a sudden snowstorm can lend just the right amount of Christmas magic to help move things along. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Lane warms hearts of readers across the globe.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
