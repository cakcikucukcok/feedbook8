  <title>The Family Link to Education - Rex A. Holiday, Steve Sonntag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Family Link to Education: The Road to Personal and Professional Success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a source of information that is current and relevant for families, educators and communities that want to provide the best possible opportunities for the up and coming generations. Beginning with the family, the book gets right at the root of how the future leaders, entrepreneurs, and educators of our local, national and worldwide communities are molded by early childhood influences. The book offers many suggestions to those who (by right or circumstance) have dibs on the earliest intellectual development of children. After digging down into the family perspective of education, the book transitions to a more subject matter expert perspective on education and the educator&amp;rsquo;s view of education. The student is the focus of the second part of the book, and finally, there is a reiteration of an inescapable fact; families in their various kinds, sizes and formats are the foundations upon which our communities are built.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
