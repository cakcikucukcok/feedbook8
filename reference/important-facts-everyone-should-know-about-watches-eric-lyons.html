  <title>Important Facts Everyone Should Know About Watches - Eric Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="High quality watches typically cost a large quantity of money, and it is unlikely, unless the watch&#39;s owner is filthy rich and equally careless with his wealth, that an expensive watch will be tossed aside after a few years. The highest quality watches, from Rolexes to Bvlgaris, will likely be treasured for a generation or more. Even the highest quality watches, however, require regular servicing, which may mean a simple battery change or something more extensive, such as changing the rubber gaskets on a waterproof watch.
