  <title>This Mans Pill: Reflections on the 50th Birthday of the Pill - Carl Djerassi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="October 15, 1951 marks the birthday of one of the key episodes in 20th century social history: the first                       synthesis of a steroid oral contraceptive in a small laboratory in Mexico City - an event that triggered the                  development of the Pill. Carl Djerassi has been honoured worldwide for that accomplishment, which ultimately                    changed the life of women and the nature of human reproduction in ways that were notforeseeable. On the                       50th anniversary of this pivotal event, Djerassi weaves a compelling personal narrative full of self-reflection                       and occasional humour on the impact this invention has had on the world at large and on him personally. He                 credits the Pill with radically altering his academic career at Stanford University to become one of the few                       American chemists writing novels and plays.  This Mans Pill presents a forcefully revisionist account of the                       early history of the Pill, debunking many of the journalistic and romantic accounts of its scientific                    origin. Djerassi does not shrink from exploring why we have no Pill for men or why Japan only approved thePill                       in 1999 (together with Viagra). Emphasizing that development of the Pill occurred during the post-War                       period of technological euphoria, he believes that it could not be repeated in todays climate. Would the                    sexual revolution of the 1960s orthe impending separation of sex (in bed) and fertilization (under                       the microscope) still have happened?  This Mans Pill answers such questions while providing a uniquely                       authoritative account of a discovery that changed the world." />
