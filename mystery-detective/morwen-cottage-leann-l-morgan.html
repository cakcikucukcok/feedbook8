  <title>Morwen Cottage - LeAnn L. Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Rowena Mills had just gone through a divorce when she found a neglected certified letter on her kitchen table. She was astonished to discover her paternal great-aunt, a woman she&#39;d never met, left her entire estate in Cornwall U.K. to her. Without much planning, she sold everything she owned and boarded a plane to England.&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;Situated in the Bodmin Moors, the home, called Morwen Cottage was rundown from years of neglect. 
Rowena befriended an elderly neighbor, Manchester McGreevy, who lived alone across the lane.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to do repair work on the home, Rowena injured her finger that raced her to the doctor&#39;s surgery. This is where she meets handsome Dr. Harry Reader, the only physician in the village, and one-time partner to her deceased aunt. The doctor suggests a bloke to help her with the neglected cottage and sends a young man named Simon her way.&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;Curious as to why she, and not another living aunt, inherited Morwen Cottage, Rowena contacted a cousin via Facebook she hadn&#39;t seen since childhood.&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;After Rowena&#39;s arrival, a young waitress is murdered. And about the same time she encounters strange happenings in the cottage. When a second young woman is murdered, she goes to stay at Mr. McGreevy&#39;s house.&lt;br\&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;And to complicate matters, Rowena&#39;s ex-husband tries to win her back via e-mail. And by coincidence, she runs into a man she&#39;d met many years before on a dark, deserted highway.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;With only a four-month visa for England, Rowena needs to make decisions about the cottage, her future and the men in her life - if the killer doesn&#39;t get her first...&lt;br\&gt;" />
