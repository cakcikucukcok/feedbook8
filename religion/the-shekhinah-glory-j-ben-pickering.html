He is not obliged to demonstrate His power - but when He does it is for our benefit, to give us some idea of who He is, where He chooses to &#39;be seen&#39; and how tremendously powerful He is.  It is something that we have been denied possession of - denied by our nature a true knowledge of. For now we call it &#39;Glory&#39;. We must admit that we cannot really grasp this entire concept with a few simple words. So, in this instance let us put our minds towards exploring just one visual perception of glory - The Shekhinah Glory." />
