  <title>The Confessions of a Teenage Mystic - Mebo Nahdim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work is essentially the story of a young boy entering his teenage years, a shy, reserved, introspective, un-talkative individual.  For the first time in my life, I began to feel emotions that I didnt understand.  Poetry was a medium that helped me discover and explore these feelings that were so different than anything else that I had ever experienced.  Sadness, loss, happiness, love and hate among many others were some of the emotions that I was experiencing. 
As I struggled to come to grips with them, I found great therapeutic relief in expressing myself through written words.  I found that making the effort to put these emotions into words provided me with relief and solace.  The most important lesson that I have learned is that while experiencing difficult emotions, it is absolutely critical to never let those emotions be misplaced and to never allow myself to feel something without making an effort to understand that feeling .  
Throughout my life, I have never found the courage to share these thoughts and experiences with anyone.  Thank you for allowing me to share them with you and I sincerely hope that everyone who reads my poetry will find some inspiration (whatever it may be) and possibly derive some benefit for themselves." />
