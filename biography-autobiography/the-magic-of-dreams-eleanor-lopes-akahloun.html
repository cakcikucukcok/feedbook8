  <title>The Magic of Dreams - Eleanor Lopes Akahloun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Magic of Dreams:  An American Diplomat&#39;s Journey relays the story of a retired American diplomat who served in the U.S. Foreign Service for forty-three years. Eleanor L. Akahloun shares a remarkable personal and professional journey from humble, yet inspiring beginnings in her tightly knit Cape Verdean American community in Massachusetts. Her firsthand account of working with the U.S. State Department provides a peek into her colorful adventures and valuable lessons learned from her travels across all seven continents. This book is an affirmation that dreams are magical, that there is beauty amidst challenges in chasing them. The memoir is written in a question-and-answer format, with a perfect blend of wit, intrigue, and light humor. The Magic of Dreams:  An American Diplomats Journey is a fascinating read that will leave the readers inspired.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Fascinating Story about a Remarkable Woman, September 13, 2015 By M. E. Norris&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading Eleanor (Penny) Lopes Akahloun&#39;s memoir. It is a fascinating story about a remarkable woman. Ms. Akahloun, a Cape Verdean American, devoted 43 years of her life to serve as a career diplomat in the U.S. Foreign Service. She joined the Foreign Service at a time when the institution lacked diversity among its diplomatic corp. She overcame tremendous odds through perseverance, hard work, and a positive outlook-- characteristics which would help her tackle challenges throughout her life. Ms. Akahloun is someone who believes that we all have the capacity to enjoy life to the fullest. Her story is inspiring without being corny or unreal. Anyone who reads her book will take heart, no matter what their race, creed, gender, or age.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The format of the book is akin to a long interview. The author begins by relating her family background, including the astounding story of how her grandfather journeyed to America from Cape Verde. She also tells us about her parents, remarkable individuals who worked and loved hard, providing the author with a nurturing and disciplined environment. Most of the rest of her book is about her life and adventures in the various countries in which she lived and served. These included Morocco (where she met her husband), Uruguay, Kenya, and China. The author intersperses the story of her life with interesting information on the political and economic situation of the country in which she was posted as well as the U.S. foreign policy goals in the country. This makes for an enriching history lesson without bogging readers down in too much detail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hope that many people will read Ms. Akahloun&#39;s story and will be as strengthened and nourished as I was in reading it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
