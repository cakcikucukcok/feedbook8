&lt;p&gt;Irish migrant, Neil Gilmore marries Rosemary, who agrees to have five children, as Neils forbear had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor finds out that Neil is infertile and persuades Rosemary to have IVF. This is against Neils religious beliefs. So he is not told. Rosemary gives birth to five boys after regular IVFs using the same donor, who doesnt know about his own role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil finds out the truth. He fights for the annulment of his marriage. He is kidnapped in Brazil and two people are murdered. The church shows Neil an alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; He couldnt forgive or forget her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young wife of an elderly businessman leaves him and escapes to South America. The man plans revenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Parallel lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rome businessman fathers twin boys to a single Sicilian woman. He takes away one of the boys; marries another woman and they adopt the boy who never learns about his twin brother. The boys lives will cross with tragic consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The perfect crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Larkin, an athletic champion, meets the manageress of a jewellery shop by chance. She refuses to cooperate to rob the shop. Acting alone, Sean plans the perfect crime. . .   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Crossroads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An American woman writer has unexpected sexual adventures on her holiday in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rainy night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragic life and death of a Sydney man used as a scapegoat by everybody all his life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
