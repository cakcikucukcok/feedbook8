          &lt;strong&gt;Jake Armstrong had no intention of getting involved with his very sexy–and very pregnant–next-door neighbor…until the night she was attacked.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His only goal these days was recovering and getting back in the game, not playing bodyguard to the most vulnerable of victims. Still, leaving her to fend for herself was out of the question, especially once they learned it was her baby someone was desperate to get their hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they unearthed shocking truths about her baby&#39;s family history, Jake sensed something growing between them, an attraction that became more intense as her due date approached. He knew this tiny family had no place in his future, but walking away seemed impossible–and practically broke his heart at the thought….&lt;/p&gt;
