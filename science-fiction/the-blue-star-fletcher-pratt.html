Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t this glass of port suddenly boil and spout all over the ceiling? You&amp;rsquo;ve never seen a glass of port behave that way, but the molecules that compose it are in constant motion, and any physicist will tell you that there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why they can&amp;rsquo;t all decide to move in the same direction at once. There&amp;rsquo;s only an overwhelming possibility that it won&amp;rsquo;t happen. To believe that we, on this earth, one of the planets of a minor star, are the only form of intelligent life, is like expecting the port to boil any moment.&amp;rdquo;" />
