  <title>Robinson Cruose - Daniel Defoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Thus we never see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.” –from Robinson Crusoe
Robinson Crusoe, probably one of the most famous books throughout the world, is the first English novel and brought a huge success with it the first time it was published in 1719.
Daniel Defoe achieved literary immortality with Robinson Crusoe, in which he both challenged the social, economic and political aspects of England and created an absence of society, on an island in solitude.
The rest is left for Virginia Woolf to say: “Thus, Defoe persuades us to see remote islands and the solitude of the human soul. By believing fixedly in the solidity of the plot and its earthiness, he has subdued every other element to his design and has roped a whole universe into harmony.”" />
