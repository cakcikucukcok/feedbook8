  <title>An Extravagant Hunger: The Passionate Years of M.F.K. Fisher - Anne Zimmerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In &lt;I&gt;An Extravagant Hunger&lt;/I&gt;, time slows and is relished, and the turning points and casual strolls of M.F.K. Fisher&amp;#8217;s life are unwrapped and savored. From the Berengaria that washed her across the sea to France in 1929, to Le Paquis, the Swiss estate that later provided a backdrop for some of the most idyllic and fleeting moments of her life, the stories of Fisher&amp;#8217;s love for food and her love for family and men are meticulously researched and exquisitely captured in this book. Exploring Fisher&amp;#8217;s lonely and formative time in Europe with her first husband; her subsequent divorce and re-marriage to her creative sparkplug, Dillwyn Parrish, and his tragic suicide; and the child she carried from an unnamed father, the story of M.F.K. Fisher&amp;#8217;s life becomes as vibrant and passionate as her prolific words on wine and cuisine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Letters and journal entries piece together a dramatic life, but &lt;I&gt;An Extravagant Hunger&lt;/I&gt; steps further, bridging the gaps between personal notes and her public persona, filling in the silences by offering an engaging and unprecedented depth of intuitive commentary. With a passion of her own, Anne Zimmerman is the careful witness, lingering beside M.F.K. Fisher through her most dramatic and productive years.&lt;/div&gt;" />
