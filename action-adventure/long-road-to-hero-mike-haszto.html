  <title>Long Road to Hero - Mike Haszto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joe is your average guy, who has led an average life.  Or quite possibly, there could be more, much more.  But he would never tell anyone that.
     He possesses the talents of being in the right place at the right time.  Or does he?
     He&#39;s not afraid to speak his mind, no matter the place and the time.
     Joe is one of those magical guys who came from an era when the world was vastly less complex and complicated.  And while the rest of the world evolved in their way, he evolved too, but not in the same direction.
     He was born his own person, grew up his own person, and lived his life on his terms.  The people who engage in his life are as special as he is.
     Through the crossroads and intersections of their lives, everyone comes to the realization that it is, indeed, a long road to hero." />
