  <title>18 Poems from the Heart - W. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I  have  always  wanted to  create poems  of  feeling  and  love , pain  and anger  that  I  have  felt  in  life   I  would  like  to publish  them  and  make  a  life  of  writing  my  feelings  and  insights.  Some  insights are  born  of  problems  of  my  own  creation ,some  not.  One  insight  is  that  I  have   been  wanting  to  write  and  have  the  work  in  print  before  more  than  just  me.  If  most  of my  work  were  read  it  would  have  to  do  with  my  search  for  Love , and  my  need  to  be  committed  to  someone.  I  always  seem  to  be  involved  but  not  fully  committed .  I  ask  myself  time  and  time  again  am  I  incapable  of  being  committed  or  has  the  person  I  would  commit  too  come  and  pass  in  my  many  involvement&#39;s
At  this point  in  my  life  I  don&#39;t  know what  the lord  has  in-store  for  me  in  this respect , but  I keep  Hoping.  I  have   been   involved  with  some of  the  most  fantastic  Black  women  in  the  world  of  every  day  Black  women .  Light ones  Dark ones ,  American  Non  American  all  of  them Great. I  am  starting  to  believe  the  problem of  which  I  speak  was   not  with  them  but  with  ME." />
