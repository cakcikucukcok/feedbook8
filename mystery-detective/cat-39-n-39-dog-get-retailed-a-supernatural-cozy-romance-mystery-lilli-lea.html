  <title>Cat &#39;n&#39; Dog Get Retailed: A Supernatural Cozy Romance Mystery - Lilli Lea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alanna MacLachlin, has a well-guarded family secret. She is a descendant of Epona, the Celtic Goddess of the Horse. Resulting in all the women in her mother&amp;rsquo;s family are animal whisperers; as they age they develop new talents, never knowing which ones will surface or when. Telekinesis, clairvoyance, ghost whispering- anything is possible. Finding the time to understand and control them before they do damage is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Alanna&amp;lsquo;s store manager is murdered in the parking lot one night. Alanna and her many comical animal companions- a brainless tabby, her Machiavellian sister, an overprotective black Labrador, and an ex-pat British hound- try to help her Chief of Police father solve the murder. Sniffing out the killer&amp;rsquo;s trail leads to more deaths that are very close to home, and Alanna starts having psychically disturbing dreams giving her clues that only the killer would know.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Then her dreams start to include Derek Atherton, a very handsome long haired contractor that has a family secret of his own. He&amp;rsquo;s the seventh son of a seventh son and bares the birthmark of an ancient curse that his family refuses to talk about. Derek struggles with his fascination for Alanna and awaits the chance to get close to her. But the latent evil within him is stirring. He finally gets a date with her that ends up in the Emergency room. He feels his curse may keep them apart forever. Derek has to break down the barriers around Alanna&amp;rsquo;s heart while trying not to break the spell that his family used to bind his curse. When the final confrontation occurs between Alanna and the killer, Derek realizes his curse will either be their salvation or ultimate destruction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
