Though the basic needs of existence must be fought for and won with blood– each day alive means another chance to seek refuge and a better way of life in a hostile and brutal world, where hope still fires the human heart.&lt;/p&gt;

Ryan, Mildred and Krysty are captured by the baron&#39;s sec men and pawned into the cruel frenzy of their leader&#39;s grotesque desires. JB, Jak and Doc enlist the aid of outlanders to organize a counter strike–but rescue may come too late for them all. In the Deathlands, you are sentenced to your destiny from the moment of birth.…&lt;/p&gt;
