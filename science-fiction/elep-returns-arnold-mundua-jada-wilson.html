  <title>Elep Returns - Arnold Mundua, Jada Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elep Returns is the story of a tree, named Elep, which grew in Kandrian on the south coast of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea.  Elep relates its own adventurous story, blossoming from a seed to a very big tree, to it being cut down and exported as a log to Japan, from its transformation to paper, to its import as paper by Australia and then by the country of its origin, to be printed as school certificates. As a matter of coincidence, Elep, now in its new incarnation, has the proud privilege of displaying the academic excellence of the boy who used to relish its nuts while in the Amumsong village.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Written by a Forest Officer, this science fiction, profusely illustrated, brings to focus the various stages in the growth of a tree, and the working of the Forest Authority mechanism, from its export, and the pulping of the log, to its metamorphosis as paper in Japan.  The voyage of the log from PNG to Japan and then to Australia in the form of paper, provides a panoramic view of the places the ship passed through and the beautiful ambiance of Japanese ports and cities.  It also describes the distinct nature and skill of Japanese workers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Eleps tale, narrated in simple yet delectable way, and interspersed with suspense every now and then, keeps the reader engrossed.  In view of the educational nature of this novel, it should be essential reading for both the young and the old alike.  It is a must for every school, college, university and institutional library." />
