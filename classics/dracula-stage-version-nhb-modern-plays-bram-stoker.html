  <title>Dracula (stage version) (NHB Modern Plays) - Bram Stoker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A thrilling adaptation, by acclaimed poet and playwright Liz Lochhead, that stays refreshingly close to Bram Stoker&#39;s classic novel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Asked to adapt it by the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, she immersed herself in the book. &#39;After a sleepless night,&#39; she writes in the Introduction, &#39;my hair was standing on end, what with the mad Renfield in his lunatic asylum eating flies and playing John the Baptist to his coming master&amp;amp;#133; and with Lucy&#39;s description of her &quot;dream&quot; of flying with the red-eyed one above the lighthouse at Whitby, and Jonathan&#39;s &quot;dream&quot; of the three Vampire Brides&#39; advances upon him and of their being repelled at the last minute by the furious Dracula&amp;amp;#133;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&#39;This was before I&#39;d even got to the abducted children or &quot;the loving hand&quot; of Lucy&#39;s fianc&amp;amp;#233; staking her through the heart&amp;amp;#133; or that shocking rape-like bit where, with Mina&#39;s newly-wed husband Jonathan asleep in a flushed stupor by her side, Dracula, at her throat, takes his fill of her life&#39;s-blood&amp;amp;#133;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&#39;Still, what really attracted me to the story was Rule One for becoming a vampire-victim: &quot;First of all you have to invite him in.&quot;&#39;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ideal for schools and drama groups, this Dracula is all the more chilling for the respect it shows for Stoker&#39;s original nightmare creation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Liz Lochhead&#39;s version of &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;Dracula&amp;lt;/I&amp;gt; premiered at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, in March 1985.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&#39;Despite remaining faithful to Bram Stoker&#39;s original, Lochhead&#39;s version grapples with contemporary preoccupations: gender roles, the horrors of the 20th century, the battles between faith and reason, madness and sanity, democracy and aristocracy... an erudite revisiting of a primal myth&#39; &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;The Stage&amp;lt;/I&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
