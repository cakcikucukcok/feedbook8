  <title>Buddha&#39;s Principle of Relativity - Don G. Athukorala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why not try for yourself Buddhas Code of Practice  The Path to Purification for better health, peace and happiness
Wouldnt you rather try out now than wait until it is too late? The sooner the better 
I exposed this ancient teaching of the Buddha that lay unheard and unsung for over 1500 years to reveal that psychological aspects can have their physical effects  mind, body and stress.
Dont leave for tomorrow what you can do for yourself today

At the end of the twentieth century many neuroscientists are still arguing on questions like; what is this aspect of intellect and consciousness we call the mind, to produce a combination of thought, memory and emotion, to name just a few? 
 This book is a bold attempt to throw some light into solving this mystery. As a person with interest in Science and Technology it appeals to me as a very fruitful effort.  Please enjoy reading; you will find it enlightening!
