  <title>The Green Phantasm - George Robert Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Paul Clifton is the man behind the mask of the superhero called the Green Phantasm. Clifton meets a young woman whose name is Amanda Taylor. Then, on a camping trip, he discovers the source of his superpowers. After James returns home, he has an accident that gives him his supernatural capabilities and tries them out. Shortly, Clifton puts together a Green Phantasm outfit and takes on his role as the Green Phantasm every evening. He then utilizes his inherited capabilities to protect the innocent citizens of Philadelphia from any criminals and/or troublemakers he comes across. 
The toughest of these is the evil organization called X-Termination. It is headed by Doctor XT, who is assisted by Zapper, Zinger, D.D.T., and twelve others. X-Termination soon makes two major attempts to X-terminate the Green Phantasm. 
The bad guys then venture through Philadelphia looking for Amanda. The Green Phantasm tries to find either Amanda or X-Termination. The next night, the search continues. The Phantasm soon picks up X-Termination&#39;s trail, but Amanda ends up getting captured. 
In the final showdown, James has until midnight to rescue Amanda from X-Termination Headquarters, where he has lots to overcome." />
