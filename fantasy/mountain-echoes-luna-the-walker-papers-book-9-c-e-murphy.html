  <title>Mountain Echoes (Luna) (The Walker Papers, Book 9) - C.E. Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Joanne Walker has survived an encounter with the Master at great personal cost, but now her father is missing – stolen from the timeline. She must finally return to North Carolina to find him – and to meet Aidan, the son she left behind long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That would be enough for any shaman to face, but Joanne&#39;s beloved Appalachians are being torn apart by an evil reaching forward from the distant past. Anything that gets in its way becomes tainted – or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Aidan has gotten in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only by calling on every aspect of her shamanic powers can Joanne pull the past apart and weave a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It will take everything she has – and more. Unless she can turn back time…&lt;/p&gt;
