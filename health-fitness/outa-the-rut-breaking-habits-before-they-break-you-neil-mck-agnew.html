  <title>Outa the Rut:  Breaking Habits Before They Break You - Neil McK. Agnew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over 30 years weve studied people from all walks of life trying to break old habits  some succeeded, most failed.
Those who succeeded typically followed steps outlined in this book. 
You know from repeatedly breaking New Years resolutions that it takes more than will power and brains to succeed. We all have a very wise but mouthy little person living inside our heads - call them Tiny  who tries to tell us when were being dumb. Most of us have figured out how to muzzle Tiny. Well show you how to use your particular Tinys accumulated wisdom about you and your well honed ability to fall off the wagon. 
As Oprah said concerning a recent weight gain: I didnt just fall off the wagon. I let the wagon fall on me.
 In the beginning we show you how to make smarter resolutions. More importantly in the remainder of the book we show you how to keep them. 
	The last five chapters focus on trouble shooting, on showing you how to climb out, and stay out, of the rut after youve invariably slipped back in." />
