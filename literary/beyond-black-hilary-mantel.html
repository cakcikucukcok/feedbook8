  <title>Beyond Black - Hilary Mantel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hailed as a &quot;writer of subtlety and depth,&quot; Hilary Mantel turns her dark genius on the world of psychics in this smart, unsettling novel &lt;/b&gt;(Joyce Carol Oates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paragon of efficiency, Colette took the next natural step after finishing secretarial school by marrying a man who would do just fine. After a sobering, do-it-yourself divorce, Colette is at a loss for what to do next. Convinced that she is due an out-of-hand, life-affirming revelation, she strays into the realm of psychics and clairvoyants, hungry for a whisper to set her off in the right direction. At a psychic fair in Windsor she meets the charismatic Alison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison, the daughter of a prostitute, beleaguered during her childhood by the pressures of her connection to the spiritual world, lives in a different kind of solitude. She cannot escape the dead who speak to her, least of all the constant presence of Morris, her low-life spiritual guide. An expansive presence onstage, Alison at once feels her bond with Colette, inviting her to join her on the road as her personal assistant and companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troubles spiral out of control when the pair moves to a suburban wasteland in what was once the English countryside and take up with a spirit guide and his drowned therapist. It is not long before Alison&#39;s connection to the place beyond black threatens to uproot their lives forever. This is Hilary Mantel at her finest- insightful, darkly comic, unorthodox, and thrilling to read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
