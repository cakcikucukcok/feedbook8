  <title>Cooking &amp; Eating Wisdom for Better Health - Maria Benardis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cooking &amp; Eating Wisdom for Better Health gives readers all the tools and know-how needed to cook joyfully, with agapi (Greek word for unconditional love) and eat for longevity. It teaches you how to cook intuitively using ingredients that harmonise your body and mind. Cooking and eating will become a time to celebrate, a joyful experience, a time to connect with yourself, a time to awaken to new experiences and to heal. You can begin to explore and rediscover the farmacy of nature for personal healing instead of the pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first section of Cooking &amp; Eating Wisdom for Better Health begins with the ten ancient Greek wisdoms to adopt in the kitchen and when eating to ensure happy and stress free cooking. The ancient Greeks had an emphasis on cooking spiritually rather than stressfully. Positive affirmations are also included. Affirmations were used by the ancient Greeks to look at the world and life from a positive frame of mind and to promote healing within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second section of Cooking &amp; Eating Wisdom for Better Health features some key ingredients and their healing benefits noted by Hippocrates and other ancients that were used by them in their cooking and in potions to heal health conditions. Recipes are included to showcase the healing ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy eating and a healthy mind were the two key components practiced by the ancient Greeks to ensure healthy living and longevity - Let medicine be thy food and food thy medicine. The natural force within each of us is the greatest healer of disease Hippocrates. Many people during these times lived up to the age of 200 years old a rare occurrence now days. We all have the potential to live long and healthy lives and this book will provide you with the know-how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking &amp; Eating Wisdom for Better Health is an essential addition to every kitchen!&lt;/p&gt;" />
