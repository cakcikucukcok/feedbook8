  <title>Jacob’S Ten Great Attitudes for Getting to the Top - Philip U. Nkwocha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How did Jacob inherit the Abrahamic covenant (despite being disadvantaged by order of birth) and become father of the patriarchs? How did he become stupendously wealthy and prominent twenty years after he ran away from home with just a staff? 
The top is open to all, but not everyone will reach the top. This is a bitter but truthful pill to swallow. Factors like background, environment, education, exposure, connection, ability, etc., may contribute to this, but attitudewhich is the missing most essential attributeis what this book tries to address. 
You can learn and unlearn your attitudes. Through this book, youll get to know the ten attitudes that lead to greatness and those that surely culminate in failure, attitudes approved and disapproved of God, attitudes that worked against Esau, and those that worked for Jacob. Indeed, the top is for people with great and positive attitudes. And you can be one of them if you cultivate and practice the attitudes described in this book." />
