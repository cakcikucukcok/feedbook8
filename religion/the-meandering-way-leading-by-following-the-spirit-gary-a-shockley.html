  <title>The Meandering Way: Leading by Following the Spirit - Gary A. Shockley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How often do you feel overwhelmed by the pace of your life? These days it&amp;#39;s easy to work harder and harder, constantly pushing ourselves and those around us so that we and our congregations can be &amp;quot;successful.&amp;quot; We forget that our drive to succeed can prevent us from taking the time to stop and listen for what God is calling us and our congregations to be. This book is one pastor&amp;#39;s story of his journey from a success-oriented drivenness to a significance-oriented, meandering style of life. What you will find are reflections from a fellow traveler who is now less desirous of doing something spectacular for God and is instead committed to doing something significant with God--who is discovering a more grace-filled, Spirit-led way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book offers a contrarian take on the more popular practices of leadership found throughout the church today. Meandering leaders are attentive to the promptings of the Spirit. They are guides and mentors who patiently journey alongside those they love and lead. Ultimately, being a meandering leader is about being on a journey with God--personally and corporately slowing down the pace of our lives and following God&amp;#39;s Spirit. In the faith journey, we are not so much racing toward a physical finish line as we are meandering toward becoming all that God has in mind for us to be. This book is an invitation to journey into the depths of your own soul and to follow the Spirit&amp;#39;s lead in the next chapters of your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
