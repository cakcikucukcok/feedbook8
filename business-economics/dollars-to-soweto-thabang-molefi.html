  <title>Dollars to Soweto - Thabang Molefi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Reader
If you are reading this book, you are either trying out my book or have already bought a copy. Whether you are already an entrepreneur, an aspiring entrepreneur, or the supporter of an entrepreneur, read on. I had you in mind when I wrote this book. The book offers a window into my life story as an entrepreneur so as to enable you to recognize and identify with my experiences. Business can be rewarding and fulfilling, but some of its challenges can destroy you if you are not prepared to deal with them. This is especially the case if you focus too much on disappointments, rather than see beyond your current obstacle. This book offers encouragement and examples to help you to persevere and not give up on your dream. You will see and learn why setbacks and even suffering do not always come merely to injure, but can also generate insights an opportunities to enable you to achieve beyond your expectation. As you read and digest my lessons learned, I hope you will glean from my experience the resolve to climb mountains and reach beautiful valleys in your ventures. I hope you will find the courage to discover new oceans and experience the power of money and wealth." />
