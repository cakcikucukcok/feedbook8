  <title>BEYOND GOLD there is only grey - Writ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEYOND GOLD there is only grey&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;is the story of a fraud on a massive scale, involving credit cards, property and banking. As the recent Banking crisis shows, the World is vulnerable to these forces that surround us, using the instant responses of the internet to destabilise the whole system, and through it, us. The governments of the World explained it all away as just market forces, but then, they would say that, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t they? In reality, as shocking as it was, one man orchestrated our downfall. Despite the authorities&amp;rsquo; best efforts to stem the tide, the threat grows until it reaches the very heart of Governments all over the World. We see into the mind of the man whose apocalyptic plans threaten our way of life, as he negotiates his way through the pursuing pack of investigators, led by one man whose mission is to seek and destroy all that he stands for. We get behind the thoughts and motives of the two principal protagonists as they struggle for the financial future of the World. For those of us who want to know, this whole story is a blueprint of how real fraud works behind the scenes in all its fascinating but shocking detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Main Characters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chief: &lt;/strong&gt;The man who investigates the frauds, calm, authoritative, contemplative,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decent, thorough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan: &lt;/strong&gt;His assistant, very attractive and clever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McKay: &lt;/strong&gt;Another assistant, Scottish, tough, uncompromising&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Commander: &lt;/strong&gt;(his nickname), the author of the frauds, brilliant but flawed and unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lieutenant: &lt;/strong&gt;(his nickname), the Commander&amp;rsquo;s friend and co-conspirator; Tough,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;honourable, loyal, ex-SAS and convicted murderer of his wife&amp;rsquo;s killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
