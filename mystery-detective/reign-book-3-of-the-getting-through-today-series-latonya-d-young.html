      <meta name="description" content="Ocean knew that it didn&#39;t matter how far they fled, trouble would always be on their heels. No matter where they went the Hawthorne brothers were running from trouble.  And the choices that Ocean made to leave the agency to follow behind Xavier Hawthorne, only meant that she was always going to be on the wrong side of trouble as well.        As if hiding from the FBI and the CIA wasn&#39;t bad enough, now they were hiding from Ariana&#39;s deranged brother who wanted nothing more but to make everyone including Ocean pay for the damage that was done to his sister.  Losing Xavier was something that she could not fathom living through.  So if she had to serve herself up on a silver platter to make amends for what was done to Ariana in order to keep Xavier and the rest of her new family safe, then so be it, she would pay the price for their crimes." />
