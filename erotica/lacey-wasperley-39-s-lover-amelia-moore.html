  <title>Lacey Wasperley&#39;s Lover - Amelia Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by the scandalous classic Lady Chatterley&amp;rsquo;s Lover. Lacey, the daughter of a famous country singer and her socialite husband, Sebastian, have a perfect life; that is until he loses the use of his legs in a car accident. Devastated, they move to his family&amp;rsquo;s sprawling ranch in the Midwest to try to pick up the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The accident leaves Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s soul broken as well as his body. He finds solace in writing and soon finds himself showered with attention while their relationship falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Things go from bad to worse when Sebastian discovers Lacey is having an affair. To Lacey&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Sebastian encourages her to continue, but only if he can watch.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Things heat up when Sadie, a nurse with a dirty secret, and Damien, a tall dark and handsome gamekeeper arrive. Sadie helps Sebastian come to terms with his condition and his desires while Damien awakens Lacey&amp;rsquo;s darkest urges as a submissive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Damien&amp;rsquo;s teeth flashed at Lacey. &amp;ldquo;I will. We have one more thing to do. Do you think you can handle it?&amp;rdquo; Damien replied.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Lacey shook her head, giddy at the idea there was more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good,&amp;rdquo; he said and kissed her again. He took the ends of the ropes, still dangling from her wrists and stood up on the bed. He tossed the rope over the exposed rafters of the cabin and pulled, dragging Lacey to her knees. He adjusted the tension on the ropes until she had enough slack to allow her a generous amount of movement, but her arms were still raised above her head. He wrapped his strong arms around, cupping her butt cheeks and kissed her again." />
