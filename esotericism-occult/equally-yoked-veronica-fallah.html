  <title>Equally Yoked - Veronica Fallah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Equally Yoked Trust in Relationships for Spiritual Wellness What is it that brings us to an agreement with another person? Are our expectations, spoken and unspoken, made clear in our agreements to walk together? Journey with me on the development of being &amp;ldquo;equally yoked&amp;rdquo; and embrace the trust and relationships God gives you for spiritual wellness. As I embrace this path of writing wrapped with biblical scriptures on Equally Yoked: Trust in Relationships For Spiritual Wellness, my prayer for you is to own your truth and recognize those relationships in which you agree to connect throughout your life. By believing in God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit as the only validation for relationships we agree to walk together. Chaplain Fallah has certainly interacted with many people. I think this qualifies her to write about people being equally yoked in all phases of their lives. In this book, Chaplain Fallah gives us a fresh and different look at relationships, which include: our families, jobs, friendships, marriages and partnerships, and in our faith communities. If you are looking for a wise perspective on living life more equal, this book can be your guide. Mae Thomas, Care &amp;amp; Compassion Minister/ Children&amp;#39;s Church Leader, PowerShift Worship Center CCDOC&lt;/p&gt;" />
