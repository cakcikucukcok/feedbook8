  <title>Alvin the Rooster - Scott Holland, Kersly Minoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alvin and Friends Rainbow Stories
This story is about different animals that live on farms and that help children to learn to read and their colours and at the end, has a counting page to help them with their counting. I think this book will be one of the best ways the children get to learn how to read, what the animal is, and what sound they make, and best of all, they get to learn their colours.
To learn counting, colours, and reading in one book is awesome saves having heaps of different books to teach the children what they need to know, and the stories are funny for parents and also the children as well.
Starting to read with their parents from the time they are born right up to some adults that cant read, this would be a perfect book to learn with, and I hope it would not be frustrating but fun to read and learn.
I loved writing this book and have been having a great journey to this point.
Alvin the Rooster would have to be one of my favourites but have to let you read the book and see what story you like.
Alvin the Rooster, well, in the book he had lost his cock-a-doodle-doo; unfortunately, he couldnt do his job as a rooster was supposed to. The other animals and the farmer had to go and see if they could find it.
Where did Alvins cock-a-doodle-doo go? See if you can find Alvins cock-a-doodle-doo. Read the book and see if you can be the first one to find it.
Also to come out are the other books continuing from this first book, such as Daisy the Cow, Sally the Pig and her six piglets, Alex the Sheep, Rosie the Goose, Cowboy the Horse, and Jupe the Little Dog That Could." />
