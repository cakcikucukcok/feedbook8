  <title>The Jaded Truth - Rp Folsom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When Stanley Logan called on Nick to go to Mexico to find his son, Nick at first thought the old man was over reacting. This action adventure novel sends our hero, Nick Farrell, deep into Mexico to find Jack Logan, his missing friend. He not only finds his missing friend but much more, as together they discover and become involved in a conspiracy which involves the smuggling of very rare, very old, very exotic archeological artifacts. The fact that some believe these artifacts contain certain magical powers adds to their allure and makes them very valuable, valuable beyond money. The further Nick searches the more he uncovers and when he ultimately finds himself in possession of the Little Queen, he inadvertently becomes the hunted. He soon finds himself obsessed by this magical Little Queen and tries to learn more.  However, the more he learns the more danger he must face, and he soon finds himself hopelessly but voluntarily facing a violent world of smuggling, kidnapping, stolen military secrets and the CIA. Nick finds that he has put not only himself in danger but others as well, as he tries to solve a mystery that always seems just a little beyond his grasp. After chasing all over Mexico and into Southern California, the trail finally culminates at the beginning of time itself. As if by fate he is uncontrollably drawn to the ancient world of Maya astronomy, mythology, and superstitions in order to solve this mystery. He, as well, is challenged to learn the Maya truths they as pertain to the beginning of the world and the true meanings of life. The deeper Nick finds himself involved the more he wants to know, until finally he tries to learn it all. This journey to find the truth is more than Nick bargained for as he is taken on a mysterious path and transcends reality, as he knows it, to find new concepts and truths.&lt;/P&gt;" />
