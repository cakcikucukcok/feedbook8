  <title>Fire-Breathing Liberal - Rep. Robert Wexler, David Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a reason &lt;i&gt;The Nation,&lt;/i&gt; America&#39;s leading progressive magazine, named Robert Wexler the country&#39;s &quot;Most Valuable Congressman.&quot; It&#39;s the same reason right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh refers to him as &quot;disgusting.&quot; It&#39;s because for the last twelve years Wexler has been Congress&#39;s most outspoken liberal -- taking on George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Alberto Gonzales, General David Petraeus, and, when necessary, even his own party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Fire-Breathing Liberal,&lt;/i&gt; Wexler brings readers onto the floor of the House and puts them at the center of some of the last decade&#39;s biggest controversies. He passionately describes how he defended Bill Clinton from impeachment and how he stood up against the Bush brothers when the &quot;butterfly&quot; ballots in his Florida district wrongly decided the 2000 presidential election. He also offers an honest and brutal assessment of the Iraq war and explains why he has become a leader in the movement to impeach Vice President Cheney. And, with warmth and wit, Wexler shares some of the funniest stories from the corridors of Congress, including how he became &lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s most talked-about guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a remarkably candid first-person account of recent political history that shows government as it has rarely been seen -- by a Democrat in the middle of the storms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
