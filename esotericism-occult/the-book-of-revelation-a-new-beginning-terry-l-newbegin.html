  <title>The Book of Revelation: a New Beginning - Terry L Newbegin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Book of Revelation: A New Beginning contains the hidden secrets of Saint Johns Revelation, and as you know, it is one of the most debated and most difficult books of all the scriptures to read and understand because of the extreme symbolism tied to it. Man has always assumed the word of Gods prophets and their stories were indisputable just because of their eminence in interpreted them as being true. Man has forgotten the history of himself, Earth, God, the origin of the universe, and how the scriptures have been documented, interpreted, and strictly passed down by our ancestors and religious leaders.  
As symbolic as Revelation is it has nothing to do with the end days or even about a solitary Anti-Christ as we understand it nor is it about Jesus coming to save you. In truth, Saint Johns Revelation is your own guide showing you that you no longer need to look at yourself as a sinner because you have bared your cross, like Jesus, and now the time has come for you to ascend to a higher state of Mind. The book of Revelation: A New Beginning is a book that will help open the gates of your soul memories so you can become aware of your own divineness, and that you are a God too. 
My fellow Gods, what is coming to an end is the old ways of perceiving and understanding God. It is not that God is a mystery. It is you that is the mystery, and when fear is resolved within, you are then ready to open up to the hidden secrets behind the Book of Revelation that religions have kept as a secret for thousands of years, either on purpose or because of ignorance." />
