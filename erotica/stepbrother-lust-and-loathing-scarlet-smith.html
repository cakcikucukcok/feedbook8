  <title>Stepbrother: Lust And Loathing - Scarlet Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tanya thinks that Billy is kind of a jerk. Sure, her stepbrother is a devilishly handsome alpha male biker with the body of an athlete, and sure, she&#39;s always had a crush on him. But he also has an arrogant streak a mile long, and ever since their teens he&#39;s treated her like his possession.
But then Tanya bumps into Billy on a drunken night out, and things start to get interesting. Not only does Billy share her forbidden feelings, but he wants to give her a gift - a gift so taboo that it will change Tanya&#39;s life forever...
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
“Billy, why are you looking at me like that? What&#39;s your problem?”
He shook his head. “No reason.” His voice was slurred and I could tell he was drunk…far too drunk to get back on his bike. So much for my ride home. It looked like I was sleeping on the sofa. The stained, ash-encrusted sofa. Great, just fucking great.
I yawned. “Look, I&#39;ve had enough of this. You&#39;re acting all weird and you won&#39;t tell me what&#39;s wrong. I need to go and get some sleep, and you need to sober up. Is there somewhere I can crash? Do you have a spare bed?” I really didn&#39;t want to sleep on that sofa.
“My bedroom.” He jerked his head to indicate where I should go.
I frowned. “What about you?”
He shrugged. “I&#39;ll be fine here.” Something in his eyes made him seem angry, like he was somehow disappointed with me, but I had no idea why.
“OK. Night, big brother. Sweet dreams.” I left him lying on the sofa and went into his bedroom, closing the door behind me.
There wasn&#39;t much in his room, just a big double bed that filled most of the space. I climbed in, drawing the musty sheets around me. They smelled of him, and that only added to weirdness of sleeping in my stepbrother&#39;s bed. Once upon a time, I&#39;d have given anything to sleep in his bed, although preferably with him in it at the same time. But I had put all of that behind me now. At least, that&#39;s what I told myself." />
