  <title>The Apocalypse Ark - Peter Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;STARE INTO THE ABYSS AND THE ABYSS STARES BACK. . . .&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third Cross book, the immortal angel killer Cross faces his most dangerous enemy yet: Noah. For ages Noah has sailed the seas, seeking out all of God&#39;s mistakes and imprisoning them on his ark. Noah is not humanity&#39;s saviour but is instead God&#39;s jailer. But he has grown increasingly mad over the centuries, and now he is determined to end the world by raising the mysterious Sunken City. Only one person can stop him: Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apocalypse Ark is an epic chase around the world and through history and myth as Cross races to stop Noah from finding the Sunken City. He&#39;s joined by a few old friends, such as Alice from the Alice in Wonderland tales, and several new characters make memorable appearances as well: Captain Nemo and his crew of Atlanteans aboard the submarine The Nautilus; the sorcerous pirate Blackbeard, who has sworn revenge upon Cross; the devilish angel Sariel, whose sacred duty it is to protect God&#39;s Bible; and the eerie and mysterious Ishmael, who may be the key to the world&#39;s salvation-or its damnation. Cross must find a way to bring them all together to stop Noah or the world will drown in madness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
