      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A millennia-old prophecy was given when the Forbidden Ones were driven from Achar. And now, the Acharites witness its manifestation: Achar is under attack by an evil lord from the North, Gorgreal-his ice demons strike from the sky and kill hundreds of brave warriors in the blink of an eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Acharites believe the end is near.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One young woman, Faraday, betrothed of Duke Borneheld, learns that all she has been told about her people&#39;s history is untrue. While fleeing to safety from the dangerous land, Faraday, rides with Axis, legendary leader of the Axe-Wielders-and hated half-brother of Borneheld-and a man Faraday secretly loves although it would be death to admit it. She embarks on a journey, which will change her life forever, in search of the true nature of her people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This grand and heroic story tells the tale of one woman&#39;s plight to learn the truth of her people and change their hearts and their minds forever.
