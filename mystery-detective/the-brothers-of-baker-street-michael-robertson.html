      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The second in a highly original and absolutely marvelous series about two brother lawyers who lease offices on London&#39;s Baker Street--and begin receiving mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brothers Reggie and Nigel Heath choose 221B Baker Street as the location for their law office, they don&#39;t expect that their new office space would come with one huge stipulation, answering the letters sent to Sherlock Holmes, the most famous resident of that address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reggie is distressed because the love of his life, actress Laura Rankin (whom Nigel also adores), is gallivanting around with media mogul Lord Buxton. And while Reggie is working on a new case involving one of London&#39;s Black Cab drivers who is accused of murdering two American tourists, the letters to Sherlock Holmes are piling up. There s even one from someone who claims to be the descendent of Professor James Moriarty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a case that would have puzzled even Sherlock himself and a pair of brother sleuths more different than night and day, &lt;i&gt;The Brothers of Baker Street &lt;/i&gt;is sure to please mystery fans whatever their address.&lt;/p&gt;" />
