  <title>Tollins 2: Dynamite Tales - Conn Iggulden, Lizzy Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We return to Chorleywood, home of the Tollins, tiny creatures with wings who aren&#39;t fairies and are about as fragile as a brick wall. In three thrilling stories, they will face the trials of theater, radio technology, and . . . armed invasion. Luckily, there&#39;s only medium exposure to danger . . . such as when Sparkler catches his hand in a pair of pliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Romeo and Beryl,&quot; Sparkler discovers an old human book and decides to put on a play of a story that is filled with great love and even more shouting. At the same time, a new craze sweeps Chorleywood as dragonfly racing literally takes off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Radio,&quot; the Dark Tollins of Dorset invade in force, with a housecat leading the charge. Sparkler, Wing, and Grunion must find a way to save themselves, and possibly the cat as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &quot;Bones,&quot; the Tollins leave Chorleywood on a mission of mercy. The homes of the Dark Tollins are about to be blown up by humans! We will dis&amp;#173;cover the importance of hot tea and toast in such desperate times. As well as jam, obviously. Once again, it&#39;s Sparkler and his band of Tollins to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;" />
