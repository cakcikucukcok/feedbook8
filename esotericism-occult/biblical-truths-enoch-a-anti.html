  <title>Biblical Truths - Enoch A. Anti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1 Corinthians 2: 9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him is a verse in the Bible that has been sadly misquoted and misapplied amongst most Christiansif not the majority. Most Christians with this Scripture have created the impression that; they do not know what God has prepared for those who love Him. That is a very unfortunate belief because the above scripture has nothing to do with Christiansit is solely a reference to the prince of the world and unbelievers.
Biblical Truth points out the main difference between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world. It also differentiates between the natural man and the spiritual man.
BIBLICAL TRUTH: Knowing what God has prepared for Youseeks to bring out the truth in 1 Corinthians 2:9 and expound on it to let the Believer understand that The Holy Spirit reveals to those who love God, the things He has prepared for them (1 Corinthians 2:10)Blessed are your EYES for they SEE: and your EARS for they HEAR (Matthew 13:16). In Biblical Truth, I touched on the natural senses/organs of the human bodyeyes, ears and heart mentioned in 1 Corinthians 2:9 and how God through these senses, which has spiritual symbolism shows us (who believe) the things He has prepared for us. 
In Chapter One, I have expounded on 1Corinthians 2 to provide a background for the book. The eyes symbolic of Sight, Visions and Dreams: &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish . . . (Proverbs29:18a) is in Chapter Two. The ear in Chapter Three is symbolic of hearing from God: &quot;And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left (Isaiah 30:21) and the heart (Chapter Four) is symbolic of Faith; &quot;with the heart we believe&quot; (Romans 10:10).
The other Chapters, further explains how to put our faith to work and Chapter Seven which is my favourite Chapter speaks about Heaven-Our Glorification, which is the final work of redemption revealed by God." />
