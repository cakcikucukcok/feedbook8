  <title>Words of Life - Brenda Bouyer-Windley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Words of Life&lt;/i&gt; celebrates love and friendship in verse and shares in the life of someone who has been through life experiences shared by so many. In a world where there is such uncertainty and chaos, the emotions expressed in these poems appear in tranquil and peaceful words of the heart. The collection has been divided into three distinct sections: Love and the Heart, Strength and Courage, and Dedication. From the joy of finding love to the agony of discovering that your beloved does not love you, the emotions that this collection explores will not soon be forgotten.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is Love&lt;/b&gt;
Through the storm of diminishing life
There is love
Through the pain that cuts like a knife
There is love
Though there are risks you are taking
It is the time you are making
To create a love that will last
A remedy to the past
There is love
Do not look back, erase your fear
Hold the one you love close and near
Do not second guess your feelings
Hold on to your continuous reelings
There is love
Keep each other in your hearts safe and warm
Always let your love whether every storm
Repel the worrywarts and non-believers
Together, you will be the achievers
There is love &lt;/i&gt;" />
