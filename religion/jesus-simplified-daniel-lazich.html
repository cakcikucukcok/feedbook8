  <title>Jesus Simplified - Daniel Lazich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A new and thought provoking book “Jesus Simplified”, (or: Jesus’Mission Simplified) places Jesus where he belongs, in center of Scriptures.  While it does not try to unpack each seal, trumpet, and plague, it does provide compelling insight that resolves the difficulties associated with traditional approaches to interpretation of Revelation.  The chief aim of this book is to reassure the readers that Jesus Christ is who he said he was; the Savior of the world.  The readers of this book will find assurance that their future is secure in the hands of him who suffered the cross to give new and eternal life to all who believe.  Unprecedented and unavoidable troubles will soon fall upon those who “live on earth”; but those who have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb of God do not have to fear the future.  God is in charge.  The readers will also find assurance that God has, in Jesus Christ, accomplished everything needed for the salvation of sinners." />
