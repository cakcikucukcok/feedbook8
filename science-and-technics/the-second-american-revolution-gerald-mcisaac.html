  <title>The Second American Revolution - Gerald McIsaac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The focus of the book is on the revolution which is currently raging in North America, one which will break out into open warfare any day now, just as it did in 1776. It is a class struggle, the working class against the capitalist class. The capitalists are about to be overthrown and the working class will soon exercise dictatorship over them, in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This revolt will not be limited to the political arena, but to other areas as well, as they are all connected. That is the reason the book contains articles on various fields of science, not just the political.
I am a working class intellectual and a theoretical scientist. I am currently challenging scientific theories in various fields, including paleontology, anthropology, zoology, history, and political science.
These theories are presented as facts by the scientific community, and anyone who dares challenge these theories is not allowed to earn a living working in any field of science. That is the reason I perform this work as a sideline. I refer to these theories as scientific fairy tales, which does not endear me to the scientific community. I am writing these articles because I consider it my duty." />
