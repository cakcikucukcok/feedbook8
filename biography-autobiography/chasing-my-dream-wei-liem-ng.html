  <title>Chasing My Dream - Wei Liem Ng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wei Liem Ngs hobby used to be daydreaming. He dreamed about owning his own bookstore and including a library in his mansion one day. Most of all, Ng dreamed about writing a book. Sadly, daydreaming had a bad reputation and Ng was left following a career path he did not desire.
After Ng passed the extremely challenging exams to become an accountant, he details how he embarked on an arduous journey to look for work that included writing a rsum, interviewing, and finally accepting a boring job at a construction company. As Ng reluctantly immersed himself in the mind-numbing world of numbers crunching, financial statements, and audits, he began to reflect on whether he was destined for something better. With help from his close confidants, Yap and Ping, Ng reveals how he finally learned to see the humorous side of life and eventually summoned the courage to chase his dreams.
Chasing My Dream recounts the true story of a Malaysian accountants quest for happiness as he broke free from his insecurities and the corporate world and began a new journey to pursue his passion." />
