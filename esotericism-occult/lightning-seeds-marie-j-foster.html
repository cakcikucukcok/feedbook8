  <title>Lightning Seeds - Marie J. Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lightning Seeds&lt;/i&gt; is about formally acknowledging awareness within each and every one of us as we live our lives. It is about change and renewal. It is about intricately weaving feelings into your life. Helping to integrate, assimilate, and formalize feelings as the mainstream, where awareness is the norm, where spirituality is in the physical, not as something to be obtained through a misty veil at the end of a tunnel. It is a blueprint for change, a map, but not the territory. It is the nature of true reality, asking you what is your place therein. It is not about diluting the situations we may find ourselves in. The words are abstractions, a guide. As you open to any page, it is important to bear in mind what that page is making you aware of: a memory, a feeling, an experience, and emotions and attitudes that come with it. Do they still serve? See possibilities that change can bring, and with the purest intentions for your highest good, make a choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It challenges the view of seeing your life as being linear. It unfolds different lines. As you read, you choose your own ebbs and flows to follow your own spiritual path. The resonant and common thread is that we all contain light and love and experience change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simply cannot hope anymore that something will just happen; we have to be aware in our lives. We must all help ourselves. Sustain life from the inside out. We all have the knowledge, the means to ensure our survival by tapping into our soul, light, our lightning seeds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
