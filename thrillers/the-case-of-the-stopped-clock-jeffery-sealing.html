  <title>The Case of the Stopped Clock - Jeffery Sealing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After completing an eight-week speaking engagement run for his success in Grand Junction, Colorado, Daniel returns to his quiet law practice in Ironton, Colorado. With almost no cases going on and the bills piling up, Daniel is starting to get worried. Barry wants Daniel to take the case of his poor security officer, Bill Berman, whom after being shot by the bandit, is charged with their alleged murder. Daniel takes on the case and is once again up against the best that the 6th Judicial District has to offer. The evidence that is gathered seems to be all too conveniently pointing to the accused security officer. Daniel doesnt like it one bit and decides to use his resources to find the real killer. For Daniel the choices are grim for Bill Berman; life in prison without parole for First Degree Murder, 20-years to life for Second Degree Murder or 15-years to life for Manslaughter. Daniel doesnt accept any of the plea bargains offered by Linda. While preparing for the forthcoming arraignment, preliminary hearing and soon to follow trial, a terrible set of events befalls Daniel. See the conclusion of this case in The Case of the Missing Coffee Pot." />
