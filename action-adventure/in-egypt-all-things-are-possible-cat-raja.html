  <title>In Egypt, All Things Are Possible - Cat Raja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SYNOPSIS OF IN EGYPT, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
	Mizz Mamshad discovers she rediscovers her &quot;psychic abilities&quot; while tutoring at Cambridge University in England.  This ability helps her in her professional career as a tutor in Medieval History.  However, a dream one night impresses itself upon her in such startling clarity she cannot forget it, and decides to act on it.  The decision to do this takes her to Egypt to search for what she thinks is to find &quot;hidden books&quot; which will reveal why and who built the original pyramid at Giza.  At least, that&#39;s what she thinks she is searching for.  As in life, her adventure is of self discovery rather than a discovery of material answers.  But, along the way, some possible answers to one of the great mysteries of humanity are found in an old ruined site on the road that links the Nile across the Eastern Desert to Syria.  Of course, she finds a little romance and gets into a little trouble.  Like life.  And, like life, mysteries are introduced but not always solved." />
