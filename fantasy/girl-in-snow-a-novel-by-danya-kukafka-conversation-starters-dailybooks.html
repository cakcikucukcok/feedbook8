  <title>Girl in Snow: A Novel by Danya Kukafka | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Girl in Snow: A Novel by&amp;nbsp;Danya Kukafka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Lucinda Hayes is found dead in the snow, the small town of Broomsville, Colorado is shaken. Who could have killed the town&amp;rsquo;s beloved &amp;ldquo;golden girl&amp;rdquo;? Is it Cameron, the mentally unstable boy who obsessed about her? Or could it be Jade who hated Lucinda for taking away from her everything she loved? As the town wrestles with the truth, Russ, the police officer tasked to solve the murder is distracted by secrets and problematic relationships that resurface as he investigates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Described by Paula Hawkins, author of the bestselling The Girl on the Train, as an &amp;ldquo;incredibly accomplished&amp;rdquo; debut novel, Girl in Snow by Danya Kukafka is further praised for its elegant language, perfectly-paced plot, and well-drawn characters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
