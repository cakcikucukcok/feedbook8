  <title>The Call of Spiritual Emergency: From Personal Crisis to Personal Transformation - Emma Inc. Bragdon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A feast of revealing narratives expose the amazing story of how people deal with critical points in personal transformation, also known as spiritual emergency.  With the increase of interest in yoga, meditation, mental health recovery, and recovery from addiction there is renewed interest in care that is not based on medication as much as empathy and compassionate companionship.  This book helps anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t have a language to understand intense inner experiences and confuses them with mental illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have felt disoriented by intense spiritual experiences this book will help you understand where you are and where you may be heading.  It is a map of the journey of spiritual awakening written by a psychologist who knows the territory well.  Reading it may make the difference between heading off to the hospital to get drugs to stop the symptoms or staying home and knowing you are OK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just because you have had a conversation with your spirit guide, or talked to the spirit of someone who has passed away doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are having a breakdown.  It could mean you are having a breakthrough to a higher level of functioning.  The author is a psychologist and knows the territory." />
