  <title>Marine Stone Ii - Shatha Ghanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The lives of the Lava men change forever after Florences grand speech and with the possession of the magical stone Marine. But they arent in for a life of luxury and comfort  their destiny calls for something greater, for a purpose far higher than any of them would have fathomed. 
In the beautiful and serene village of Chess Squares, the arrival of Lava men is followed by morevisitors. And they are not pleasant at all. The magic turns evil and a war for the possession of the magical stone ensues. With the Witch of the Woods scheming and plotting with her allies and things spiraling out of control for the Lava men and their friends, the tale takes a turn  that of treachery, revelation of secrets, forgotten relationships, and the relentless drive to avenge at any cost. 
The misunderstandings, the revelations, and the time travel, all mark the the Lava familys time at the village of Chess Squares as a highly adventurous one where they not only try to protect themselves and Marine, but also embark on a tireless mission to help those in dire need at the village, using the special gifts bestowed on them.
The second part of the book introduces new characters and a few old ones who visit the village of Chess Squares, those that have met the Lave men or one of them in their earlier escapade, each destined to fulfill their roles. Some fall prey to evil and some manage to stand above all of it. The second part concludes on how love and compassion stands with steely resolve in the face of all kinds of evil and opposition, and how the truth prevails despite the armies mustered by falsehood." />
