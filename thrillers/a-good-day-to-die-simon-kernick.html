  <title>A Good Day to Die - Simon Kernick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Dennis Milne--now living under an assumed identity in the Philippines--hears that his old friend and colleague Malik has been gunned down in a restaurant, he decides to go back to the violent city he once called home and bring the murderer to justice. Milne arrives in a pre-Christmas London that is cold and hostile. But he is no longer a policeman; no longer charged with keeping the peace and upholding the law. Although his old friends at the King&#39;s Cross station do not know that Milne is back in town, it soon becomes clear that his arrival has been expected by men who are after his blood. Hungry for revenge and determined to uphold his own very rough brand of justice, Milne searches for the person behind his friend&#39;s demise--and leaves a trail of death and destruction more wide-reaching than even he could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
