  <title>Divine Perfection and Human Potentiality - Jarred A. Mercer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The place of Hilary of Poitiers in the debates and developments of early Christianity is tenuous in contemporary scholarship. His invaluable historical position is unquestioned, but the coherence and significance of his own thought is less certain. In this book, Jarred A. Mercer makes a case for understanding Hilary not only as an important historical figure, but as a noteworthy and independent thinker.
&lt;em&gt;Divine Perfection and Human Potentiality&lt;/em&gt; offers a new paradigm for understanding Hilary&#39;s work &lt;em&gt;De Trinitate&lt;/em&gt;. The book contends that in all of Hilary&#39;s polemical and constructive argumentation, which is essentially trinitarian, he is inherently developing an anthropology. The work therefore reinterprets Hilary&#39;s overall theological project in terms of the continual, and for him necessary, anthropological corollary of trinitarian theology- to reframe it in terms of a &quot;trinitarian anthropology.&quot; The coherence of Hilary&#39;s work depends upon this framework, and without it his thought continues to elude his readers. Mercer demonstrates this through following Hilary&#39;s main lines of trinitarian argument, out of which flow his anthropological vision. These trinitarian arguments unfold into a progressive picture of humanity from potentiality to perfection." />
