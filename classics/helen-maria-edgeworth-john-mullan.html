  <title>Helen - Maria Edgeworth, John Mullan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;She was the bestselling author of Regency England. Admired by Jane Austen whose fame she eclipsed and dubbed &#39;Our Great Maria&#39; by Sir Walter Scott. John Ruskin declared her work, &#39;The most re-readable in existence&#39;. Isn&#39;t it time we started reading Maria Edgeworth?&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Written in 1834, Helen was the last and most psychologically powerful of Edgeworth&#39;s novels.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Newly orphaned Helen Stanley is urged to share the home of her childhood friend Lady Cecilia. This charming socialite, however, is withholding secrets and soon Helen is drawn into a web of &#39;white lies&#39; and evasions that threaten not only her hopes for marriage but her very place in society.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;A fascinating panorama of Britain&#39;s political and intellectual elite in the early 1800s and a gripping romantic drama. Helen was the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s Wives and Daughters.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;This edition is introduced by John Mullan, Professor of English at UCL. John Mullan hosts the Guardian Book Club, and contributes regularly to Newsnight Review, LRB and New Statesman.&lt;/div&gt;" />
