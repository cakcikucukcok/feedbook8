  <title>Theology Reconsidered: Evaluating the Theology of Past Generations in the Light of Current Truth - Tim Hillis PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever noticed contradictions in Scripture? An honest, exciting, and relevant evaluation of the Theology we&amp;#39;ve been handed; Theology Reconsidered takes on the task of examining if what we have gotten is what Scripture really says. I don&amp;#39;t wish to tell you what to think, but rather how to think for yourself and accurately discern Scripture as it was intended. Some things strike us instantly and others take a while to be revealed like the dawning of the sun &amp;ndash; slowly the light is seen a little at a time. Our walk with our Heavenly Father is always growing and expanding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My heart is to see the Church-Bride rise up and each member of the Body of Messiah come to a place where they excel in every facet of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you desiring to walk in the miraculous and see people healed? Do you wish to increase in spiritual encounters with God? If you pour yourself into this material for yourself it will serve as a more than adequate launching pad for a lifetime of self-discovery in the Kingdom of YHVH which will never grow old, boring, or stagnant." />
