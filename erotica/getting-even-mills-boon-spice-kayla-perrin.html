  <title>Getting Even (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Kayla Perrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;For the past year, self-proclaimed Black American Princess Claudia has been planning her perfect wedding, destined to be the event in Atlanta&#39;s black society.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when her prince gets cold feet, she&#39;s stunned and humiliated. She&#39;s done things in the bedroom with this man that her mother would disown her for! Annelise is frustrated. How long can a woman go without getting some from her husband? The man she supported through law school, who she signed a prenup for. But it seems the man who used to want it all the time is still getting it. . . from another woman. Thank goodness their devotedly single friend Lishelle has a couch to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when The Guy Who Got Away in college reappears in her life, she starts envisioning a walk down the aisle. Ignoring her friends&#39; advice, she agrees to guarantee his bank loans for a new business. A girl&#39;s got to invest in her future husband, right? But once he gets his hands on her money, he disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a little digging, the women discover that the jerks they&#39;ve trusted have betrayed them in ways they&#39;d never imagined. As the scorned friends bitch over a bottle of wine, an idea begins to take shape — letting these weasels slink quietly out of their lives is too good for them. These women want revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
