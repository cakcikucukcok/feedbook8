  <title>The Truth of the Christian Religion, with Jean Le Clerc&#39;s Additions - Hugo Grotius, Maria Rosa Antognazza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Grotius&amp;#8217;s &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Truth of the Christian Religion&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; was first published in Leiden in 1627 in Latin. Written in a plain and direct language for his countrymen, this short work aimed to show those who would encounter pagans, Muslims, and Jews that the Christian religion was the true revealed religion. In addition to &amp;#8220;fortifying&amp;#8221; the beliefs of his fellow Christians, the treatise intended to convince non-Christians of &amp;#8220;the reasonableness of believing and embracing the Christian Religion above any other.&amp;#8221;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Editor Maria Rosa Antognazza suggests that &amp;#8220;Grotius claimed the superiority of Christian doctrine and morality and their perfect conformity with the teaching of the most enlightened reason, and at the same time he advocated tolerance for all positive religions. . . .
