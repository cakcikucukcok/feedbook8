  <title>Reigning Champions - Joel Ishler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why Should I Read This?
Every Man Needs a Coachs Playbook with Winning Strategies for Life.
This book was born out of a deep desire to see men everywhere experience victory over lust.
Lust made me lose out on too much in life for too long. My mind and my body were made 
slaves to lust. My relationships were broken by this problem for years. My life became a 
living hell trying to satisfy a craving that was never satisfied. It led me to emptiness, 
torment, and depression.  
Now that I have found freedom and how to reign over lust, I want other men to know that
they can do it too. That includes you. Whatever has kept you from having this freedom is not
important. What is important is discovering the tools with which to build a new life. I am
convinced that men dont want to continue living in bondage. We just dont know how to be
free. This book will give you the keys to living in freedom.  
In order for these keys to open up the door to life on another level, you must use them. That 
sounds so simple, but I believe that is where we fail. We must apply what we learn in order to 
see a difference in our lives.    
This is what Im asking from you: a commitment. Commit to press on even when you dont see 
immediate results. Commit to persevere even when everything in your mind is telling you to 
give in and go back to the same old same old.  
I dare you to step out of the boat and see the impossible happen. You can be free from lust.  
If you take what I show you to heart and then act on it, you will never be the same.  Are you 
ready to be a champion? 
Then lets get started" />
