  <title>Deflowering The Ginger Twins - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Arnold&#39;s always had a crush on his cute step-sister Serena, and she&#39;s always been happy to tease him. That is, until the day she asks him for a kinky favor. It seems her virgin cousins are finally interested in men, and they want Arnold to educate them on male anatomy. When he agrees, Serena makes him a deal: Satisfy the horny twins in whatever way they want, and she&#39;ll give him what he&#39;s been dreaming of since their parents got married!
EXCERPT
Vanessa gasped as my cock continued to thicken, and lengthen. I combed a few pubic hairs away from the shaft.
&quot;That&#39;s supposed to go inside me?&quot; said Carly. &quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Vanessa.
&quot;Well, okay, see? It&#39;s not...it&#39;s not too small.&quot;
&quot;What happens next?&quot; said Vanessa.
&quot;What do you mean? It doesn&#39;t grow wings or anything.&quot;
Vanessa giggled. &quot;No, I mean...what happens when you...um...&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; 
She twisted the hem of her nightgown at her pale waist. Beside her, Carly looked like she wanted to put her breasts away. &quot;When you...jerk off?&quot; said Vanessa.
Good question. I looked to Serena and she tried to feign innocence. &quot;What happens?&quot; I said. 
&quot;Did I not mention the girls wanted to see that?&quot; said Serena.
&quot;Oh, did you not mention-?&quot; I laughed. &quot;What, you want me to masturbate?&quot; 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; said Vanessa.
&quot;Well of course I don&#39;t have to,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; What was I? I was more turned on than I expected. Even without seeing the girls&#39; naughty bits I was comfortable here now, and my cock was stiff in my hand. Not as stiff as it could be, though. I knew it could get harder than this, bigger than this... Was it really going so much farther to rub one out for the girls?
&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Carly repeated.
But I&#39;d already made up my mind. Why waste a perfectly good erection? And as long as Vanessa kept shooting me those hungry looks (and Serena kept stealing furtive glances from my crotch to my eyes), I could do it. &quot;Okay,&quot; I said. &quot;You want it, you got it.&quot; 
I went to the chair by Serena&#39;s nightstand, took the purse or whatever bag it was off the seat, and scooted it forward. Then I sat in it and took my cock in hand. 
Carly, as expected, frowned. She crossed her arms over her bare breasts. &quot;I don&#39;t think we should.&quot;
&quot;Lighten up,&quot; said Vanessa. Then, to me, &quot;What do you want us to do?&quot; 
&quot;I can think of several things I want you to do,&quot; I said. &quot;But you can sit closer to me, to start.&quot;
Vanessa crawled forward on the carpet. &quot;Do you just rub it?&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot; I gently rubbed up towards the head. 
Vanessa was fascinated. &quot;What...things do you want me to do?&quot;
&quot;Well I mean...I was just joking...&quot;
&quot;Like sex?&quot;
I swallowed. &quot;Uh, like sex, but...there&#39;s...other things...&quot;
Carly groaned. &quot;Vanessa...&quot;
&quot;Shut-up, I want to know.&quot; She looked up at me. &quot;Can I touch it?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said. &quot;Oh yeah.&quot; I slid my grip down to the base and pointed the bulbous cockhead at her.
She reached forward, tentative. With her thumb and index finger she lightly clutched at the head, and gave a terrified little laugh as it twitched. &quot;Does that feel good?&quot;
It felt amazing.
&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; said Carly.
Vanessa ignored her. She slid her thumb and index finger down my shaft, squeezing as she went. &quot;It feels weird,&quot; she said. &quot;Rigid, but...soft, springy. I can feel...the veins...&quot; As her fingers slid down they met mine at the base. Then she slid her hand back up.
&quot;There&#39;s...something coming out,&quot; she said. A light drop of clear precum had pooled in my slit." />
