  <title>Dancing with the Ten Thousand Things - Tom Balles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each day calls us to tend life beyond ourselves. &lt;I&gt;Dancing with the Ten Thousand Things&lt;/I&gt; helps you answer that call and become a more powerful healing presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the innate ability to be a healing presence. Imagine amplifying your gifts and applying them in your family life, friendships, work, organizations, and community. Transforming care and compassion into effective action will become your way of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book outlines the journey of waking up through being of service. You will observe two changes taking place: less unnecessary suffering and greater possibilities in the life you share with others. You will learn to consciously tend to life one moment at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Balles has gathered his years of study in a variety of traditions and offers them as a gift. He succeeds in blending the richness of the deep wisdom traditions with daily practices to enhance your learning. This is very rich food for the body, mind, and soul. Take the time to digest this feast slowly over the days, weeks, and months ahead.&lt;br&gt;
