      <meta name="description" content="Lucy knows there is something wrong with the psychiatric home she&#39;s been taken to. She&#39;s noticed that she seems to be the only patient there. She&#39;s noticed all of the empty rooms and the fact that every door to the outside world is locked. She&#39;s also noticed how strangely her doctor is acting. It&#39;s as if he&#39;s pushing her for information-but information about what? Gabriel knows that all the answers are in Lucy&#39;s head, but she&#39;s refusing to find them for him. He&#39;s trying to keep calm. He&#39;s trying to give her time, so that she can discover her memories on her own. But when she starts to cause trouble he knows that there&#39;s only one thing he can do. Will Lucy survive Gabriel&#39;s desperate attempt to get the answers?" />
