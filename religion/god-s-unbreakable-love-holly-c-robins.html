  <title>God’S Unbreakable Love - Holly C. Robins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After being abandoned by her father, Holly is kept in a room for almost two years by the very people who were trusted to take care of her. The unbearable abuse, loneliness, and heartbreak of her fathers betrayal sends Holly down a road of brokenness and self-destruction for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Holly walks us through those years, many of you will experience at least one chapter that will describe your own pain. Gods Unbreakable Love is not just the story of one woman, but a story that has been passed down throughout history. It is the story of a powerful love and devotion that God has for his daughters and how far he will go to save them. Let God show you what he can do with your life when you surrender it over to him as Holly did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God cannot and will not fail you. God is the master healer of broken hearts and shattered lives. God never grows tired of rebuilding the broken because his greatest passion is his children and to see them live life abundantly. It doesnt matter what choices you have made in your life or what you have said or done. Gods love is unbreakable, and he wants to diminish your pain and redirect your life, if you will only reach out to him through Jesus Christ. It is a story of hope and victory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
