  <title>Finding Franklin - Katie Shands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a personal tragedy, Charlotte Clark returns to Franklin, Tennessee, the Southern town where her mother abandoned her as a newborn. Haunted by unanswered questions and an unrelenting desire for roots, Charlotte purchases a dilapidated Victorian near the historic downtown and sets out to solve the mystery of her birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin Hamilton, a skilled craftsman and house-flipper, sets his sights on Charlotte after she moves in down the street from the Craftsman bungalow he is restoring. Though Charlotte is a bit standoffish, he offers to help with some handyman projects at her house, and the pair forges an unlikely bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they work together, they uncover another mystery behind a wall in Charlotte&amp;rsquo;s home&amp;mdash;a diary penned by a woman who disappeared from the small town decades ago. Within the diary&amp;rsquo;s pages, Charlotte believes she has found answers to the lifelong questions about her own past. The only problem&amp;mdash;someone wants those secrets to remain buried and would kill to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Charlotte is faced with a reality much different than what she had envisioned, she must decide what the past means for her present.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Finding Franklin&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;explores the nature of family and demonstrates how God can transform our greatest tragedies into lessons of love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
