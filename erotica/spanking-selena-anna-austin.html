  <title>Spanking Selena - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At St Severine&amp;#39;s School for Turbulent Girls, young ladies between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one are sent receive the discipline they so desperately require...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Selena is eighteen, and is already wed. But she is simply too shy to perform her wifely duties. In frustration, her husband sends her to St Severine&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon entering the building itself, my eyes were instantly assaulted by the absolute perversion of it all. The halls were flooded with girls like Elizabeth - girls with ample chests, girls who wore their skirts far too high, girls whose brassieres were visible through their small blouses. It was too much for my delicate sensibilities - I had to avert my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elizabeth giggled, noticing my obvious discomfort. She led me up a flight of stairs, and I marveled at the fact that even though she was naught three steps ahead of me, I could still catch glimpses of her panties. It seemed wrong, somehow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, Selena. You&amp;#39;ll get used to the way things work around her in no time!&amp;quot; She insisted, though I wasn&amp;#39;t exactly inclined to believe her. &amp;quot;The uniforms are a bit unique, sure - and so are the punishments. But it&amp;#39;s really a lovely school, trust me on that. You&amp;#39;re sure to have a fulfilling experience here!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elizabeth chattered away about how lovely St. Severine&amp;#39;s was, but my brain was still stuck on that one word - punishment. So this boarding school had unique punishments, so unique that Elizabeth felt they were worthy of mention? In most schools, you had to write lines, complete extra work...or, in the worst cases, your hands were slapping with a ruler." />
