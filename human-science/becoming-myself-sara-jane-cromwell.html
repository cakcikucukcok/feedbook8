  <title>Becoming Myself - Sara Jane Cromwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The courageous story of Sara-Jane and her triumphant journey to find her true self&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A story of genuine victory despite the most incredible of odds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born into a family of twelve children in Ballyfermot, Dublin, Thomas had a childhood full of bullying and humiliation. All the time Thomas was hiding a dark secret that was buried so deep, not even he understood it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to fit in, he looked for answers in religion, work, even marriage. But through his struggle and despair he reached rock-bottom and eventually tried to take his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of good friends and much soul-searching, Thomas was able to have confirmed what he had somehow always known &amp;ndash; that he had been born in the wrong body and that he was actually a woman. The medical diagnosis of gender identity disorder &amp;ndash; a physical and neurological condition &amp;ndash; has allowed Thomas to step out of the shadows and to face the world at last as Sara-Jane, the person he truly was all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brave, humorous and powerful, Sara-Jane’s story is one of momentous personal change set against the backdrop of a changing Ireland, an Ireland now ready to embrace the growing visibility of LGBT voices in politics and preparing for the Marriage Equality Referendum in May 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In sharing her powerful story of gender identity disorder with honesty, compassion and humour, Sara-Jane Cromwell is a living example of triumph over overwhelming odds, and of a rare courage which will give hope to many, and inspiration to all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
