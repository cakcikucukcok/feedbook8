  <title>The Jacksonville Norsemen Society or Tyranny and Reprisal - Orlo James Goodson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you have ever had a boss you did not care for, you will appreciate The
Jacksonville Norsemen Society or Tyranny and Reprisal, a fictitious story about
two rival social clubs: the Jacksonville Jackalopes comprised of the upper crust
business owners and the Jacksonville Norsemen Society (a good old boys club)
comprised of the working man and woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friction between the two clubs focuses on a large horn that hangs on the
porch of the Jacksonville Norsemen Societys Lodge. The horn is used to call out
and inform the members when the lodge is open. The Jackalopes detest the horn
and have made several unsuccessful attempts to buy, steal or outlaw the use of it.
Finally, out of desperation, the Jackalopes decide to infiltrate the Norsemen with
one of their own. The infiltrator is to encourage the Jacksonville Norsemen to use
credit. Once the debt load is so high that there is no way they can pay the bill the
Jackalopes will foreclose and shut down the Jacksonville Norsemen permanently
and get rid of that horn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Demand Deville, the owner of the Mountain High Chemical Company,
which employs a large percent of the Jacksonville Norsemen, who rules his
business like a tyrant, volunteers to use his clout to force entry into the rival club.
The Norsemen reluctantly agree to allow a six month trial membership for Mr.
Deville  after an initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Norsemen get wind of the developing plot the Jackalopes
have named Operation Sink the Norsemen. Rather than canceling the entry of
Mr. Deville, they decide to use the initiation as a way to get even. Not only for
the dirty trick planned by the Jackalopes, but for all of the years of his tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenge can be so sweet. What would you do to your boss if you thought you
could get away with it?
Climb on board and enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;" />
