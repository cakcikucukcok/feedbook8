  <title>Sizzle and Burn - Alexis Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alexis Grant brings you the first in an explosive new series featuring the dedicated, deadly, and dangerously sexy Men of Delta Force.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mia Santiago has fought long and hard to become an expert in weapons technology. But her successful career didn&#39;t come without sacrifices, namely Ryan Mason, the only man she&#39;s ever loved. When she and Ryan chose their careers over a relationship together, she thought their goodbye was for forever.  So running into him at a conference is both a dream come true and a disturbing distraction--how can she focus on presenting her research when the man who&#39;s haunted her dreams for years is suddenly close enough to touch?     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing Mia is Ryan&#39;s one regret in a lifetime of dangerous risks, even if he knows the work he&#39;s done around the world as a member of the military&#39;s elite fighting unit, Delta Force, has saved countless lives. Now he has to keep Mia from the terrorists bent on using her research for catastrophic violence--and bent of kidnapping her and inflicting unspeakable harm upon the one woman he&#39;s never been able to let go. But outrunning danger isn&#39;t easy when the fire between them can&#39;t be put out. And this time, their future together is a matter of life and death...&lt;/p&gt;" />
