  <title>Every Single Day - Bradley Charbonneau, John Muldoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brendan Burchard said, &amp;quot;You need, more than anything else, &lt;strong&gt;daily momentum&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#39;s the secret of all life happiness.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Secret of all life happiness?&amp;quot; Sign me up! Just a little &amp;quot;daily momentum&amp;quot;? No problem, right? I got this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh. Today? Yeah, right. Today&amp;#39;s not really going to work for me. Could we start my life tomorrow? Say, around noon?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life gets in the way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you got in the way of your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you could steer your life in the direction you desired with just a small amount of effort delivered every day? What if that effort got easier and easier and the results got better and better? What if there were &amp;quot;side effects&amp;quot; down the road that were glorious and unknown and possibly beyond what you might have ever imagined?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Deliciousness to my soul, is the description that comes to mind as I reflect on my experience of consuming this book. I have no idea how to put into words how deeply this resonated within me.&amp;quot; -- P.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a spark inside of you that is dwindling? Maybe it&amp;#39;s hiding. Maybe you&amp;#39;re hiding. But I know it&amp;#39;s there. You know it&amp;#39;s there. Are you ready to relight it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;a spark within me that has been relit&lt;/strong&gt;. I know ESD is the kindling I need to get the fire crackling and roaring... there are flames here that need to breathe and light the world.&amp;quot; -- Peggy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s inside of you that you would like to set free? What dream or desire or lifestyle are you not living?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After reading this book, there is no going back. I have no choice. I make artwork everyday and &lt;strong&gt;I am happy&lt;/strong&gt;. I have only been doing it for a week but, I know &lt;strong&gt;there is no going back&lt;/strong&gt;. I was miserable with guilt and now I am not. I was afraid to create and now I happy to learn once more.&amp;quot; -- Paige&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change doesn&amp;#39;t have to be painful. It might even be small and, dare I say it: fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Charbonneau&amp;rsquo;s every man approach and aw-shucks humor delivers &lt;strong&gt;life-altering concepts&lt;/strong&gt; and baby spoon servings.&amp;quot; -- Sabin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are you on the path ahead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am at a cross roads ... the road behind me was filled with procrastination and not getting things done ... I want the road ahead of me to be filled with better time management and action. This book was just what I needed to get on the right path. -- Julie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a gift to help someone&amp;#39;s life move forward, have you thought about ... yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Time goes by anyway, why not start now! His easy, flowing, conversational-style makes this book a great gift for anyone - especially yourself.&amp;quot; -- Sandi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is a good day to start the rest of your life? How often would you like to be that person you want to become? Oh wait, wait! I know: Every Single Day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
