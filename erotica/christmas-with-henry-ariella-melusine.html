  <title>Christmas with Henry - Ariella Melusine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
After a terrible break-up, Lana is desperately in need of some Christmas cheer, so she goes to her brother&amp;#39;s home. The sanctuary she&amp;#39;d hoped for is soon broken, and the holiday spirit drifts away when a cruel tormentor begins a sick game! She and her brother are forced to play, and losing is not an option if Lana wants to not only enjoy Christmas but also put the ghosts of her past behind her&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Henry was speaking to one of the bartenders. When he was done, he walked over to me. &amp;ldquo;You okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So far, so good. Although I&amp;rsquo;m having a hard time not thinking about Joe and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know.&amp;rdquo; Henry&amp;rsquo;s hand reached over the bar and patted mine. &amp;ldquo;I told you we&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out. In the meantime, why don&amp;rsquo;t you take a seat and have a drink? It&amp;rsquo;ll calm you down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get drunk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not going to get drunk, Sis.&amp;rdquo; Henry&amp;rsquo;s eyes lit up a moment later. &amp;ldquo;I just had an idea. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t have a band tonight, you can sing a few Christmas songs. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to get into the whole holiday spirit. Don&amp;rsquo;t you agree?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That might be fun, but who would accompany me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hmm.&amp;rdquo; He looked at the ceiling for a moment. Then, turning back to me with a big grin on his face, he said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do it. I still play the guitar, and you know I have a few Christmas songs in my repertoire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is your guitar here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have one lying around in my office.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, yeah, I saw that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before I could say anything else, he said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get it. Then we can get this Christmas party started.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you say so.&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help laughing. Henry always knew how to get me out of my dark moods. I followed him to his office, and when he had shut the door, he did something totally unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled me into his arms and began kissing me. As our lips pillowed each other&amp;rsquo;s, his hands strayed under my shirt, making me feel as if my skin was scalded with thousands of jolts of electricity. When his fingers slid under my bra, I felt my insides heating up, and when they began playing with my nipples, I let out a low moan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ah, you feel so good,&amp;rdquo; my brother whispered. His lips slithered down my face, tasting my neck, and his fingers continued to play with my nipples. I closed my eyes, allowing the pleasure to overtake me. I was so close to coming, but a moment later, I heard Henry whisper, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be right back. Let me just check on a few things. Then you&amp;rsquo;re all mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He walked out of the office, leaving me gasping for air." />
