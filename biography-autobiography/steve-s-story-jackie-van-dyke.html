  <title>Steve’S Story - Jackie Van Dyke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A young woman and a young man left their villages in Poland in 1907 and joined the throng of immigrants pouring into the Untied States at that time. They met in Philadelphia and married soon after. Within fifteen years, hard times and a houseful of seven children led to a family breakdown, bootlegging, and arrests, which culminated with the children being placed in an orphanage.
This is the story of how one of those children, Steve, longed to find his family and home, as he imagined it could be. He ran away from foster care and eventually reconnected with his family. 
Steve survived four and a half dark years while serving in the army in WWII before he was finally free to marry his sweetheart. After an adventurous life, raising five children, and overcoming heartbreaking circumstances, Steve, at eighty, made a trip to Poland to discover his Polish family and true Polish roots." />
