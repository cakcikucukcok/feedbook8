  <title>LEIF ERIKSSON - José Arturo Ortega Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This historic novel tells the story of how the legendary Erik the Red led his men to a land of plenty where they built a nation: Greenland. Later, Leif, like his father before him, will also guide his people to a sweeping and much more bountiful land which, centuries later, would come to be called America. It is a tale of the challenges of that savage and indomitable world, as well as their struggle against nature and, above all, the Algonquin. Arturo Ortega Blake sets out their customs, dress, and mythology, and even their codes of honor, world view and social structure with mastery. Based on exhaustive research, this novel grips the reader with suspense. The story is embellished with the sentiment and values of a far off world which possesses the seduction of fantasy and excitement of the epic tale of the first Europeans to arrive on the new continent.&lt;br&gt;" />
