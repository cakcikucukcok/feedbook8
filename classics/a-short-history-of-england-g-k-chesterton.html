  <title>A Short History of England - G.K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="G.K. Chesterton was a prolific writer on many topics. His views of history were always from the standpoint of men and their interactions, and it may fairly be said he saw all of history as a battle between civilization and barbarism. So it has always been, and that remains true even today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But it is especially in the matter of the Middle Ages that the popular histories trample upon the popular traditions. In this respect there is an almost comic contrast between the general information provided about England in the last two or three centuries, in which its present industrial system was being built up, and the general information given about the preceding centuries, which we call broadly medieval.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As this quotation taken from the Introduction clearly shows, he is no mere pedant reciting dry dates and locations, but a profound thinker flooding new light onto those modern &amp;quot;myths&amp;quot; that have filled our histories. He is a master of paradox, and the technique of reducing his opponents&amp;#39; arguments to the logical absurdity they have inherent in them. He often turns them upside down. All of which makes his work both a sound subject for reflection and highly entertaining all the while it remains permanently timely." />

Chesterton was one of the towering figures of British literature in the early twentieth century. A man of massive size, massive personality, and massive appetite, Chesterton famous personality, dress, and personality gave rise to an eponymous adjective: Chestertonian.<br /><b><i>A Short History Of England by G.K. Chesterton</i></b> | Chesterton casts his Catholic eye back upon English history as England struggled with the crises made manifest in WWI. He finds sadly an absence of awareness of what was lost as European Christendom was laundered apart into nation states and Catholic civilization splintered into Protestant and anti-Reformation camps.<br /><b><i>A Short History of England: Chesterton, G.
