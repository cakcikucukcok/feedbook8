      <meta name="description" content="Its 1942 and the United States is deep into World War II. At home, amid adjustments to the hardships and heartaches of war, Kay Ann Franklin is losing a lonely battle caring for her terminally ill mother and her five-year-old twins, one stricken with polio and the other with chicken pox. Worried and exhausted, she has little left to give her baby daughter and her war-absorbed husband. When a colored girl appears at her back door offering to help, Kay Ann welcomes her but holds slight hope that the tiny, crippled Say can make a difference in their situation.
To her surprise, the teenager brings reinforcements for the battle and lightness to their burdens. The family also discovers Says exceptional musical talent and begins to envision more than the girl can grasp. Kay Anns dream of a college education for Say is sidetracked by a brutal attack and malicious opposition from neighbors, friends, and Says preacher. 
In this historical tale, Kay Ann and an unlikely group of lady warriors embark on an unforgettable journey during the chaos of a world war endeavoring to help an underprivileged teenager achieve more than she ever imagined, and, most importantly, to believe in herself.
