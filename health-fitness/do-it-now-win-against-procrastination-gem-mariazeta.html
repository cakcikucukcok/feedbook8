      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever been in a situation wherein no matter what you do, you never seem to be able to get your work, chores, or projects done? It can happen to the best of us and it&#39;s a hard habit to break.   Living for weeks with your pending task in mind can be tough and stressful. You promise yourself and those around you that you&#39;ll get started right away but for whatever reason, somehow, you still waited until the last minute.   Time is money. Can you imagine how much it would be worth to you, your company, and your future goals if you could cut out hours of procrastinating from your life? How much do you make an hour? And how many hours do you spend wasting time with a deadline looming over your head? If waiting &#39;til the last minute is keeping you from reaching your personal and professional goals... if you&#39;re still in the same place you were a year ago because of your bad habit... you need to take action now!" />
