  <title>Last Chance Cowboys: The Drifter - Anna Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From acclaimed author Anna Schmidt comes a sweeping historical Western romance about the unbreakable bonds of family, second chances, and a whole lot of heart in the Wild West.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I barely know you, and yet there&#39;s something about you that I trust. But why?&quot;&lt;br&gt; &quot;You know me, Maria. I&#39;m the guy trouble follows. Best if you keep your distance.&quot;&lt;br&gt; She ran the backs of her fingers along the line of his jaw. &quot;And what if I don&#39;t want to keep my distance?&quot; Her voice was barely a whisper.&lt;br&gt; &quot;Fair warning,&quot; he murmured, and pulled her close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught between a greedy corporation and a desperate love of the land, Maria Porterfield barely has time to mourn her father&#39;s death. If her family is to survive, it&#39;ll be up to her to take charge-but she can&#39;t do it alone. When a mysterious drifter rides into town, the handsome cowboy seems like an answer to her prayers. But Chet isn&#39;t interested in settling down, no matter how tempting the offer...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chet made his way West looking for a fresh start-the last thing he wants is to get involved in someone else&#39;s fight. But something about Maria awakens a powerful need to protect the fierce beauty at all costs. He never thought he&#39;d find love, but as danger presses in, he may find there&#39;s more beyond the next horizon than just another long and dusty trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A feisty heroine and a hero eager to make everything right.
