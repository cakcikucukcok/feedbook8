  <title>The Rising of Kalki - Jaimin Shukla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Rising of Kalki is a drama fiction. So many people have question regarding God. Who is God? How is God? Why God is invisible to us? How God look alike? What God does? In this novel, I have tried to give answer to these questions. But this novel is not a religious book. This is a drama fiction. I have taken variety of features of God. I have given the name of God Kalki. 
There is a big controversy over the God (Kalki). Sankarachaya has started dispute over God in India. So this book gives actual meaning of Kalki. In India, there are proclaimed Kalki and people are cheated with this type of disingenuous Saffron Cloth people. Few Saffron brigades are busy in cheating people of India. This book helps people to save themselves from Saffron disingenuous people.
One more controversy is of Yogi Adityanath, Member of Parliament of India, and his theory on Love Jihad and revenge. This book has main hero Waris, a Muslim guy and his wife is Khushboo, a Hindu Bhrahmin girl. So many people will think that, is Kalki Muslim, or Hindu or Christan? Why Kalki is doing inter religios marriage. So this book explains the meaning of Real Kalki. This book shows the correct definition of God. And because I am giving correct definition, the controversy will start. So many people will read this book to know what kalki is. 
&quot;Yadaa Yadaa Hi Dharmasya, Glanir Bhavati Bharat.
Abhyuthaanamdharmasya Tadaatmaanam Srujyaaham
Paritraanay Saadhunam Sinashaay cha Duskrutaam
Dharm Santhapanaajthaay Sambhavaami Yuge Yuge.&quot; (Gita, Adhyay [Chapter 4], Slok [reverse 7 and 8])
When humans have big problems, God will take birth on Earth to save the people of the Earth. In any era, when people will be in major problem, I will come on the earth to save people every time. Reverse Taken From Gita of Hindu. 
In this book I have mentioned that the entire citizens on the earth are God. All people have good side and bad side. We all have a God living in our heart but we couldn&#39;t recognize him. In 21st century, the name of God according to Hindu Mythology is Kalki and we all are Kalki. In Gita of Hindu, Bibal of Christian, Quran of Islam and in many more religious books, there is mentioned that God will get birth in 21st century. And according to Hindu mythology, the name of God will be &quot;Kalki&quot; 
In Gita of Hindu, there is written that Lord Vishnus ten incarnations named Kalki will get birth in twenty-first century when human being will be in problem. 
There is a story in all holy books, for example, in Bible there is written that when mankind will have major problem, Jesus Christ will take birth again on the earth. (The Bible, King James Version, Revelation 22:7).
In Holy Quran, there is written that when the sin and evil will be uncontrollable, Allah will come back to Earth. (Al Hajj 22.1)" />
