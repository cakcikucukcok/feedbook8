  <title>Your Symptoms Are Real: What to Do When Your Doctor Says Nothing Is Wrong - Benjamin H. Natelson, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for&lt;br&gt;Your Symptoms Are Real&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Thank God for this book. It provides the help that millions of Americans with &#39;silent illnesses&#39; like chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia have been waiting for. Dr. Natelson is a brilliant and compassionate clinician who covers the best treatments that medical science has to offer, along with a thorough consideration of complementary approaches. Short of cloning him, this book offers the specific help you need to work in partnership with your own physician.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of &lt;br&gt;Minding the Body, Mending the Mind&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Natelson is the kind of doctor every patient is looking for: smart, thoughtful, empathetic, and supportive. Reading Your Symptoms Are Real is the next best thing to having a world-renowned specialist managing your case.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--Charles W. Lapp, M.D., Director of the Hunter-Hopkins Center&lt;br&gt;and Assistant Consulting Professor at Duke University Medical Center&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do not throw up your hands and give up when one doctor after another tells you there is nothing wrong with you--instead, read this book! Benjamin Natelson is the person you have been looking for to guide you on your path to recovery.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Sandra Blakeslee, coauthor of The Body Has a Mind of Its Own&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Natelson superbly incorporates research studies, clinical trials (even on drugs in development), and patient case reports in this book. If you are battling pain and fatigue symptoms but your tests are all normal, you will enjoy reading Natelson&#39;s pro-patient approach to explaining the real nature of your illness, his recommended treatment approaches, and how to cope with everything that is going on in your life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Kristin Thorson, editor of the Fibromyalgia Network and President of the American Fibromyalgia Syndrome Association" />
