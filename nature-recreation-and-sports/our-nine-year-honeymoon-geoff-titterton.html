  <title>Our Nine Year Honeymoon - Geoff Titterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was 1987 when the idea of sailing away into the sunset became a lot more than just a dream. I had spent my whole career enjoying my work as a TV cameraman, lighting director, and technical coordinator with BBC. During that time, I raised a family and saw Lucy and Chris grow into two fine adults. Alas, my marriage failed after twenty-one years, which led me to start thinking of a new beginning. I had been messing about in boats since the age of ten, so sailing was my passion. I was not yet ready to retire, but the opening of the new marina in Penarth made it possible to live aboard and still continue working. 
Eclipse of Penarth became my home, with Barney, our beloved four-legged friend, for company. Quite soon I met Evey, and even though I made it very clear that I had serious thoughts of sailing away, she was not deterred from the idea of living on a boat. We married on June 18, 1993, and with my prospects of early retirement looking good, after thirty years of service, the stage was set for us to leave on our first wedding anniversary and begin our twenty-year honeymoon around the world." />
