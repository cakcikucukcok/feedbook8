  <title>Question of Trust (An Izzy McNeil Novel, Book 5) - Laura Caldwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But what if you can&#39;t tell which is which? When attorney Izzy McNeil’s home is broken into, right after her boyfriend moves in, she ignores the coincidence. When Theo is arrested on charges of fraud, she wants to believe he’s innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when a neighbor is found dead in their home, she can&#39;t ignore that something is very, very wrong. Izzy also can’t forget how Theo was inexplicably turned down for a mortgage. Or his recent moody silences. Or how a stranger warned her that Theo needs to “accept responsibility…”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thrust into Theo’s case, Izzy must walk the line between attorney and lover to prove hat Theo is innocent. But only Izzy can decide whether trusting Theo will keep her safe…or throw her into unimaginable danger.&lt;/p&gt;
