  <title>The Art of the Publisher - Roberto Calasso, Richard Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An interior look at Roberto Calasso&#39;s work as a publisher and his reflections on the art of book publishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this fascinating memoir, the author and publisher Roberto Calasso meditates on the art of book publishing. Recalling the beginnings of Adelphi in the 1960s, he touches on the Italian house&#39;s defining qualities, including the considerations involved in designing the successful &lt;i&gt;Biblioteca&lt;/i&gt; series and the strategy for publishing a wide range of authors of high literary quality, as well as the historic critical edition of the works of Nietzsche.&lt;br&gt;     With his signature erudition and polemical flair, Calasso transcends Adelphi to look at the publishing industry as a whole, from the essential importance of graphics, jackets, and cover flaps to the consequences of universal digitization. And he outlines what he describes as the &quot;most hazardous and ambitious&quot; profile of what a publishing house can be: a book comprising many books, a &lt;i&gt;form&lt;/i&gt; in which &quot;all the books published by a certain publisher could be seen as links in a single chain&quot;--a conception akin to that of other twentieth-century publishers, from Giulio Einaudi to Roger Straus, of whom the book offers brief portraits.&lt;br&gt;     An essential book for writers, readers, and editors, &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Publisher &lt;/i&gt;is a tribute to the elusive yet profoundly relevant art of making books.&lt;/p&gt;" />
