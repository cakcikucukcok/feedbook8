  <title>Cutting Ties - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roy Lee McCoy is desperate to leave the dying town of Deer Creek, Alabama and find his mother, who abandoned him when he was a teenager, leaving him with his alcoholic father. When he stops by his aunt&amp;#39;s hair salon on his way out of town, he finds that his sexy Aunt Eileen wants to leave town just as badly as he does, terrified of her abusive husband.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And Aunt Eileen will do anything to convince Roy Lee to take him with her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anything at all...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re here, Eileen,&amp;rdquo; Roy Lee admitted. &amp;ldquo;If you hadn&amp;#39;t come with me, I&amp;#39;d probably still be parked at that crossroads outside town, having a panic attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re welcome, baby.&amp;rdquo; She laid her hand on his cheek, and lifted her head, brushing his lips with hers. He reached with his arm, meaning to give her a quick hug, and was startled when his hand found the warm skin of her belly, in the gap where her t-shirt had pulled away from her jeans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pull away, his mind commanded him. Pull away now. But her skin was soft, and warm, and her lips were firm and sweet on his. Instead, he spread his fingers and gently rubbed his hand across the smooth flesh of her stomach, smiling as she moaned into his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eileen cradled Roy Lee&amp;#39;s cheek in her hand, taking pleasure in the slightly raspy feel of his stubble against her palm. Below, her stomach churned in lust as the heat of his hand sank through her skin, warming her belly and her feminine core.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, her clothes felt too tight, the loose fit of her t-shirt a restraint across her breasts, the worn denim of her jeans shackles that should be removed. Her hand moved from his cheek to the back of his neck, pulling his face closer to hers, and her lips opened, her tongue snaking out of her mouth to enter his. His hand moved from her belly to her hip, and she moved with him, rolling onto her side until her chest touched his, their bodies molded together from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So wrong, she thought to herself. This is so wrong. If Jilly could see us now she&amp;#39;d have a heart attack. Seducing this boy to get out of town, Eileen? What sort of god-fearing woman does that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it feels so right. As soon as I felt how gentle he was, back at the salon, I knew I had to have him. And I will. Tonight." />
