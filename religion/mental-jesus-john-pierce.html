  <title>“Mental Jesus” - John Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one on the planet can deny the Physical Signs of the Era in which we live.  We see them every day on television, the internet or in newspapers.  But, the Real Signs are &quot;unseen and are Spiritual in nature. In the King James Bible, Deception is not only mentioned four times in Matthew chapter twenty-four, but Jesus mentions it first among the signs of the end.  Certainly it must be among the most significant and perhaps the most powerful sign before His return.  We will discover this is great detail as we study the Bible together.
Satan, the enemy of all mankind tried to pollute the blood line of Messiah in order to stop any hope for redemption for mankind in Genesis Chapter 6, however, when that failed he tried to murder the descendants of the Messiah and eventually baby Jesus through King Herod.  He failed yet again!  Now the Dragon has his sights on the Gospel message itself.  The Devil knows that the Gospel is power and brings humanity out of the Darkness of this fallen world and into the Light of Jesus Christ.  Knowing his time is limited, Satan has started the final campaign to pervert and change the true Gospel into a false gospel called Mental Jesus!  
By the Grace of God, we will examine his methods, weapons and strategies using the Word of God to expose his plans.  Mental Jesus is an eye-opening realistic book that exposes the darkest Deception the enemy has ever attempted... to destroy the Gospel and replace the &quot;Good&quot; seed with an &quot;Evil&quot; seed.  This produces false coverts over and over again.  But, &quot;fear not&quot; the Lord says because 1 John 4:4 says &quot;You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&quot; Amen." />
