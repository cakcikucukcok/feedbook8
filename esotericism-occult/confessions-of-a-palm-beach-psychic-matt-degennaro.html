  <title>Confessions of a Palm Beach Psychic - Matt DeGennaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Confessions of a Palm Beach Psychic&lt;/I&gt; is a contemporary novel about a man, Micheal De Angelis, who is born with the gift of clairvoyance and who exists from his conscious birth onward in the passionate, strange, and wonderful world of the paranormal.  Living on the edge, beyond &#39;normal&#39; reality, he reads people&#39;s thoughts, encounters angels, spirits, and guides, and is abducted by aliens both good and bad.  Michael&#39;s life is fraught with danger, and he realizes early in his life that a dark force is trying its best to kill him . . . Only divine intervention (again and again) saves him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;During a journey across the country, Michael recalls in detail these supernatural events and waves that rocket him and all who come in contact with him into a state of grace.  Each step of the actual cross country journey represents the dawning of a new consciousness about what it means to be human and what it means to seek truth in a world of danger and deception, opening a brand new chapter in man&#39;s quest for immortality and embarking on a quest for peace, hope, and light into the unknown events within the fascinating context (through time and space) of a spiritual journey from the Palm Beaches across the United States to Seattle.&lt;/P&gt;" />
