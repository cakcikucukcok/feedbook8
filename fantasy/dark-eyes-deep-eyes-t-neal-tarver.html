  <title>Dark Eyes, Deep Eyes - T. Neal Tarver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two men. Two eternal destinies. One common hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College grad Nick doesnt trust God. Unimpressed by Gods work in his fathers life, Nick wages a daily war to thwart His holy advances. No verbal blasts. No waving God is dead! banners. Just a simple message written across his heart: God, youre not welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne, former pastor and current factory employee, drifts in doubts strong current. Hes Gods man, all right. He just hasnt felt like it in a while. A past failure holds his heart hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a beautiful Thursday in May, deaths specter burns both mens names into its appointment book. Each embarks on an amazing journeyone doused in dread, the other dripping with delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As heavens light shines, a troubled Wayne wants to hide in the dark. Will he overcome doubts drift to sail home in confidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick, lost in hells night, cant escape Gods searchlight. His memories force him to reevaluate his fathers weakness and the strength of his fathers God. For Nick, will regret become an itch he will have all eternity to scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Eyes, Deep Eyes&lt;/em&gt; examines life, death, faith, and hope against the backdrop of heaven, hell, and modern-day San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;" />
