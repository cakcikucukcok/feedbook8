  <title>Fulfilling Your God Given Destiny - Prince E A Jeshurun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book pictures reasons for the unfulfi lled life of Christians and ministers in
the body of Christ as some ministers lay hold on teaching in Old Testament laws
and man-made doctrines as a prerequisite for acceptance by God in grace. He
unravels through the revelation of the Spirit through the Word of God anecdotes
and illustrations on how the unbeliever, believer, and minister can fulfi ll their
God-given destiny.
It is a beautiful recipe for Bible school and teaching programs and an inspirational
guide for Bible students into understanding maturity in Christ.
Fulfi lling Your God Destiny is a companion that can help you realize the Kismet that was
ordained so as to have a meaning life. It simplifi es truths that can serve as fl ashlights to our feet
as we journey through life.
Evangelist A.J. Shenuda
Anglican preacher, novelist and teacher.
Prince has expounded truth in Gods word, through in dept insight in the word by revelation
knowledge. Fulfi lling Your God Given Destiny, is the Word from God for our time, to position
the church for greatness in the Kingdom of God.
