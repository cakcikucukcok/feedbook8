  <title>A World of Power, Lies, &amp; Deception - Ruth Coombs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world of Power, Lies and Deception I find myself breathing a sigh of relief. To be told as a child we can trust our Leaders in Churches, Schools, Government, Community Groups and the list goes on, finally, everyone now has the pleasure of reaping exactly what they sowed. Children of my generation were all survivors of crimes that have become unspeakable. The Adults sadly enough were very sick individuals who took their Dysfunctional minds and expected our generation to put up with it. There is no excuse for the immoral acts in this country and thank God our children are fed up with all of it.  Thank You to all young people who are out there making a future for my children and grandchildren. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR BAD BEHAVIOUR!
For all Survivors like myself you have reinforced to us older people that yes we were telling the truth when we asked for help and now we can finally live in Peace.
Never be Scared to tell, it does not matter what position in life they hold. Now the world through so much destruction is on the healing end. Life was given to us to enjoy and now the Criminals are slowly being caught, we can all finally live in PEACE." />
