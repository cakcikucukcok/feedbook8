  <title>A Lay Preacher but God&#39;s Work? - A. Sinner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In A Sinners second book he again states he has to keep to  his pen name and again changes all names of churches, friends and  family because of, as he puts it,  historical freedoms long ago fought and died for in my country, but now lost to dangerous forces, that are not only unchallenged but appeased and encouraged.
He gives a chapter on his own English roots and background  where he says his Saviour showed him the first signs of sin of which he needed to take to His cross. 
He mentions first hand experience of Jesuit and Christian Brother school teachers, who not surprisingly, he is no fan of. Yet  his criticisms again are not left to Roman Catholicism alone. 
As in his first book, often humorous, often tragic words, but now not just in sermon notes but observations, experiences, speaking notes, modern parables, one or two poems and also in his own mostly pen and ink illustrations. 
He gives a little more detail than in his first book of his  working for his Saviour in missionary organisations such as Prison Fellowship, SASRA and local church work.
Through it all, he leaves the same message for all:  look to the Bible for  inspiration but especially to unbelievers for salvation only in the Bibles Author ,The Holy Spirit and the Word of God Jesus Christ! John
Then they asked Him, What must we do to do the works God requires? Jesus answered The work of God is this: to believe in the one He has sent! John 6;28&amp;29." />
