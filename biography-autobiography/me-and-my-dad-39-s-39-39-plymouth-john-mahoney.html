  <title>Me and My Dad&#39;s &#39;39 Plymouth - John Mahoney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I enjoy many things in life. A good steak, a chocolate doughnut, chocolate candy, chocolate cake, well, just about anything chocolate. I also enjoy a good movie, especially the kind that make me laugh. I enjoy laughing, and making other people laugh. I enjoy nostalgia. I have many happy memories of growing up, and I enjoy looking and thinking about the toys I had, the TV shows I watched, the clothes I wore, and the cars I knew.  What I enjoy the most is cars. If you were to ask me why I like cars so much, I would have to answer, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; What I do know is, I don&#39;t get the same feeling of excitement when I see a locomotive, or a biplane, or a wooden boat. I appreciate those things, but it&#39;s cars, especially antique cars, that I really enjoy. I am intrigued by automotive history, and it is those types of books that fill my library.  My book, and most of my writing for that matter, is about cars, humor, and nostalgia. I have a pretty good memory, especially where money is concerned. I never had a lot of money, so I learned to spend it wisely, getting the most for my dollar. I&#39;m not good at math, but I did know I could get a 16-ounce Royal Crown Cola and Drakes Coffee Cake for 25 cents.  Anyway, I hope my stories release some memories of your youth." />
