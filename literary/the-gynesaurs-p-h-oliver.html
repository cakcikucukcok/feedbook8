  <title>The Gynesaurs - P.H. Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anthea Brock, gynecologist extraordinaire, was perfectly content to be a single woman past her reproductive prime&amp;mdash;or Gynesaur, as she and her coworkers termed it. Her decision to remain childless, after all, was why she&amp;rsquo;d divorced her ex-husband, Ian, and left Britain to start a new practice in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually one to lead with her head and not her heart, Anthea is surprised when a return trip to Wales results in a heated romp with Ian. Even more unexpected is the pregnancy that results from it. Conflicted, Anthea turns to her fellow Gynesaurs for guidance. But they&amp;rsquo;ve got troubles of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolina Stiletto, daughter of a murdered mafia member, is unraveling her family legacy. Molly McGilvery&amp;mdash;widow, mother, and sister to a special needs brother&amp;mdash;is ready for romance. Glynda Wicksteed, left penniless by her gay ex-husband, struggles to pursue her dreams after a devastating diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid personal strife, the Gynesaurs must also juggle a roster of eccentric patients and plan the upcoming (boring but important) hospital fundraiser. Trusting in the unbreakable bonds of love and friendship, will these four extraordinary women find the courage to evolve or risk becoming extinct?&lt;/p&gt;" />
