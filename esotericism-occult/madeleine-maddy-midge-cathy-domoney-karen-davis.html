  <title>Madeleine, Maddy &amp; Midge - Cathy Domoney, Karen Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Madeleline has two secret friends, Maddy and Midge. Maddys happy messages makes Madeleine feel tall, strong and full of confidence. Midge however, fills Madeleine with worries, troubles and doubt and makes her feel small, scared and alone. Madeleine has found the magic spell so that Maddys voice will be all she will hear and Midge will disappear like the Pop of a bubble. Madeleine has a power to decide whether to be happy or sad. The question is, what will she decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book offers children a clear and accessible story through which greater confidence and self-esteem can develop, and the suggestions and activities offered at the end of the story will be welcomed and used by many adults who support children in a broad range of settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Hebe, art psychotherapist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All children deserve to feel good about themselves, and this book helps them feel just that. The story appeals to children of all ages and will become a much-thumbed favourite. Parents and teachers will find it a useful aid for raising self-esteem through assemblies, circle times and bedtimes. What a way to boost their confidence!&lt;/p&gt;
