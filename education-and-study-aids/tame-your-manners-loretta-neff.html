  <title>Tame Your Manners - Loretta Neff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tame Your Manners at K.A.M.P. Safari is a fun, meaningful and most importantly, memorable way for a child to learn manners. Any adult or child who reads this book will delight in the clever illustrations and correlations of animal characteristics to the manners advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phrases like Lions Dont Need to Roar, Dont Be a Whino Rhino, and Stand Tall like a Giraffe will be forever fixed in a readers mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For caregivers and parents with demanding schedules, finding time to teach or mentor children is increasingly difficult. While teaching professionals are relied upon to teach academic skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic, the importance of social skills is often overlooked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learning social skills early, especially during childhood, can shape a childs character and greatly impact his or her life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Offered by The Elegant Way Foundation, EWFs vision is to teach, inspire, and motivate children.&lt;br /&gt;
The EWF motto:Doing Well by Doing Good Deeds&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What a painless way for children to learn proper behavior, helpfulness, courtesy, and character! Wouldnt be surprised if their parents didnt pick up a few tips along the way.&lt;br /&gt;
- Dianna Booher, author of Communicate With Confidence and Creating Personal Presence&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every young person I know will be getting Tame Your Manners for their next birthday. In fact, Im getting one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;
- D.A. Benton, author of The CEO Difference and Lions Dont Need to Roar&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tame Your Manners is VERY clever, cute, and easy to visualize which will help kids remember these valuable lifetime skills. My son and I think this book is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;
