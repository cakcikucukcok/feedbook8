  <title>The Story of Ian - Hyden Standards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;14 year old Ian is found swimming in shark filled waters after having survived the Cuban gunboat attack and massacre of the 13-de-Marzo tug. He is rescued by a U.S. naval vessel and brought back to the U.S. It is while living in Miami that Ian grows up to become another of America&#39;s great success stories. His tenacity, determination, and math skills earn him a place among America&#39;s youngest ever self-made millionaries. But disaster strikes Ian in more ways then one, turning his rags to riches story back again into a riches to rags downfall. First, there&#39;s the financial meltdown in 2008 that robs him of most of his wealth. A $20 million fine leaves him near penniless. Then a freak accident leaves him for dead if not for the heroic efforts of paramedics. Ian next awakens from a 40 day coma whereupon he spends the next 2 years in rehab relearning his motor skills. He thinks he&#39;s cheated the Grim Reaper yet again. This convinces him that he&#39;s meant for a special purpose in life, or at least that&#39;s what his new visions and voices tell him. Ian&#39;s life journey takes a startliing twist once he is back on his own. He begins filling journals upon journals with events only he can interpret. But it&#39;s when he starts his new revolutionary website, and then begins video taping some of his intentions, that Ian comes to the immediate attention of Homeland Security. What he suggests on his site for the coming New Year shoots him straight to the top of Homeland&#39;s watch-list. Once a sterling example of an &#39;against all odds&#39; success story, Ian is now forced to hide from authorities who consider him having goine rogue, though his site continues to grow as a voice of the people. Fast paced and informative, this is the story of Ian.&lt;/P&gt;" />
