  <title>Static Ruin - Corey J. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corey J. White concludes his pulse-pounding space opera in &lt;i&gt;Static Ruin&lt;/i&gt;. As the most wanted voidwitch in the galaxy has no place left to run--except back to those who created her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;She killed the man who trained her. She killed the fleet that came for her. She killed the planet that caged her. Now she must confront her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mars Xi is on the run, a bounty on her head and a kill count on her conscience. All she has left are her mutant cat Ocho and her fellow human weapon Pale, a young boy wracked by seizures who can kill with a thought. She needs him treated, and she needs to escape, and the only thread left to pull is her frayed connection to her father, Marius Teo. That thread will take her to the outskirts of the galaxy, to grapple with witch-cults and privately-owned planets, and into the hands of the man who engineered her birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Voidwitch Saga&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;Killing Gravity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2 &lt;i&gt;Void Black Shadow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3 &lt;i&gt;Static Ruin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
