  <title>The New Countess - Fay Weldon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;England, 1905. Lord Robert and Lady Isobel Dilberne, as well as their entire regal estate, with its hundred rooms, are busy planning for a lavish visit from King Edward VII and his mistress just a few months away. Preparations are elaborate and exhaustive: the menus and fashions must be just so. But even amidst the excitement, not everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Rosina--now widowed and wealthy-- insists on publishing a scandalous book despite her mother&#39;s objections. Arthur Dilberne and Chicago Heiress Minnie O&#39;Brien&#39;s two young sons--the eldest of whom is heir to the estate--are being reared to Lady Isobel&#39;s tastes, not Minnie&#39;s. After making a shocking discovery, Minnie will take drastic measures for the sake of her children. And when fate deals a hand in the middle of the royal shooting party, the entire Dilberne estate will face upheaval once again.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Countess&lt;/i&gt; is the final novel in Fay Weldon&#39;s outstanding trilogy that began with &lt;i&gt;Habits of the House&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Long Live the King&lt;/i&gt;. As the bestselling novelist and award-winning writer for the pilot episode of the original &lt;i&gt;Upstairs Downstairs&lt;/i&gt;, Weldon magnificently lifts the curtain on early twentieth-century British society, upstairs and downstairs, under one stately roof.&lt;/p&gt;" />
