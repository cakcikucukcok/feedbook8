      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this spine-tingling story from Newbery Medal winner Avi, a boy must solve the mystery of the ghost haunting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of Tony Gilbert&amp;#8217;s life, he has thought of his uncle as &amp;#8220;Weird Uncle Charlie.&amp;#8221; That is, until Uncle Charlie moves in with Tony and his family. Uncle Charlie is still odd, of course&amp;#8212;talking about spirits and other supernatural stuff&amp;#8212;but he and Tony become fast friends, and Tony ends up having a lot of fun with Uncle Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Uncle Charlie dies suddenly, Tony is devastated. Then he starts seeing Uncle Charlie &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;! It doesn&amp;#8217;t help that Tony switched schools&amp;#8212;it was Uncle Charlie&amp;#8217;s dying wish that Tony attend the Penda School, where Uncle Charlie himself went as a kid. The Penda School is eerie enough without his uncle&amp;#8217;s ghost making it worse. On top of that, rumors have been circulating about a student who went missing shortly before Tony arrived.
