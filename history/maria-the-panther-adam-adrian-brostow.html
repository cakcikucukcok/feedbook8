  <title>Maria the Panther - Adam Adrian Brostow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maria the Panther presents the story of the authors grandmother, Maria, who
was a strong professional woman well ahead of her times. At the same time, her
biography provides a sweeping overview of the history of twentieth-century Europe,
transcending cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandma Maria was born in 1902 in Warsaw, which at that time was part of the
Russian Empire. She died in 1992 at the age of eighty-nine, in a free Poland. She
survived World War I and cheated death at least four times during World War II.
She was arrested by the Soviet NKVD (later known as the KGB). As private in the
Home Army (serial number 202), she fought the Nazis in the Resistance and the
Warsaw Uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was taken to a Nazi concentration camp and later worked at a labor camp in
Berlin. There she gained a nicknameThe Pantherfor her resourcefulness
and courage. She survived the carpet bombing of Berlin. In the late 1940s, at
a time when most women were confined to domestic duties, she became the
president of a bank. Years later she joined the free Solidarity trade union. She
lived to see the fall of the Berlin Wall and to participate in free elections in her
native Poland.&lt;/p&gt;" />
