  <title>White Widow - David A. Waples</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A president dies of natural causes. A vice-presidential vacancy. A congressman brutally murdered.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;America&#39;s widowed first lady turns to press secretary Nathaniel Freeman-a dashing former college football star-to challenge the Speaker of the House, an ambitious rival who has become an &quot;accidental&quot; president. The upstart Freeman copes with a critically ill wife, a powerful opposing political machine, his personal doubts, and an assassin&#39;s attempt on his life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, Sandra Sweet, a former female bicycle cop turned rookie detective, and Caroline McRue, an ex-prostitute now tabloid news reporter, form an uneasy partnership to investigate the murder of a powerful congressman. The two suspect a connection between the lawmaker&#39;s slaying and the &quot;natural&quot; death of the President. The brash, but inexperienced investigators combine their talents and develop a personal relationship previously unfulfilled in their lives. The intrigue reaches a climax as the latent lust for power and influence places Freeman, Sweet, and McRue in a position to choose between victory or integrity, at the cost of their lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;White Widow&lt;/I&gt; is a nonstop political suspense thriller that questions who the real enemy of the nation is.&lt;/P&gt;" />
