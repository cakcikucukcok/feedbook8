  <title>Taint - S. L. Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This no-holds barred, sexy &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller pushes the envelope like no other novel has as it spins the titillating, enticing tale of one man who teaches women &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; they need to know to make their partners happy in the bedroom&amp;#8230;while making their own wildest fantasies come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, you&amp;#39;re probably asking yourself two things: &lt;em&gt;Who am I?&lt;/em&gt; And, &lt;em&gt;what the hell are you doing here?&lt;/em&gt; Let&amp;#39;s start with the most obvious question, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re here, ladies, because you can&amp;#39;t f*ck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, stop it. Don&amp;#39;t cringe. No one under the age of 80 clutches their pearls. You might as well get used to it, because for the next six weeks, you&amp;#39;re going to hear that word a lot. And you&amp;#39;re going to say it a lot. Go ahead, try it out on your tongue. F*ck. &lt;em&gt;F***ck.&lt;/em&gt; Ok, good. Now where were we? If you enrolled yourself in this program then you are wholly aware that you&amp;#39;re a lousy lay. Good for you. Admitting it is half the battle. For those of you that have been sent here by your husband or significant other, dry your tears and get over it. You&amp;#39;ve been given a gift, ladies. The gift of mind-blowing, wall-climbing, multiple-orgasm-inducing sex. You have the opportunity to f*ck like a porn star. And I guarantee, you will when I&amp;#39;m done with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who am I? Well, for the next six weeks, I will be your lover, your teacher, your best friend, and your worst enemy. Your every-f*cking-thing. I&amp;#39;m the one who is going to save your relationship and your sex life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am Justice Drake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I turn housewives into whores. Now...who&amp;#39;s first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
