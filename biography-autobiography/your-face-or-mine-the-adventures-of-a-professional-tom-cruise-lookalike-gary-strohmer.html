  <title>Your Face or Mine - The Adventures of a Professional Tom Cruise Lookalike - Gary Strohmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever wondered what it must be like to look like someone really famous? What if it were a Hollywood actor known the world over! Imagine the fun you could have, the tricks you could play and the problems it could cause all because of a twist of fate. These are the memoirs of an ordinary guy, Gary, with an extraordinary job who went from constantly being told he looked like Tom Cruise to ending up, almost by accident, becoming the top UK professional Tom Cruise lookalike for nearly 10 years. This is a very amusing but also frank inside view of the world of the lookalike. From the early days of &quot;just having a laugh&quot; with it and getting up to mischief with your mates to being taken on by the lookalike agencies, pretending to be Tom and earning a living out of it. Finding out about the cut-throat business side of things and the doors it opened, to seeing yourself on the T.V and billboards etc. to meeting many a famous person, as well as other weird and wonderful characters along the way. Onto the scary side of things, which involved being chased by the Paparazzi as well as being mobbed by crowds who have mistaken you for the real thing. Even ending up with your own &quot;pet&quot; stalker. So buckle up and take a ride on this funny and true-life adventure." />
