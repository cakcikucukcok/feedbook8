  <title>The Vytautas Pursuit - J.B.E. Bryan McNally</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Their trust in each other was unerring. Born out of matehood, love and crisis, they would always be there for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jack Carpenter questioned his reason for being, after four consecutive tours in Afghanistan, little did he realise that his soul searching would lead to an earth-shattering change in the course of Lithuanian history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for a dizzying pursuit through Roman times, medieval eastern Europe, to present day Lithuania as Jack strives to recover crown jewels lost for over half a millennium. The forces behind his chase and the evil that seeks to prevent it are complex and life changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack&amp;rsquo;s estranged mother, his hitherto unknown half-sister and his new love&amp;rsquo;s brother and sister, all held to ransom by the Lithuanian Mafia in exchange for the coronation regalia. The tangled web of deceit holding many twists and turns throughout the pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Jack, his best mate Danny and his new love, the mysterious Lithuanian born Agnetha, can unravel the mystery of the jewels and free their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first in the Adventures of Jack Carpenter series proves to be a heart-thumping, adrenaline-fuelled chase throughout.&lt;/p&gt;" />
