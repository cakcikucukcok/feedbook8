  <title>Kissed by My Confidant - Lion Joseph P. Griggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rosemary was my confidant, my teacher, my true love. I was her last student, her caretaker, her strength. This book was written to help me remember my past upon coming out of a coma four years ago and dealing with the debilitating West Nile virus I had contracted after Rosemary had gone. Once you finish reading about our journey through life and experiencing happiness as well as hardships, I hope that you value what I have come to understand. With the help of family and friends, you can overcome anything. Rosemary had dreams. Some of those beautiful dreams she strived to make a reality on her own. Her other dreams she enlisted the help of others to make come true.
My friends in the Lions Club urged me to write a book about my life. At first I would record my thoughts, and my friend would try to put them to paper; however, my thoughts would wander and were often incoherent. Through sharing my experiences and looking over photo albums, my mind and memory returned, resulting in this book about my life, my Rosemary, my confidant that I now share with you." />
