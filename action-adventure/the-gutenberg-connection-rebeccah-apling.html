  <title>The Gutenberg Connection - Rebeccah Apling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gutenberg Connection sends young and pregnant Hannah Morraine down a dangerous path to reclaim her inheritance from the man who steals it. Preoccupied by her brothers disappearance into World War IIs European upheaval, Hannah must balance giving birth to her fourth child, taking care of her immediate and extended family, and finding a way to sell the original Gutenberg Bible that belongs jointly to her, her parents, and her siblings. 
The sale of the Gutenberg Bible is taken out of Hannahs trust and given to the thief who betrays the entire family. As consolation, Hannahs mother gives her a package of original medieval poetry, penned by the hand of Gutenberg. The family and Hannah are unaware of its value, which is much more than that of the Gutenberg Bible. Hannahs friend, a native German discovers its value. The Bible thief begins his plan to steal them, too. 
Bethany, Hannahs fourth child, arrives, and Hannah encounters Gutenberg and Christ in an out-of-body-experience. Bethany describes Hannah rescuing her children from a disgusting pigpen expedition, taking a trip to Washington to find people to help locate her brother, and her entrapment into an intended fiery grave designed for her by the Gutenberg Bible bandit. 
Why has God set her into such a place of mayhem? Will she survive this season of trouble and testing? Share her faith and determination as she takes on the adventure of a lifetimediscovering the Gutenberg connection." />
