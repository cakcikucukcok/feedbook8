  <title>MILESTONE: Project Amber - Carl Lakeland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angel Nadine Cross. Australian journalist. Not afraid to take a risk to get the story out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It begins with the text message from an unknown sender. A text referring to the name Angelique. A name she has not used since age ten. Angel realises a voice from her past has reached out. Her violent childhood has returned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Angel&amp;rsquo;s source, former SAS operator Nathan Masters, tracks the text to a location near Alice Springs. The phone is hacked and sensitive data uploaded. To find the answers, Angel and Nathan journey to Alice Springs. But there&amp;rsquo;s something else. Nathan is holding onto secrets. And now he must bring Angel into the loop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a bizarre meeting, Nathan comes clean. Angel learns about MILESTONE. A covert operation to bring about the annihilation of Earth, he says. She starts her recorder. It&amp;rsquo;s a story she wants to break wide open. Then, she discovers a one-terratonne thermonuclear device is in the hands of an enemy rogue state. They aim to use it, and then they will escape to a new world, so he tells her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arriving in Alice Springs, Angel and Nathan are ambushed and barely escape. She now has to leave her life as a journalist behind. She is inducted into the ASIS cell, Charlotte Station, where the events of PROJECT AMBER begin to emerge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With her team of secret service professionals, Angel sets out to become part of the operation to save Earth from extinction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stakes are massive, the risks stratospheric, and Angel counts the costs as one by one, she begins to lose those close to her. But she must carry on with the mission to terminate the MILESTONE linchpin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located somewhere at the joint defence facility, Pine Gap, the Gene-Ark program known as PROJECT AMBER must be destroyed before the PEACEMAKER missile is launched.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
