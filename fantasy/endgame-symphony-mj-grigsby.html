  <title>Endgame Symphony - Mj Grigsby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At one time, he enjoyed lifethen tragedy forced self-medication and recrimination on him. 
When deep distress forces Devlin Goode beyond his ability to endure, he makes a desperate choice that initiates a chain of experiences. That choice was made with a curse for Heaven and Hell dripping from his lips. Then, when a profound memory sobers his mind, he is forced to reconsider his intentions. Losing consciousness, Devlin wakes up in, he believes, a correctional mental facility.  He finds himself surrounded by dubious characters including presumed mental patients, staff, and two very mysterious and puzzling men named Sheperd and Forge. Those two appear to Devlin at odd times and with odd ramblings seemingly in an attempt to maneuver him to their own ends; ends that are a mystery to him. Although Devlin truly has no idea of what hes become involved with or where hes being led, he knows the stakes are monumental! 
One inexplicable event after the next forces Devlin to question his own judgment, his senses, and eventually his very sanity! Could the things he is witnessing possibly be real? Consumed with his own suffering, Devlin remains unsure of what is real and who to trust, including himself. Each encounter he has with those around him chips away at his fragile resolve. After being racked in mind, body, and spirit, Devlin Goode is in time brought to an epiphany, possibly proving to be the ultimate answer to his very existence." />
