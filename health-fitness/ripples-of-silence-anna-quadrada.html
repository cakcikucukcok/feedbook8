  <title>Ripples of Silence - Anna Quadrada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in a world dominated by fear. As conscious, responsible citizens, we dutifully switch on our TVs every evening to follow the news and get to know what happened. However, no matter what, the summary of the day is always a grim list of disasters that restlessly shape our inner understanding of the world. Consequently, the future of humankind seems bleak, and the meaning of our stressed lives pointless. But what if, in the middle of this media-driven society, one of the most famous and acclaimed news presenters decides to stop talking? Would you understand his decision, or would you be outraged by it? Would you want to know why he stopped talking, or would you rather think hes crazy?
Ripples of Silence is a fast-paced psychological thriller that will take the reader through a hypothetical scenario where the silence of a prominent news presenter boldly questions our societys most hidden assumptions and beliefs." />
