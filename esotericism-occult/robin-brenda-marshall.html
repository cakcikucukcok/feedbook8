  <title>Robin - Brenda Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Hode, son of a forester in Earl Warrens park, lives a comfortable life in Wakefield in the north of England where his mother is active in the Craft, a religion focusing on healing, friendships and exotic ceremonies.
	But, at the age of seven, Roberts pleasant life changes when he is humiliated after a beating by his cruel schoolmaster.  Afraid to return to school, he plays truant, exploring the town and forests and learning about the miserable and sometimes fascinating lives of his neighbors.
	As a teenager working with his father in the forest, Robert becomes known for his philandering ways but his behavior changes when, on a visit to wealthy relatives, he meets Matilda.  Determined to marry this powerful, beautiful woman, Robert builds a fine house in the center of Wakefield.  Matilda accepts his proposal but their happy lives are disrupted when the Earl of Lancaster seizes all of Warrens lands and Robert is summoned to fight for the Earl of Lancaster against the army of King Edward II.
	Robert flees the disastrous battle and searches Barnsdale forest for a mysterious hermit he once met as a child.  Matilda and others from nearby conquered towns join him in the forest.  A skilled archer, Robert becomes the leader of a notorious band of outlaws, calling himself Robin Hood and his bride, Maid Marion.  With Marions extensive knowledge of the Craft, they conduct erotic celebrations where Robin serves as High Priest and Marion as High Priestess.
	Intrigued by the legends of the infamous outlaw who robs the rich and helps the poor, the weak and effeminate King Edward pays a surprise visit to the forest and invites Robin and Marion to serve him in the Tower of London.  But life in London is not what they expected." />
