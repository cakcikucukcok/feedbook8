  <title>Switch: Time for a Change - Sandra LaMorgese PhD, Jessica Bowen, Kelly Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sandra is living proof that you can do anything you want, at any age, and that you can follow your passion no matter what it is. Sandra&amp;rsquo;s journey through life will challenge all your assumptions about middle-aged or &amp;lsquo;older&amp;rsquo; women. Her sexual evolution will make you want to embark on your OWN sexual evolution.

Will it push you out of your comfort zone? Most certainly. Are parts of it shocking and risqu&amp;eacute;? Of course! But will it also take you on an eloquent and meaningful journey of self-discovery, honesty, and love? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In her memoir, Dr. Sandra LaMorgese (and her dominatrix alter-ego) take readers on a wild ride through a story that begins with struggle and defeat, but ultimately transforms into a tale of fulfillment, success, and happiness&amp;mdash;all because of a year spent working in one of the most famous BDSM dungeons in New York City at 55 years old after losing everything&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her on-the-job stories will make your jaw drop, and her stream-of-consciousness descriptions of her first days down in the dungeon will have you laughing out loud. Most importantly, though, in Switch, you will meet a person who faced challenges just like yours&amp;mdash;dreams that looked unattainable, a love life that felt unfulfilling, and a future that seemed full of uncertainty. You will listen in on every epiphany during the difficult times of transition, and you will witness the beautiful metamorphosis that brought her to a place of true success, love, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Through Sandra&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability, bravery, and unfailing sense of humor, you just might find the same courage that she did&amp;mdash;the courage to live authentically and to finally create the life of your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
