  <title>The Valley of Cross Purposes - Carol J. Frost PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the late 1800s, Charles Nordhoff forged the shape of modern journalism and profoundly influenced both politicians andpolitics. Principled, activist, investigative, and a champion of the disenfranchised and poor, he was more interested incharacter and results than in personality and credit. And like the blacksmith wielding his hammer, he left us the tangibleproducts of his labors, but few details of himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With superb research, illuminating insights, and eloquent prose, Carol Frost brings Nordhoff vividly to life: both the man andhis extraordinary impacts on politics, journalism, government, and public discourseimpacts that are still defining publiclife today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Journalists, historians, and activists will find context and inspiration in this captivating and previously untold story, a storythat in many important ways feels like it was written about the events and debates of our own time rather than those ofmore than 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;" />
