  <title>Dreams and In-Between - Betty Storie Strawther</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;                  
I think you will find this is not just another dream book since it includes some unique ideas as well as older views regarding the why and what of a dream. Over the years I have read many books offering a variety of ideas and theories on the subject, plus I took a thought provoking dream study course through the Edgar Cayce foundation. I will show you a simple way to outline and analyze your dream and help others if the need arises. It is not only fun to do, but it can often be very beneficial. I have included thirty-four of my personal dreams with their interpretations as examples. They cover a variety of subjects from spiritual to spooky and all the in-between.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you know, dreams can be a puzzle to solve especially when they contain a strange assortment of things and people. However, when you learn how to connect the dots it will help you solve the puzzle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look inside for an easier way to analyze your sleeping thoughts plus a brief section on possible symbolic meanings. Happy dreaming!
