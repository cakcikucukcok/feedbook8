  <title>Pilgrimage for Ecstasy - Bryan Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was content with hanging out with my friends, no matter what their dysfunctions and clinically destructive habits. I liked to mind my own business in patient realms, but my brother and our friends liked to drag me into problems I could not solve. My friends, they were cheap entertainment to me, no matter what kind of ridiculous scenes they got me into. 
But then, every so often as I dared, I would step out onto a limb of my life just to see how fragile it might be. I didn&#39;t have a girlfriend at the time, so how I met that woman, it was purely an accident. Really, it was and I mean it sincerely. She was pretty and I was in the right place at the right time. It seemed like things were going smoothly, for an encounter that blossomed from a blind date that had gone off track. Yes, it did look good from a distance to someone that didn&#39;t know better, even to me. But then, I met her sister. She caused all the trouble. Really, she was and I mean it sincerely." />
