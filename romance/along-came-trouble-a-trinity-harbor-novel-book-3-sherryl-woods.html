  <title>Along Came Trouble (A Trinity Harbor Novel, Book 3) - Sherryl Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Sheriff Tucker Spencer has seen some action…but finding an almost-naked woman asleep in his bed leaves him speechless. Especially because this same woman, Mary Elizabeth, broke Tucker&#39;s heart six years ago by marrying a charismatic Virginia politician, a man who&#39;s just been found shot dead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mary Elizabeth needs Tucker&#39;s help. Needs &lt;em&gt;him,&lt;/em&gt; period. But along with her return comes all the town gossip about their reunion romance. Even his father, who can&#39;t manage his own love life, is determined to &quot;impart his wisdom&quot; regarding theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tucker&#39;s not listening to any of it. He just needs to clear Mary Elizabeth&#39;s name. But in the end, he&#39;ll confront a mystery even more confusing than murder: how the heart makes room for forgiveness and a new start.&lt;/p&gt;
