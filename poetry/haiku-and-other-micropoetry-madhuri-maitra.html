  <title>Haiku and Other Micropoetry - Madhuri Maitra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A short poem is a drop of the divine, a brief, brilliant flash. An emotion surges, you create an image, and the jewel is born, plucked out of thought-flow, rubbed and polished to its innate glow. 
Haiku is like that. Intrinsically beautiful! Some see the beauty and others do not. Moreover, poetry is a personal experience. Theres no saying what will touch the heart, the senses, the brain, and why. 
Haiku and Other Micropoetry would appeal to many people who have had idyllic childhoods in a world less crowded; who have enjoyed simple pleasures, or not; who have loved, lost, laughed, cried, danced, achieved, failed, and done everything that life bid them. They have searched for meaning and known the pain of that search. They have allowed themselves to grow with every experience. 
Haiku heals. A short verse brings moments of recognition. A lot more can happen within these pages. Haiku and Other Micropoetry will be read by some with love and some with dj vu. Some will identify with it, some might just toss it aside, and others might carry it around as a favorite dip-into read." />
