  <title>The Book of Summer - James F. David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a gift from God, Ira Breitling has taken his followers off of Earth and colonized space. But Breitling&#39;s followers are slowly discovering their differences. So Ira takes his core followers beyond Planet America, but one follower, Mother Jones, has decided to stay behind and colonize America. A vast number of captives from the battle on Earth have been enslaved by Jones on America, and it only took a generation for racism and cruelty to set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer Lund is a teenaged slave-girl on Master Rice&#39;s farm. Her mother, bearing Rice&#39;s child, fears that Summer will soon catch the eye of the slaveowner. After a vicious encounter with Master Rice&#39;s oldest son Washington, Summer flees the farm and learns of her people&#39;s past. Her journey will bring a new era to light, and change the course of Planet America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, after being duped by Fellowship members, Rey Mann has been marooned in a far-off frozen corner of Planet America. He must survive with no technology and only his own wits to protect him, living off the land for food and boiling ice and snow for water. His survival is fueled by a vow of vengeance toward the men who tricked him, but what he learns along his journey will bring him face to face with the God he now so vehemently denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a new force of darkness is on its way to America, hell-bent on destroying the entire planet. Continuing the exodus he began in &lt;i&gt;Judgment Day&lt;/i&gt;, James F. David brings us new, exciting tales of faith and redemption and the benefits of adhering to the teachings of Christianity, even as Earth is destroyed and we begin to inhabit the far-reaching universe.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
