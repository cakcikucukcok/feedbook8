  <title>The Third Best Hull - Dennis Hull, Robert Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone knows about Bobby Hull, but not everyone remembers that his brother Dennis also was a hockey star in his own right and in this book, the other Hull outlines his life in hockey with humorous anecdotes and stories. Hockey legend Gordie Howe once said there were two superstars in the Hull family: Bobby, the Golden Jet, one of the greatest players ever to tie up a pair of skates for the Chicago Blackhawks, and his brother Dennis, who had a solid career with the Chicago Blackhawks as well. Dennis is now a sought-after public speaker in North America as fans were equally interested to know about the other Hull. Some of the stories include the time Hull taught Guy Lafleur to speak English; how Hull once won a coin toss worth $250,000; and talks of his ongoing rivalry with Henri Richard, the younger brother of the legendary Montreal Canadiens&#39; great Maurice Richard. Along the way, Dennis gives an account of the famed 1972 Russia vs Canada series and speaks with candor about his brother, Bobby; his nephew and St. Louis Blues&#39; star Brett Hull; and hockey legends such as Howe, Ken Dryden, and Bobby Orr. This new edition includes new photos and fills in the blank on the past 25 years, bringing the Hull family story up-to-date,and providing insight into the life of a hockey star without taking himself too seriously." />
