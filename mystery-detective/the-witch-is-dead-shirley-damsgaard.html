So when Ophelia&#39;s elderly Aunt Dot, eager for adventure, wants to investigate the murder of a funeral director in the neighboring town, Ophelia tries to say no.

Ophelia and Abby will have to battle a creepy crematorium owner and an invasion from some modern-day body snatchers to find their prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233; . . . or else they&#39;ll have to hold a s&amp;#233;ance just to speak to her again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
