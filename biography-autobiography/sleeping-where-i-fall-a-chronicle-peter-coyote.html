  <title>Sleeping Where I Fall: A Chronicle - Peter Coyote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In his energetic, funny, and intelligent memoir, Peter Coyote relives his fifteen-year ride through the heart of the counterculture&amp;#151;a journey that took him from the quiet rooms of privilege as the son of an East Coast stockbroker to the riotous life of political street theater and the self-imposed poverty of the West Coast communal movement known as The Diggers. With this innovative collective of artist-anarchists who had assumed as their task nothing less than the re-creation of the nation&amp;#8217;s political and social soul, Coyote and his companions soon became power players.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In prose both graphic and unsentimental, Coyote reveals the corrosive side of love that was once called &amp;#147;free&amp;#8221;; the anxieties and occasional terrors of late-night, drug-fueled visits of biker gangs looking to party; and his own quest for the next high. His road through revolution brought him to adulthood and to his major role as a political strategist: from radical communard to the chairman of the California Arts Council, from a street theater apprentice to a motion-picture star.&lt;/div&gt;" />
