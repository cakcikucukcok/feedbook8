  <title>Wayne&#39;s World of Physics - Carrel W. Uptergrove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My lifetime of study about the universe, the stars with their rainbow of colors, the galaxies with their rainbow of colors, and black holes with the emissions of hydrogen and helium from their polar regions gave me a wonderful concept of the universe which I wish to share with the world.  
     In the book I have written I am proudest of Figure 3. &quot;Plots the 410.2nm with energy levels from one to 
five x 10 to the minus 19 J&quot;.  At first I thought I would need a super computer to generate the figure but a little thinking made me realize that I could generate it without the super computer.
     If you follow the 12 billion light years vertically until it intersects the curved line depicting emission wavelengths you will see a 695 nm entry at that point.  It tells you what the emission wavelength will be from the rainbow of colors emitted by any star or galaxy at that distance from the earth when it reaches the earth. 
     I am aware that many stars and galaxies are receding from us which gives a red shift to the rainbow of colors emitted by the stars. I have never read that cosmologists credit the Compton effect as also giving a red shift to the stars and the two have the same effect and therefore they credit non existence recessionary speed to the change in wavelength to the rainbow of colors from almost all stars.  The Compton effect is a DISTANCE indicator and not a RECESSIONARY indicator.
     Among the things I hope the reader will learn and enjoy is the fact that the moon travels around the world 
from west to east instead of east to west.  The moon contributes a powerful force to the ocean current around the world and through the Indian ocean, which alters ocean levels greatly, and is the reason Holland needs dikes.
