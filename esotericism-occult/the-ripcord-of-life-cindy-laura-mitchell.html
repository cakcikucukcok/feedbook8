  <title>The Ripcord of Life - Cindy Laura Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hot tears were streaming down Symanthas face, making it difficult to focus her gaze on the fading lights across the river spread out in front of her. A scene she and her beloved had grown to love over these last six months. 
I promise you, my darling, when we are married, every Friday night, we will come to this very place, take in the magnificent view, and then go on to that hotel there, see? He had said, pointing across to the dancing lights that shone over the river. 
Her attention was attracted once more by the glinting of her ring. An anguished cry escaped from her lips, the pain in her chest too much to bear, and through the curtain of tears that were beginning to form once more, she saw a shadow of what looked like her beloved standing in front of her. 
Oh, Toney, you came back! I knew you would, she laughed gaily, rubbing the moisture away from her eyes. Now the three of us can be together. She put out her hands to welcome him; a bright smile lighting up her face as she curled herself into his body and jumped off the cliffs into the churning river below." />
