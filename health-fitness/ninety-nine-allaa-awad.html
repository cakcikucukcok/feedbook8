  <title>Ninety-Nine - Allaa Awad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At times, we are blessed with the simple life. We glide effortlessly through our days, upward and onward. Unfortunately, we rarely look closely at what is guiding us. Usually, what guides us is not enough to sustain the joyful simplicity we see. We overlook the true meaning of existence and how we are being directed, much to our detriment.
Then there are the realists. They see life for the miracle it is. They surrender to a greater power with no filter, open to the worlds full potential. Yet, there is only one who can call forth the ninety-nine names, and that one is God. He is the real key to finding the truth of our hearts, where we came from, and the purpose we serve.
In the span of ninety-nine poems of love, find connection to a higher power. Find the truth of Gods attributes within you and the realm in which we live. Understand things you have never understood before. Your faith in the greater good denotes the strength of your character. Now, read, reflect, worship, and let the words sink in." />
