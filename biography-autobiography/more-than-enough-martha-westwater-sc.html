  <title>More Than Enough - Martha Westwater Sc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is it that makes most of us resist change? In this book, Martha Westwater takes her readers through the tumultuous times after Vatican II, when centuries-old assumptions about what constituted holiness were challenged. The churchs call for renewal invited women religious to discover again the roots of their call and the urgency of the needs of that time. Martha shares how she and the sisters with whom she lives seek to move into the future with integrity and passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in every life there is a single moment of insight that defines the souls journey more than any other. For Martha, it occurred on October 9, 1997. The twist of fate that allowed Martha to survive a horrific car crash while her two companions died gnawed at her as she wrestled with every survivors question: Why me? Why did I live? You will discover that the answer is something only the one who asks the question can articulate. More than Enough: Seeing Change as Blessing challenges each of us to reflect on our own life and recognize that we have always had enough of what we need for happiness. The author uses both wisdom and wit to explore how God accompanies us through every change and uses them to bless our lifes journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
