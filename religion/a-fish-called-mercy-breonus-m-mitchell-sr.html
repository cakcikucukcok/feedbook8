  <title>A Fish Called Mercy - Breonus M. Mitchell Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The reality is that there is not an individual living that has not made some bad choices - the wrong relationship, the wrong career, the wrong city  you name it. We each know what it feels like to come short of the glory of God. We each know what it feels like to hear the voice of God command of us one thing and choose to do the complete opposite. We each know what it feels like to suffer the consequences of choosing not His will but our will. If this is where you are  you are not alone.
The reality, however, is that we cannot park in the lot of our past poor choices. What we have to acknowledge is that even in the grasp of guilt and the environment of embarrassment; we are never in a place where God will not give us the opportunity to start over. So, though your present place may be the most undesirable and unwanted; it is an incredible place where God is going to show you mercy.
God does that, you know? He provides mercy in some of the most unimaginable and incomprehensible ways:
      a woman caught in the act of adultery
      a King that is a murderer and an adulterer
      a trickster like Jacob
      on the backside of a desert to a murderer
      a disciple that denied him and left him to die
      and even in the belly of a great fish.
So accept this invitation to journey through the chapters of a small book in the Old Testament  Jonah. Jonah is not some lonely creature afar offs in the ages somewhere, having an experience that is unique and incommunicable. The experience of Jonah is the experience of every believer. 
In this book, Pastor Breonus M. Mitchell Sr. empowers and encourages those who know the peril and pain of intentional disobedience to God.  Join him on an expository journey through the small prophetic book of Jonah, as he encourages us to experience the mercy of God even in the most demeaning and difficult places. This place in your life is not for your demise. It is just a place in which God provides a detour to direct you back to His will.
That is Jonahs testimony. That is his story. While others would have found the belly of the fish the most undesirable place  it was a place of provision and protection. It was a place of prayer and praise. God provided mercy for Jonah in the form of a fish . . .  a fish he likes to call - Mercy." />
