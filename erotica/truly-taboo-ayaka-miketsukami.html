  <title>Truly Taboo - Ayaka Miketsukami</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Slice of life about the twins of the Akahito family. Set in a school environment in Osaka. Each chapter narrates a character&amp;#39;s Point Of View, exploring their inner desires and thoughts. Since young, they both want each other as a lover but cannot deny being siblings. Emotional feelings crash into them for every boundary they break. True romance, true love; Truly Taboo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
INTRO&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I loved her moans. She&amp;rsquo;s so delicate, it just makes me want to spoil her more. We never planned it that way. It happened before we realize. We were young, probably too young to understand. Now that I think back, I really wanted to know do you love me for who I am?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER 1&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Walking back and forth in the living room for about four times, I finally sit on the sofa. Calming my nerves and return to my cool mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Why are you closing your eyes when watching TV?&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;My point isn&amp;rsquo;t watching TV,&amp;rdquo; oh no I can feel an excitement stacking up.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Curled up like a ball, her knees are near her chest meanwhile both her hands support the glass cup. Her lips touching the glass, it looks soft. I want her. I want her now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER 2&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I shouted, &amp;ldquo;I said I was fine so I am fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Saying that out loud appear more stressed than I thought. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to shout at you. He gets up from the chair and faces the direction to the door. Expeditiously, I hug him from the back, arms tightly holding on his torso and resting my head on his back. What am I doing? He must think I&amp;rsquo;m crazy. I&amp;rsquo;m choking off crying and couldn&amp;rsquo;t say a word. We stay like this for a minute until he decides to turn around. I was so ready for a kiss from him, the bed is just two steps away. Ryo says...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER 3 PART I&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m desperate to make her mine. I just want to lock her up so nobody can harm her and drown in her essence and moans. In the middle of that we hear footsteps approaching the nurse&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Someone&amp;rsquo;s coming,&amp;rdquo; I say to her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; She pulls me by the shirt, &amp;ldquo;Better minimize our volume then,&amp;rdquo; seductively replying. Our rhythm continued but the moans and groans reduced as I hydrate her lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The high heel steps are clearer and louder to hear until the nurse walks in. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve called your home and nobody is answering, you think you can make home by yourself today?&amp;rdquo; the nurse seems to be talking with someone. There is somebody in here!?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OUTRO&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Once we get home, I prepare the shower for Ryo. I kneel to get the towels underneath the wash basin. As I stand up, the reflection of the mirror shows my brother&amp;rsquo;s figure. My eyebrow flinches and in a swift speed he hugs me. It has been plenty of times that he hugged me this way, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but my heart is beating faster than lightning louder than thunder. His face is so near mine and he kisses on the pulse of my neck. His affectionate kiss sends a chill down to my spinal cord. &amp;ldquo;You need to bath me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
