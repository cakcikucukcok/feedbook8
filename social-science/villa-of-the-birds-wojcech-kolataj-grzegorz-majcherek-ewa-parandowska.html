  <title>Villa of the Birds - Wojcech Kolataj, Grzegorz Majcherek, Ewa Parandowska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fascinating book describes the excavation and preservation of three early Roman villas in Egypt&#39;s ancient port city of Alexandria. Chronicling the work of the Polish Archaeological Mission in Alexandria, &lt;em&gt;Villa of the Birds&lt;/em&gt; is an engaging and informative account of how these ancient dwellings were unearthed, and how the famous mosaic floors were brought to light two thousand years after they were laid.
With the expert guidance of the archaeologists responsible for the excavation, the reader is led through layers of clues reaching ten meters below today&#39;s street level, and to an in-depth appreciation of this extraordinary site&#39;s rich history.
Drawing directly on their work with the Polish Archeological Mission, the authors describe in detail the excavation of the housing areas, as well as the baths, the gymnasia, and the theater that comprise the villa complex.
&lt;em&gt;Villa of the Birds&lt;/em&gt; reconstructs not only the villas themselves, with their magnificent mosaics, but also the history of how they were built and used, and ultimately how they were destroyed by fire. The book is richly illustrated with detailed floor plans as well as spectacular color photographs of the mosaics themselves.
