  <title>Stone Field, True Arrow - Kyoko Mori</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maya Ishida is no stranger to sorrow. Torn from her artist father in her native Japan, raised by her cold, ambitious mother in Minneapolis, she has finally put together a life with few disruptions: a safe marriage and a quiet life weaving clothes in a country studio. The past is no more than a story she vaguely remembers; the present is a gray landscape of solitary pleasures and modest expectations.&lt;br&gt;After her father dies, Maya is pulled back into the memory of their parting. In his many stories of Orpheus and Eurydice and of the &lt;i&gt;tennyo&lt;/i&gt;, a mythic Japanese figure, he had taught her that love means making the sacrifice of letting go. And so she had walked away from him without looking back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four years later, holding her father&#39;s last sketch, Maya knows she can avoid looking back no longer. She must question her placid marriage, her decision not to become an artist, and even the precarious peace she has made with her mother before she can be released--to feel passion, risk change, and fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyoko Mori&#39;s young adult novel, &lt;i&gt;Shizuko&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt;, was hailed in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; as &quot;a jewel...one of those rarities that shine out only a few times in a generation.&quot; In &lt;i&gt;Stone Field, True Arrow&lt;/i&gt;, her first novel for adults, she sheds brilliant light on eternal questions about life and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
