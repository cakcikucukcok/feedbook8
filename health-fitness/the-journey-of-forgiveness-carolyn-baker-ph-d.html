  <title>The Journey of Forgiveness - Carolyn Baker Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;THE JOURNEY OF FORGIVENESS: Fulfilling The Healing Process&lt;/I&gt;, first and foremost, emphasizes the process nature of forgiveness. The author, a former psychotherapist, has come to believe that forgiveness is not an event willed by an ego which desires to be free of guilt, which may long for connection with those who have harmed oneself, or which hopes to comply with the admonitions modern awareness gurus. Rather, forgiveness, the author insists, is a conscious journey requiring a thorough knowledge of the offense(s) and its effects, as well as the most essential pre-requisite, self-forgiveness. The book offers a compassionate yet courageous challenge to look deeply into the wounds inflicted, the emotional and spiritual effects of the wounds, and the psyche of the offender(s) in order to enter and complete what is nothing less than a daunting rite of passage. The author&#39;s style, poignant, poetic, and frequently disturbing, relentlessly dispels all illusions of quick-fix forgiveness but offers supportive, no-nonsense exercises for embarking on a life-changing, transformative journey." />
