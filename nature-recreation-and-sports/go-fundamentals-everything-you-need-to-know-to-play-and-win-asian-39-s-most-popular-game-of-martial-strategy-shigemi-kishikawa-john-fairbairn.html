  <title>Go Fundamentals: Everything You Need to Know to Play and Win Asian&#39;s Most Popular Game of Martial Strategy - Shigemi Kishikawa, John Fairbairn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Go Fundamentals&lt;/I&gt; is the easy-to-follow guidebook explaining the fundamental principles of the ancient Asian game of Go, the oldest game in the world.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Go is a game played by two contestants. The game is played with black and white &quot;stones&quot; on a checkered board. The players are usually classed as strong and weak, based upon degree of knowledge and skill. The stronger player takes the white stones and the weaker player takes the black stones. Handicaps are given the weaker players by mutual agreement before commencement of the game. The game of go may be one of the most difficult to learn, but this fact makes the game highly interesting. Once techniques are mastered, the beginner will find it difficult to put the game aside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From the basic rules of play, the author leads beginner-level players in easy stages to the more advanced techniques and strategies of gameplay. Over one hundred diagrams, with twenty problems and answers, a glossary of terms as well as other resources for strategy, make this a complete introduction to one of the most fascinating and rewarding games in the world.&lt;/div&gt;" />
