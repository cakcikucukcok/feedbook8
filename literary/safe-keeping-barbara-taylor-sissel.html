  <title>Safe Keeping - Barbara Taylor Sissel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;At the heart of every crime, there&#39;s a family…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My son is a murderer…. So begins this chilling and emotionally charged mystery from highly acclaimed author Barbara Taylor Sissel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emily Lebay had always thought of her family as ordinary. Sure, they&#39;ve endured their share of problems, even a time of great trouble–what family hasn&#39;t? But when a woman&#39;s body turns up in the dense woods near their home, and Emily&#39;s grown son, Tucker, is accused of murder, Emily is forced to confront the unfathomable, and everything she believed about her life is called into question.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t the first time Tucker has been targeted by the police; a year ago he was a person of interest when another woman was found dead in the same stretch of woods. Still, neither Emily nor her daughter, Lissa, can reconcile their Tucker with these brutal crimes. Terrified, convinced there&#39;s been a tragic mistake, Emily and Lissa set out to learn the truth about Tucker, once and for all. And while his life hangs in the balance, what they discover proves far more shocking than their darkest fears….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;A gut-wrenching mystery…enjoyable and insightful.&quot; –RT Book Reviews on Evidence of Life&lt;/p&gt;
