  <title>Adam&#39;s Rib - Antonio Manzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Black Run&lt;/em&gt; comes Antonio Manzini&amp;#8217;s mesmerizing second mystery novel featuring detective Rocco Schiavone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months after being exiled from his beloved Rome, Deputy Police Chief Rocco Schiavone has settled into a routine in the cold, quiet, chronically backward alpine town of Aosta: an espresso at home, breakfast in the piazza, and a morning joint in his office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little self-medication helps Rocco deal with the morons that almost exclusively comprise the local force. Especially on a day like today. It&amp;#8217;s his girlfriend&amp;#8217;s birthday (if you could call her that; in his mind, Rocco&amp;#8217;s only faithful to his late wife), he has no gift&amp;#8212;and he&amp;#8217;s about to stumble upon a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It begins when a maid reports a burglary in Aosta. But there&amp;#8217;s no sign of forced entry, and after Rocco picks the lock, he notices something off about the carefully ransacked rooms. That&amp;#8217;s when he finds the body: a woman, the maid&amp;#8217;s employer, left hanging after a grisly suicide. Or is it? Rocco&amp;#8217;s intuition tells him the scene has been staged. In other words, it&amp;#8217;s murder&amp;#8212;a pain in the ass of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this stylish international mystery, Antonio Manzini further establishes Rocco Schiavone as one of the most acerbic, complicated, and entertaining antiheroes crime fiction has seen in years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
