  <title>Sun Power - Neville Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;America is on the brink of a green energy revolution that can save the planet, and increase peace and prosperity, by harnessing the unlimited solar power. After decades of promise, the technology for alternative energy solutions now exists to replace our dangerous addiction to fossil fuels with cheap, clean solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neville Williams has been on the leading edge of this revolution for decades and knows from firsthand experience how sun power can transform lives and communities for the better. He has traveled the globe bringing solar-generated electricity to struggling communities throughout Asia, Africa, India, and the developing world. From isolated villages high in the mountains of Nepal to remote settlements in South Africa, Williams has worked to bring sun power to even the most off-the-grid reaches of the planet. He has brought that knowledge and experience back to America where he founded one of the country&#39;s fastest growing solar companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If millions of poor families in the Third World can get their power from the sun, why can&#39;t Americans concerned with their rising power bills, dependence on foreign oil, and carbon footprints do the same?&lt;br&gt;The answer is that sun power is here, it works, and can light up a new era of economic and environmental security--if we have the will to seize this historic opportunity. This book is not about predictions or promises. It&#39;s about &lt;i&gt;what&#39;s happening now, &lt;/i&gt;all over the world, and what still needs to done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
