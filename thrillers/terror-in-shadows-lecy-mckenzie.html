  <title>Terror in  Shadows - Lecy McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Terror in the Shadows:  Sometimes the one thing that frightens you the most is the one thing you have been looking for all your life.
The Terror Is Here!  Terror in the Shadows, a new suspense thriller by Horror Novelist Lecy McKenzie Pritchett, will keep you riveted and promises to be filled with bone chilling terror and heart stopping surprises until the very end.  Four couples begin a dream vacation that very quickly spins into a nightmare.  One of them is in for some life altering changes, and the realization that horror can be watching for you from the shadows, or maybe not?
Alicia Martin was forewarned.  A premonition, a sixth sense, a warning from some inner most human desire for survival, an uneasy feeling that this trip could very well be their last, a revelation of doom coming from deep within her soul, but unable to share these feelings for fear of her inability to tell anyone where they were coming from.  Choosing  to ignore these warnings, instead following her husband and friends to a mountain paradise, she will soon find the beauty that surrounds them is the mask for evil that is more terrifying than anyone could have imagined or foreseen. 
Finding themselves the prey of four demented brothers, who seemed to have crept up from the depths of hell, inhuman, and twisted beyond compare, languishing in the humiliation, deprivation, and horror they inflict on others, with a thirst for blood that is unimaginable, and a lust that will stop at nothing to quench that desire.  The group soon finds themselves stalked and tormented, the pawns of a deadly twist of fate, being led into a wilderness that none may have the ability to survive. Unable to defend themselves against a formidable foe, with their only hope a mysterious shadow watching from a distance.  Alicia is about to realize that the one that could be their salvation is the one thing that nothing could have prepared her for.
A must read, hang in for the spine chilling ending that will prove a nightmare is only a dream of things that are meant to be." />
