  <title>Liberty&#39;s Dawn - Art Theocles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Liberty Trilogy contemplates the fragility of freedom and liberty by taking its readers on a fictional adventure through American history. Political and economic circumstance, patriotism, and faith guide the main characters through their unnatural journey. The first book, &lt;i&gt;Libertys Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, occurs during the 1780-1781 years of the revolutionary conflict in North Americas southern colonies. In &lt;i&gt;Libertys Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, three friends embark on a winter camping trip in the mountains of South Carolina, to escape the stark realities and absurdities of modern society. They have planned a weekend of camp fires, good eating, and target shooting at an outdoor rifle and pistol range. Abruptly, on the first days hike, an unseen force thrusts them back in time to witness the fall of Charleston to British forces loyal to King George in late spring of the year 1780. How did the friends get here? Why are they here? What should they do now? Nik, Sid, and John must wrestle with these questions and ultimately find their way as history unfolds before them. American history is Niks passion and seeing the Revolutionary war is like watching a living history of the events he has studied most of his life. John is an avid outdoorsman and Sid is a computer professional with previous contacts throughout the US military. The friends soon discover an evil from Americas past is in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Will liberty and freedom expire before it takes root? Will evil triumph?&lt;/p&gt;" />
