  <title>Shadow Lessons: The Unexpected Journey of an Inner City Art Teacher - Daniel Bonnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine waking up one morning at age fifty. You&#39;re a noted, published artist whose work hangs all over the world. Then imagine finding yourself standing in front of thirty-five at-risk African American high school students in an inner-city classroom in one of the most difficult high schools in the country.  It&#39;s your job to teach them, and you&#39;ve never taught a day in your life.  This is the story of an artist who did just that. It is a moving story of a middle-aged white artist who dared to venture into the inner city of Savannah, Georgia, and attempt to teach in one of the first all-black high schools for children of freed slaves in America. Yet Shadow Lessons is not another teacher saves the day book. It is a story of beauty and ugliness, life and death, joy and sorrow, laughter and despair.   Shadow Lessons takes us beyond the classroom on a compelling journey of compassion, healing, and transformation." />
