  <title>Black Girl,/White Girl - Joyce Carol Oates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, in 1975, Genna Hewett-Meade&#39;s college roommate died a mysterious, violent, terrible death. Minette Swift had been a fiercely individualistic scholarship student, an assertive&amp;#8212;even prickly&amp;#8212;personality, and one of the few black girls at an exclusive women&#39;s liberal arts college near Philadelphia. By contrast, Genna was a quiet, self-effacing teenager from a privileged upper-class home, self-consciously struggling to make amends for her own elite upbringing. When, partway through their freshman year, Minette suddenly fell victim to an increasing torrent of racist harassment and vicious slurs&amp;#8212;from within the apparent safety of their tolerant, &quot;enlightened&quot; campus&amp;#8212;Genna felt it her duty to protect her roommate at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as Genna reconstructs the months, weeks, and hours leading up to Minette&#39;s tragic death, she is also forced to confront her own identity within the social framework of that time. Her father was a prominent civil defense lawyer whose radical politics&amp;#8212;including defending anti-war terrorists wanted by the FBI&amp;#8212;would deeply affect his daughter&#39;s outlook on life, and later challenge her deepest beliefs about social obligation in a morally gray world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Girl / White Girl&lt;/em&gt; is a searing double portrait of &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white,&quot; of race and civil rights in post-Vietnam America, captured by one of the most important literary voices of our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
