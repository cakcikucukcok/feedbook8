  <title>Thoughts Out of Season, Part One - Friedrich Nietzsche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To the reader who knows Nietzsche, who has studied his Zarathustra and understood it, and who, in addition, has digested the works entitled&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Beyond Good and Evil&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Genealogy of Morals&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Twilight of the Idols&lt;/i&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Antichrist&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;mdash; to such a reader everything in this volume will be perfectly clear and comprehensible. In the attack on Strauss he will immediately detect the germ of the whole of Nietzsche&amp;#39;s subsequent attitude towards too hasty contentment and the foolish beatitude of the &amp;quot;easily pleased&amp;quot;; in the paper on Wagner he will recognise Nietzsche the indefatigable borer, miner and underminer, seeking to define his ideals, striving after self-knowledge above all, and availing himself of any contemporary approximation to his ideal man, in order to press it forward as the incarnation of his thoughts. Wagner the reformer of mankind! Wagner the dithyrambic dramatist!&amp;mdash;The reader who knows Nietzsche will not be misled by these expressions.&lt;br /&gt;
To the uninitiated reader, however, some words of explanation are due, not only in regard to the two papers before us, but in regard to Nietzsche himself. So much in our time is learnt from hearsay concerning prominent figures in science, art, religion, or philosophy, that it is hardly possible for anybody to-day, however badly informed he may be, to begin the study of any great writer or scientist with a perfectly open mind. It were well, therefore, to begin the study of Nietzsche with some definite idea as to his unaltered purpose, if he ever possessed such a thing; as to his lifelong ideal, if he ever kept one so long; and as to the one direction in which he always travelled, despite apparent deviations and windings. Had he such a purpose, such an ideal, such a direction? We have no wish to open a controversy here, neither do we think that in replying to this question in the affirmative we shall give rise to one; for every careful student of Nietzsche, we know, will uphold us in our view. Nietzsche had one very definite and unaltered purpose, ideal and direction, and this was &amp;quot;the elevation of the type man.&amp;quot; He tells us in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Will to Power&lt;/i&gt;: &amp;quot;All is truth to me that tends to elevate man!&amp;quot; To this principle he was already pledged as a student at Leipzig; we owe every line that he ever wrote to his devotion to it, and it is the key to all his complexities, blasphemies, prolixities, and terrible earnestness. All was good to Nietzsche that tended to elevate man; all was bad that kept man stationary or sent him backwards. Hence he wrote&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;David Strauss&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;the Confessor and Writer&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1873).&lt;br /&gt;
The Franco-German War had only just come to an end, and the keynote of this polemical pamphlet is, &amp;quot;Beware of the intoxication of success.&amp;quot; When the whole of Germany was delirious with joy over her victory, at a time when the unquestioned triumph of her arms tended rather to reflect unearned glory upon every department of her social organisation, it required both courage and discernment to raise the warning voice and to apply the wet blanket. But Nietzsche did both, and with spirit, because his worst fears were aroused. Smug content (&lt;i&gt;erb&amp;auml;rmliches Behagen&lt;/i&gt;) was threatening to thwart his one purpose&amp;mdash;the elevation of man; smug content personified in the German scholar was giving itself airs of omniscience, omnipotence, and ubiquity, and all the while it was a mere cover for hidden rottenness and jejune pedantry..." />
