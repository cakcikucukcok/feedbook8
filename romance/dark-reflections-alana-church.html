  <title>Dark Reflections - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After days of a strange sexual reawakening, Rachel Wainwright finally meets the reason for the wonderful change in her life. Althea Carpenter is a succubus who has been forced to take up residence in her mind. As she explains her history, and that of the succubi, Rachel is filled with sympathy for her plight, and agrees to help her regain her previous form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, the spell of the succubus is having an effect on other members of Rachel&amp;#39;s household. Rachel&amp;#39;s son Alex finds love and acceptance in Maria&amp;#39;s arms. And Rachel&amp;#39;s daughter Sarah is being drawn to a new man in her life. Will they find happiness together? One thing is certain. When you look into the eyes of a succubus, you may see some...Dark Reflections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a start, Rachel opened her eyes. She was lying on her back. The covers had been pulled down to lie in a crumpled heap at the foot of the bed. Morning sunlight poured through the open windows, and the cotton curtains swayed in a soft spring breeze. More importantly, her husband was kissing her. From the warm feeling in her chest and groin, he had been arousing her for some time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, this is a wonderful way to wake up,&amp;rdquo; she murmured softly. She smiled down at her long-time lover and best friend. &amp;ldquo;Looking for someplace to hide your morning wood?&amp;rdquo; she teased.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Josh raised himself on his arms, moving forward so he could give her another good-morning kiss. &amp;ldquo;Amazing thing, the male body,&amp;rdquo; he said, when their lips parted. &amp;ldquo;No matter how many times you make love to a beautiful woman, it can&amp;#39;t wait to do it again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled at the compliment, looping her arms around his neck and drawing him down to her. How long had it been since they had spent a lazy morning in bed? Years, perhaps. For the first time in far too long, there were no urgent needs driving her. No cases to prepare for, no witnesses to depose, no briefs to write and file. If she and Josh wished, they could spend all day in bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~Ooh, that sounds nice. Yes, let&amp;#39;s do that.~ Althea said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be quiet, you, Rachel said. Can&amp;#39;t you leave me alone for a while?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~Actually, no. I can&amp;#39;t. That&amp;#39;s kind of the point of this whole exercise, isn&amp;#39;t it? And just remember, the more you make love to Joshua, the quicker you will have the mental privacy you desire. Until then, get used to having company.~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She dragged her nails up his back, tickling her husband, watching through hooded lids as his back arched under her touch. God, I&amp;#39;ve missed this. The feeling of power, even when he&amp;#39;s on top of me, seemingly in control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~Being a woman is wonderful, is it not? At least, when you control your own destiny. This is why my mother spurned Adam and God. She would not allow herself to become subordinate. A tool to be used.~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tell me, she asked, is this thing with our secretions...catching? If Jeremy makes love to another woman, would she be affected?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~What, are you worried about mankind catching a case of universal horniness, as if it were some sort of awesome venereal disease?~ Althea&amp;#39;s voice was teasing. ~Fortunately, no. It would have happened way before now. We are a lusty bunch, although there aren&amp;#39;t many of us. You don&amp;#39;t have to be worried about being Patient Zero in the great Sex Plague of 2016.~" />
