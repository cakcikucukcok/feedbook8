  <title>Give the Devil His Due - Sulari Gentill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Rowland Sinclair is invited to take his yellow Mercedes onto the Maroubra Speedway, popularly known as the Killer Track, he agrees without caution or reserve.
But then people start to die...
The body of a journalist covering the race is found in a House of Horrors, an English blueblood with Blackshirt affiliations is killed on the race track… and it seems that someone has Rowland in their sights.
A strange young reporter preoccupied with black magic, a mysterious vagabond,  an up-and-coming actor by the name of Flynn, and ruthless bookmakers all add mayhem to the mix.
With danger presenting at every turn, and the brakes long since disengaged, Rowland Sinclair hurtles towards disaster with an artist, a poet and brazen sculptress along for the ride." />
