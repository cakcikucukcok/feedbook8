  <title>The Silence That Speaks (Forensic Instincts, Book 4) - Andrea Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;WHO WANTS MADELINE WESTFIELD DEAD? AND WHY?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forensic Instincts&#39; first order of business is to find out who&#39;s targeting their client. Under the leadership of Casey Woods, the investigative team has the resources to do just that, working inside the law–and outside it. FI&#39;s strength is its members, among them Casey&#39;s associate Marc Devereaux, former navy SEAL and a man who&#39;s equal to any situation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except maybe this one…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Madeline&#39;s case hits too close to home for Marc. She&#39;s the only woman he ever loved, and she&#39;s his only weakness. Now a nurse at Manhattan Memorial, she&#39;s terrified because someone is trying to kill her. So she turns, reluctantly, to Marc and FI for help and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Manhattan Memorial is in turmoil. With a merger in the works, the staff is still haunted by their hospital administrator&#39;s sudden death–during heart surgery performed by Madeline&#39;s ex-husband, Conrad. A surgery at which Madeline was present. The killer seems to blame both Madeline and Conrad…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a growing list of suspects–including the grieving widow and a string of scorned lovers–Forensic Instincts will have to figure out who has the greatest incentive to get rid of Madeline. And FI has to work fast to save her…before she&#39;s permanently silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
