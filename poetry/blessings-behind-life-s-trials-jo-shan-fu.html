  <title>Blessings Behind Life’S Trials - Jo Shan Fu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing in this life is permanent, and our strength is constantly being tested by trials. Yet Allah is there for us when we need Him: our prayers to Him help us see that life is an awesome gift. This books verses ponder the difficulties of life and how we can accept them through faith. They mingle sincere personal reflection with an awareness of the simplicity and beauty of a life lived well. 
The sincerity in the writing is not a dead weight of seriousness, but is the life behind the poems. Jo Shan has presented a personal view on her faith that is quite interesting in a world where others often have very simplified views of Islam. 
Stiofn  Maoilbhreannain, Editor, Occams Eraser, Dublin, Ireland 
POEMS are short phrases but contain powerful messages. Those who write them should know and those who read them could feel. Jo Shan shares her thoughts about what it is to OVERCOME, ACCEPT, REFLECT, ENCOURAGE, and EULOGIZE on the challenges of becoming a Muslim, especially for someone like her who meets Islam and thereafter decided to embrace it as her lifes destiny. Her collection of poems, penned under the title BLESSINGS BEHIND LIFES TRIALS bears testimony to her journey in discovering how Islam makes all the sense to her in her human meaning and becoming. 
Yamin Cheng, Lecturer in Usuluddin and Comparative Religion, International Islamic University Malaysia, Malaysia 
Seeking success for the next world as a believer in this world is a constant struggle fraught with seemingly endless tribulations. Sister Jo Shans evocative poetry brings words of peace and comfort in this tumultuous world and reminds us that the struggle may be hard, but the guidance and strength of Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala is there for us. In poems such as Imperfection and Ring the Changes, she meets the challenges of the world (dunya) and casts them back, reminding us of their ephemeral nature. She brings us back to the ultimate meaning of our struggle. In poems such as Love in Life and Life Mark, she reminds of the many blessings we already receive from the Almighty. These blessings are at times too easily dismissed in a hectic world, but Sister Jo Shans poems cry out to us not let go of the many generous gifts that Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala has graciously bestowed upon us all. This anthology will gladden your heart and speak to you of the peace and solace that await, InshaAllah.
