  <title>Tales of Rabia Al Adawiyya the Great Female Muslim Sufi Saint from Basra - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Running with fire in one hand and water in the other, Rabia explained, “I am going to burn paradise and douse hellfire so that both veils may be lifted from those on the quest, and they will become sincere of purpose. God’s servants will learn to see Him without hope for reward or fear of punishment. As it is now, if you took away hope for reward or fear of punishment, no one would obey.”
This was the mentality of the most famous female Sufi saint, Rabia al-Adawiyya, who set forth the doctrine of Divine Love. She maintained praises of God weren’t meant to be merely performed with the tongue, ears, eyes, hands, or feet — but with the wakeful heart.
“O Sons of Adam, from the eye, there is no way-station to the Real. From the tongue, there is no path to Him. Hearing is the highway of complainers. Hand and foot dwell in perplexity. The matter falls to the heart. Strive for a wakeful heart.” (Rabia al-Adawiyya)" />
