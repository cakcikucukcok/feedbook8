  <title>Natural Peoples and ecospirituality - Rosalba Nattero, Giancarlo Barbadoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the Native Americans&amp;rsquo; Mount Graham case to the historical reality of the Native Europeans, a peace proposal for all humanity. With contributions from Ola Cassadore. With the encouragement of the UNITED NATIONS Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.&lt;br /&gt;
--------------&lt;br /&gt;
The Authors&lt;br /&gt;
---&lt;br /&gt;
Giancarlo Barbadoro and Rosalba Nattero are representatives of six indigenous organizations from all continents. They are actively involved in many initiatives for the survival of the culture of all the Indigenous people around the world, as well as being amongst the prime supporters of the Ecospirituality Foundation, an international organization in Consultative Status with the United Nations founded by Native Americans, Australians and Europeans, that bases it&amp;rsquo;s work upon Indigenous people related thematics.&lt;br /&gt;
For years Giancarlo Barbadoro and Rosalba Nattero, on behalf of the Ecospirituality Foundation, along with the aid of the United Nations, continue the struggle for the preservation of the sacred places and of the traditions of Natural peoples.&lt;br /&gt;
Both journalists, musicians, writers and radio-television speakers, are members of the musical group called LabGraal that is dedicated to the divulgation of the musical patrimony of the Celtic tradition.&lt;br /&gt;
Devoted researchers of the topics of celtism and antique Indigenous cultures, they are authors of numerous texts on the subject. The book Natural Peoples and Ecospirituality, translated in several languages, was presented at the UN in New York and Geneva and in conferences and meetings in Europe, USA and Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
---&lt;br /&gt;
Ola Cassadore, the late chairperson of the Apache Survival Coalition, the leading movement in defense of Mount Graham, has spent all her life defending the sacred mountain of all Apache people today desecrated.&lt;br /&gt;
The Mount Graham case serves as a symbol bringing us face to face with the culture and religion of Natural Peoples. These peoples have developed their own spirituality outside the context of the mass religions known to history and present an example of unity and common reference to Nature and the Mystery it reveals. Common respect for Nature leads to a demonstration of brotherhood amongst peoples and a natural religion shared by all the World&amp;rsquo;s Natural Peoples. Here we have a lesson in peace and progress that humanity cannot afford to underestimate." />
