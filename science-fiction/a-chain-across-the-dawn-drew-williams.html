  <title>A Chain Across the Dawn - Drew Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drew Williams continues the Universe After series with &lt;i&gt;A Chain Across the Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, an epic space opera chase across the galaxy with witty banter, fantastical planets, and a seemingly unbeatable foe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The only thing more fun than a bonkers space battle is a whole book packed with bonkers space battles. Come for the exploding spaceships, stay for the intriguing universe.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Becky Chambers, on &lt;i&gt;The Stars Now Unclaimed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been three years since Esa left her backwater planet to join the ranks of the Justified. Together, she and fellow agent Jane Kamali have been traveling across the known universe, searching for children who share Esa&#39;s supernatural gifts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a visit to a particularly remote planet, they learn that they&#39;re not the only ones searching for gifted children. They find themselves on the tail of a mysterious being with impossible powers who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the very children that Esa and Jane are trying to save. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With their latest recruit in tow--a young Wulf boy named Sho--Esa and Jane must track their strange foe across the galaxy in search of answers. But the more they learn, the clearer it becomes--their enemy may be harder to defeat than they ever could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
