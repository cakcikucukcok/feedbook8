  <title>Besieged - Bertrice Small</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bertrice Small writes exciting love stories that introduce readers to magnificent historic locales and memorable characters. In her newest book, &lt;i&gt;Besieged&lt;/i&gt;, she continues her thrilling 17th century saga, &lt;i&gt;Skye&#39;s Legacy,&lt;/i&gt; with the moving tale of Jasmine&#39;s younger daughter, a courageous beauty determined to follow her heart.  .  ..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Besieged&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly a spinster at twenty, Fortune Lindley is leaving Scotland to return to her birthplace at Maguire&#39;s Ford, a vast Ulster estate that she will inherit only if she marries an Irish Protestant. To that end, Fortune has agreed to consider a match with the Protestant aristocrat William Devers, a man suited to her wealth and status. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Besieged&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it is the rebellious and disinherited Catholic elder brother, Kiernan Devers, who steals her heart, driving William to a black and murderous fury. While Fortune and Kiernan&#39;s forbidden ecstasy explodes, jealousy and intolerance lead to an unthinkable tragedy--and a destiny that will test Fortune&#39;s will to survive in a struggle to claim a land, a legacy, and the only love she&#39;ll have.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bertrice Small&lt;/b&gt; is the author of over twenty-four novels of historical romance. She is a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, and the recipient of numerous awards. In keeping with her profession, Bertrice Small lives in the oldest English-speaking town in the state of New York, which was founded in 1640. Her light-filled studio is filled with the paintings of her favorite cover artist, Elaine Duillo; a large library; but no computer as she works on an IBM Quietwriter 7, and her long-time assistant, Judy Walker, types the final draft. Because she believes in happy endings, Bertrice Small has been married to the same man, her hero, George, for thirty-six years. They have a son, Thomas, a lovely daughter-in-law, Megan, and two adorable grandchildren, Chandler David and Cora Alexandra. Long-time readers will be happy to know that Nicki the Cockatiel flourishes, along with his cat housemates, Pookie, the long-haired griege and white, and Honeybun, the petite orange with the cream-colored paws." />
