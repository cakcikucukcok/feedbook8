  <title>Button and Bow - Susanna Jennicrai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An imaginary adventure tale with important lessons and concepts for young children. Enjoyable, attractive, and educational, this story can be enjoyed and treasured. 
Button and Bow were best friends and lived next door to each other. They always played together. One day, they made a secret plan; they decided to go on a journey to a nearby wood. They met some wild animals on their way who helped them to find it. A misunderstanding caused Bow to get lost inside the wood. Sadness followed. Suddenly and unexpectedly, help came literally from nowhere. The problem was solved, through care and kindness. Button and Bow found happiness again and learned an important lesson never to be forgotten!
A perfect gift for that special occasion in any childs life. 
Educational, fun, attractive, colorful, imaginative, innocuous. 
This story is suitable for boys and girls, especially the nursery/infant or lower Junior age range (four to seven years)." />
