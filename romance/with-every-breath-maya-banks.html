  <title>With Every Breath - Maya Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#1 USA Today &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Maya Banks continues her suspenseful and sizzling Slow Burn series with this fourth book&amp;#8212;a mesmerizingly sexy tale of a strong, brilliant woman who encounters the one man who makes her lose all control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliza Cummings fought free of a monster who terrorized her when she was an innocent teenager and helped put him away for good. She took a job with Devereaux Security Services and devoted every hour to taking down the very thing she&amp;#8217;d nearly become. No one, not even those closest to her, know her darkest, shameful secrets. But now the killer has been set free on a legal loophole and it&amp;#8217;s only a matter of time before he comes for her. Eliza&amp;#39;s only choice is to run and lead the monster away from the people she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wade Sterling has always lived by his own rules, a law unto himself who answers to no one. He&amp;#8217;s never professed to be a good man, and he&amp;#8217;s definitely &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;hero material. Wade never allows anyone close enough to see the man behind the impenetrable mask&amp;#8212;but one woman threatens his carefully leashed control. He took a bullet for her and the result was more than a piece of metal entrenched in his skin. She was under his skin and nothing he did rid himself of the woman with the courage of a warrior and who thinks nothing of putting her life before others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Wade sees a panicked and haunted Eliza he knows something is very wrong, because the fool woman has never been afraid of &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. And when she tries to run, the primal beast barely lurking beneath his deceptively polished fa&amp;#231;ade erupts in a rage. She may not know it, but she belongs to him. This time, Eliza isn&amp;#39;t going to play the protector. She was damn well going to be the protected. And as long as Wade breathes, no one will ever hurt what is his.&lt;/p&gt;" />
