  <title>The Magnificent Heresy - Royston Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The large ancient Egyptian Empire won by Thutmose III and his son, Amenhotep II, brought great wealth to Egypt. 
This legacy was squandered by the later pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty. The person chiefly responsible for its loss was Waenre Amenhotep IV, who always called himself by the name Akhanaten, being devoted to his God Aten, believing in a single God Aten, represented by the Solar Disc. His crime was to attempt to force that single God on his people and attempted to destroy their beliefs in the many Gods of Egypt worshipped for centuries by his people. An attempt that caused havoc in the Middle East. 
Since we now know some five hundred500 years must be deducted from the present chronology of Egypt after the thirteenth dynasty, we now know that he copied his idea from the beliefs of the Israelite people and their belief in the coming of a Messiah would bring eternal peace to the world. 
However, this deduction means we must re-write the history of Egypt and its relations with other countries. This book attempts to do this. Although it is written in a fictionalized form to increase your enjoyment, every event is historical accurate and did occur at that time as described. 
But it is also a story of the true love of their men and women. Though the morals of Egypt were very different from what we accept today, they did love each other." />
