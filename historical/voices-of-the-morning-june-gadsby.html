      <meta name="description" content="The last thing Patrick Flynn wants is another mouth to feed, so he does his best to ensure that Billy does not survive. But survive he does, with the help of a warm-hearted prostitute and Laura Caldwell, the daughter of a wealthy local family.

One day, he dreams, he will win her heart, but Laura has other ideas, and it is with Bridget, the prostitute’s daughter, that Billy joins the Jarrow crusaders marching to London to demonstrate against unemployment. Neither of them, however, is prepared for the reappearance of the evil Patrick Flynn… Written against the backdrop of the famous Jarrow March from Tyneside to London" />
