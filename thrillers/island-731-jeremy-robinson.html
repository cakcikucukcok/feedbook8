  <title>Island 731 - Jeremy Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Robinson puts his distinctive mark on Michael Crichton territory with this terrifying present-day riff on &lt;i&gt;The Island of Dr. Moreau&lt;/i&gt;... One of the best &lt;i&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/i&gt; successors.&quot; -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Hawkins, former park ranger and expert tracker, is out of his element, working on board the &lt;i&gt;Magellan&lt;/i&gt;, a research vessel studying the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. But his work is interrupted when, surrounded by thirty miles of refuse,  the ship and its high tech systems are plagued by a series of strange malfunctions and the crew is battered by a raging storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the storm fades and the sun rises, the beaten crew awakens to find themselves anchored in the protective cove of a tropical island...and no one knows how they got there. Even worse, the ship has been sabotaged, two crewman are dead and a third is missing. Hawkins spots signs of the missing man on shore and leads a small team to bring him back. But they quickly discover evidence of a brutal history left behind by the Island&#39;s former occupants: Unit 731, Japan&#39;s ruthless World War II human experimentation program. Mass graves and military fortifications dot the island, along with a decades old laboratory housing the remains of hideous experiments.&lt;br&gt;As crew members start to disappear, Hawkins realizes that they are not alone. In fact, they were brought to this strange and horrible island. The crew is taken one-by-one and while Hawkins fights to save his friends, he learns the horrible truth: Island 731 was never decommissioned and the person taking his crewmates may not be a person at all--not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;" />
