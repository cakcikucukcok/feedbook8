  <title>He Never Came Home: Interviews, Stories, and Essays from Daughters on Life Without Their Fathers - Regina R. Robertson, Joy-Ann Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;He Never Came Home&lt;/I&gt; is a collection of 22 personal essays written by girls and women who have been separated from their fathers by way of divorce, abandonment, or death. The contributors to this collection come from a wide range of different backgrounds in terms of race, socioeconomic status, religion, and geographic location. Their essays offer deep insights into the emotions related to losing one&amp;#8217;s father, including sadness, indifference, anger, acceptance&amp;#151;and everything in between.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book, edited by &lt;I&gt;Essence&lt;/I&gt; magazine&#39;s West Coast editor Regina R. Robertson, is first and foremost an offering to young girls and women who have endured the loss of their fathers. But it also speaks to mothers who are raising girls without a father present, offering important perspective into their daughter&#39;s feelings and struggles.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The essays in &lt;I&gt;He Never Came Home&lt;/I&gt; are organized into three categories: &quot;Divorce,&quot; &quot;Distant,&quot; and &quot;Deceased.&quot; With essays by contributors such as Emmy Award&amp;#150;winning actress &lt;B&gt;Regina King,&lt;/B&gt; fitness expert and &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; best-selling author &lt;B&gt;Gabby Reece,&lt;/B&gt; and television comedy writer &lt;B&gt;Jenny Lee,&lt;/B&gt; this anthology illustrates the journey of the fatherless, and provides a space for these writers to express their pain, hope, and healing&amp;#151;minus any judgments and without apology.&lt;/div&gt;" />
