  <title>Dancing with Butterflies - Dr. Gramps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dancing with butterflies is a beautiful allegory dramatizing the yearnings of three very brave butterflies named Zippy, Tippy and Flitty. They will be led to new heights of love, joy and victory. You will follow Jenny, who is offered an extraordinary adventure; it will be one that no other human has ever been able to take, a place called Butterfly Island. She will journey through difficult places with her three companions, as she overcomes her fears and passes through many dangers that will at last bring them to the end of their journey Crystal Mountain. Here she will experience the transformation that will take place by their wonderful and loving King.
The catch is that she will have to become a butterfly as well; her journey will take her through a terrible forest that is very scary having to watch and observe all that the butterflies and their babies will have to go through. They will have to face challenges with keeping their babies protected by learning to trust in their King as well as each other. They will learn the Kings way to turn their intentions into action, challenges into strength and their experiences into wisdom.
Based on the premise that by trusting in our King. He can change our lives and we can live an adventurous and exciting life for Him and our loved ones. Dancing with Butterflies is a story that will open up your emotions and your heart. 
I find that Dancing with Butterflies is stunning in its beauty, simplicity and scope. It distills the teaching and wisdom of our King, reminding us of how wonderful it feels to be awake, alive and to love one another.
