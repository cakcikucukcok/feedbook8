  <title>Missy Pays The Rent - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lisa loves the beginning of the month. It starts with her and her husband Keith collecting the rent from the tenants of the apartment building they risked everything they had to buy, and is now making them quite a bit of money.
This month however, Lisa is not completely happy. The Wilsons are down on their luck, and months behind on their rent. Lisa hates to have to ask them to leave, but business is business, and they have to talk to them.
Once there, Lisa feels worse when she has to look at their 19 year old niece Missy, whom the Wilson&#39;s are putting through college. Normally Lisa doesn&#39;t mind looking at Missy; she&#39;s an adorable doe-eyed brunette whose sweet innocence makes her fantasize about having her.
The next night Lisa&#39;s fantasies are about to become a hot reality when sweet little Missy shows up on their doorstep offering to do anything she can to help her aunt and uncle.
