  <title>Living a Bhakti Life - A.R. Pashayan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;em&gt;Living a Bhakti Life&lt;/em&gt;, author &lt;strong&gt;A. R. Pashayan&lt;/strong&gt; recounts experiencing a spiritual download in 2004 during meditation that literally changed her life. She was tormented with repetitive dreams of death, night after night, brought on in part by a death in the family, stress from work, and no alone time. She, along with a friend, tried analyzing the dreams. Nothing was clear until she took a month-long break in a place that looked like HeavenTelluride, Colorado, where she finally left her old self behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her dreams made sense now. Her spiritual download paved the way for a new level of understanding life, illness, stress, and practical spirituality. She started practicing Bhakti yoga and meditation, and she finally found calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhakti yoga is defined as a spiritual path described in Hindu philosophy used for fostering love, utter faith, and surrender to God. There is only one path to God: the path to grace, or Bhakti. Through yoga and quiet contemplation on top of the mountain, she soon discovered that it was possible to literally be unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Living a Bhakti Life&lt;/em&gt;, Pashayan opens a pathway to enlightenment and Gods love through Bhakti yoga through divine power and divine love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
