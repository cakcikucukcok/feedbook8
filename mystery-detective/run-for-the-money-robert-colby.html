&quot;Bob Colby was more than just a &#39;one-hit wonder.&#39; He wrote several other respected novels in the 1950s and &#39;60s, including The Deadly Desire and The Secret of the Second Door (both Gold Medal, 1959) and dozens of short stories for Alfred Hitchcock and Mike Shayne...

&lt;p&gt;
&quot;He had a journalist&#39;s eye for his times. This was especially true in the novels he set in Hollywood. [The Captain Must Die] is his masterpiece. You will not be disappointed.&quot; -- Ed Gorman" />
