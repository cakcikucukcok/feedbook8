saved her life she devoted the last 3 and a half years of her life to writing a book that would
make recovering patients laugh. She wanted to give something back to the hospital (KING GEORGES HOSPITAL) that saved her life. Almost all the poems in this book were written
while she was an inpatient at the KING GEORGES HOSPITAL in London England. Some will make you laugh and others will make you cry. I had many laughs and many cries on my many visits to the Hospital. Im sure you will enjoy this book." />
