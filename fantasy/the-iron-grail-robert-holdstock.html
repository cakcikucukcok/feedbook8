  <title>The Iron Grail - Robert Holdstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first is a man who needs you and will use you. He will weaken you dangerously. The second is a man you betrayed, though you believe otherwise. He wishes to kill you and can do so easily. The third is a ship that is more than a ship. She grieves and broods. She will carry you to your grave.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three warnings greet Merlin on his return to Alba, the future England, to the deserted fortress of Taurovinda---the Hill of the White Bull. He is not the only one making the journey: Urtha, High King of the Cornovidi, is coming home to reclaim his stronghold, and Jason is sailing in on the Argo to seek his younger son, hiding somewhere in the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Urtha&#39;s fortress has been taken by warriors from Ghostland; they claim it as their own. There will be war against the Otherworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sequel to &lt;i&gt;Celtika&lt;/i&gt;, Robert Holdstock weaves myth and history into a fabulous tale of honor, death, and magic. At its center, moving along his never-ending path, is Merlin himself, an enchanter in the prime of his life, reckless, curious, powerful, yet a stranger to his own past---a past that is catching up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
