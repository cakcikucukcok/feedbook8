  <title>Mom&#39;s Wet Dreams - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Derek&amp;#39;s a good son who will do anything for his lonely mother. So when his mother complains of having strange dreams and asks her son if he&amp;#39;d sleep in her bed to keep her company how could he say no? Over the next two nights Derek learns two things. One, his mother talks in her sleep. Second and more importantly? She&amp;#39;s not having nightmares, she&amp;#39;s having wet dreams...and they&amp;#39;re about him!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Huh?&amp;quot; Derek opened his eyes and wondered what woke him up. He was surprised to see it was only eleven. It had been ten thirty when he said good night to his mother so he must have fallen right to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He jumped when something hit his arm, and then rolled his eyes when he realized it was only his mother. In his half asleep state he&amp;#39;d forgotten she was next to him. At the moment right next to him as she moved again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Derek had his arms folded across his chest and mom&amp;#39;s back was now pressing against his shoulder. Her hair had somehow come out of the ponytail and was lying across his arm and chest. Mom mumbled something in her sleep and moved again, but this time it was just her ass that moved, pushing into the side of his thigh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hmm, that feels so nice, baby.&amp;quot; Derek&amp;#39;s eyes had closed, but flew open at not only her words, but the sexy purr they&amp;#39;d come out in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, yeah.&amp;quot; She whimpered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her ass moved up and down his thigh and he realized she was grinding her hips into his leg.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Faster.&amp;quot; She groaned. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s it, just like that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom,&amp;quot; he said softly while moving his arm and gently nudging her back with his elbow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot; Mom released moan that could have put a phone sex operator to shame and stunned Derek to the point that rather than wake her up he lay there stunned at what he was hearing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Fuck!&amp;quot; Mom cried out loud enough that he figured she would wake herself up. &amp;quot;Right there! Lick it , baby, lick it harder!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those words, along with the sexual noises that went along with them, snapped him out of his shocked state and this time he nudged her back and spoke louder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Shove another finger inside me!&amp;quot; Mom demanded in her sleep, her ass rubbing up and down faster on his leg. &amp;quot;Feel how tight I am? Just wait until you&amp;#39;re inside me!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jesus.&amp;quot; Derek whispered to himself as he lay there with his mother squirming into him and moaning like a damn porn star.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, God!&amp;quot; Mom whimpered. &amp;quot;Keep licking!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This time Derek slid away from her and turning on his side, grabbed her shoulder and gave her a shake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Mom lifted her head from the pillow, her eyes flying open. &amp;quot;Something wrong?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You sounded like you were having a...&amp;quot; Derek hesitated. Would she remember what she had been dreaming? He sure as hell couldn&amp;#39;t tell her she was having a wet dream.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I had a what?&amp;quot; Mom sounded groggy and her eyes had partially closed as her head returned to the pillow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A bad dream.&amp;quot; He took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh.&amp;quot; Mom nodded into the pillow. &amp;quot;It was bad. It was so bad.&amp;quot; She closed her eyes and sighed. &amp;quot;So wrong.&amp;quot;" />
