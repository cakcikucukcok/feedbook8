  <title>Fox Is Framed - Lachlan Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Lachlan Smith won great critical acclaim for his first novel in the Leo Maxwell series, &lt;I&gt;Bear Is Broken&lt;/I&gt;, a Shamus Award finalist and a &lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt; best book of the year that William Bernhardt called &amp;#147;one of the best debuts I&amp;#8217;ve read in years.&amp;#8221; The second Leo Maxwell mystery, &lt;I&gt;Lion Plays Rough&lt;/I&gt;, continued the story, and now, in the utterly suspenseful &lt;I&gt;Fox Is Framed&lt;/I&gt;, Smith confronts anew the drama that has haunted Leo&amp;#151;and his recently brain-damaged elder brother, Teddy&amp;#151;since childhood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Faced with evidence of stunning prosecutorial misconduct, a San Francisco judge has ordered a new trial for the Maxwell brothers&amp;#8217; father, Lawrence, who was convicted of killing their mother twenty-one years before. A prison snitch soon turns up dead, with Lawrence the only suspect, and Leo teams up with hotshot attorney Nina Schuyler to defend Lawrence against murder charges both old and new. Working the streets while Nina handles the action in the courtroom, Leo is forced to confront the darkness at the center of his life as he follows a trail of corruption and danger that leads to the very steps of City Hall. A tense, twist-filled courtroom procedural, &lt;I&gt;Fox Is Framed&lt;/I&gt; barrels toward an unexpected conclusion, as Leo struggles to do right both by the law and his blood.&lt;/div&gt;" />
