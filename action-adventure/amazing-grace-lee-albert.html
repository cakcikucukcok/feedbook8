  <title>Amazing Grace - Lee Albert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;He was chosen meekly to die an
inner death but had one gift hidden in his meek voice, the gift of editing to
starkness the quest that had entombed his captured soul. Now the world can hear
this childs plea as he brings to life the Holy Grail Quest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Born into a culture of sexual
ignorance and denial, he is unable to realize his deepest dreams due to
inexplicable fears and a deep sense of shame. His life however is held together
by a sense of the divine experience, born from a love of singing. He is driven
to succeed and travels through 36 countries over 21 years. Eventually realizing
he is a captive prisoner he turns for help to a little know African plant. He
then watches in horror as his soul releases itself and begins a journey of
reclamation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;We see through the authors naked
self the underlying factors which give rise to modern &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Ireland&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
as he struggles and ultimately &lt;span class=GramE&gt;succeeds&lt;/span&gt; to free
himself from their chains - the Irish psyche and its history are laid bare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This, the first of three books,
paves the way for an eclectic look at spirituality in the modern world in the
context of African Spirituality, Western History and the banished Child within
and offers a powerfully effective old way adapted to the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
century to heal the hurt and pain that lies in all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
