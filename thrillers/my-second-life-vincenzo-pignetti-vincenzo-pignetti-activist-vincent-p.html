      <meta name="description" content="Book written by 12-year-old Vincenzo Pignetti from Italy: Where can they bring the depths of their mind? What happens when a strange curse strikes a normal 12-year-old boy? What of what we perceive is &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; and what is not is it just a nightmare or is it reality? What if things are so expensive and not so different? If in the end one finds nothing but the same, frightening, what? If reality is a nightmare and reality is a nightmare? The author in this journey poses and asks us all the questions, desperately looking for the answer. That story of a normal boy, told by himself in the first person, turns into an agonizing and tormented journey that transports him to a dark and fantastic world populated by the strangest creatures. The protagonist will face trials, pilgrimages, difficulties, research, friends and in an undefined metaphysical grand piano. His will also be an introspective journey in search of his own identity, his uniqueness, his place in the universe. He will fight against the most varied spells and the strangest dark sorceries in a lively direct journey into his emotions and his reactions to the impossible and the unknown. Fantasy can fly in this monstrous world where the reader will then have to draw . Is it the second life that will prevail or will my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; life have the upper hand? They will fight each other, they will quiver, they will cry to be released in a continuous coming and going between dream and reality. But where one ends and the other begins, we will not know for sure. Instagram: @vincenzopignetti_real" />
