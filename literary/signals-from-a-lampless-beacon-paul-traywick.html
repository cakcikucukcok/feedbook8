  <title>Signals from a Lampless Beacon - Paul Traywick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;A review of that novel, Beasts of Burden, begins: Subtle moral conundrums stir this luminous saga of genteel Southern society in the mid-20th century, and ends: An engrossing social tapestry, filled with quiet spiritual dramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saga, which chronicles, primarily, three families, two races, and four generations, was brought forward in the second novel, Their Burdens Lifted, published in 2010. It is completed, with all narrative, moral, and philosophical strands brought together, in the present book, A Great City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traywick has stated that he intends to publish no further novel. Whether this marks the end of his effort as a writer remains to be seen. He will certainly pursue his preferred pastimes: Carpentry, plumbing, electrical wiring, masonry, the study of Old English, and painting (pictures, not walls). Traywick lives with his wife of 45 years in the mountains of Western North Carolina in summer, in winter in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. They have four children and, at this time, six grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;" />
