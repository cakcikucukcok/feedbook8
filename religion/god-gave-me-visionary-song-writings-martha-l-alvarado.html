  <title>God Gave Me Visionary Song Writings - Martha L. Alvarado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GOD Gave Me Visionary Song Writings is a unique book of true life stories, and powerful songs. The stories consist of every day living, and the songs are anointed lyrics conceived through dreams, personal experiences, and with scriptures from the King James Version.  Martha would often sing and share the words of the songs with her oldest sister;  until one morning, her sister said, &quot;get those songs, and words published.&quot; It was then, Martha prayed about it as she waited for Gods timing.  Then,In 2002,the spirit of God spoke to her again, and said,Youre pregnant with child,Martha replied, &quot;how can that be?&quot; The voice of God said, when you birth Joshua (salvation), you will sing.&quot; It was then Martha began writing God Gave Me Visionary Song Writings, to share what God Gave Me; even when you are faced with limitations, and also fill yourselves within with the words of God and know that you are victorious in him.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;A Spirit to Love&quot; was the first song that God gave Martha in a dream. This song reach beyond friends to enemies and persecutors.  Matthew 5:44.
         &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&quot;Hold On&quot; was given in a dream also. Martha dream that she stretched herself out on the earth and held on to the foundation of the word of God; while,interceding for souls (pulling them out of the pit).
 Remember to hold on until the blessing come, like &quot;Jacob, he held on until the next day. Ge.22:24.&quot;
