  <title>In Good Hands - Bonne Parish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;Carrie Anne Mossier is content.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passionate and skilled chef, her love of cooking and making people happy merge beautifully in her successful En Bonne Catering company. Shes grateful for the chance to lose herself within her cooking, as she is privately nursing both a broken heart and the resultant wounded pride, thanks to an experiment in love that went horribly, painfully wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She once thought she had found the man of her dreams in real-estate mogul Darius Steele, a man who was known for getting what he wants. Back then, he made no secret of his intentions with Carrie. Soon, the beautiful and sexy lovers were off on a romantic adventure overseas. After months of traveling, the unthinkable happened, and Carrie Anne was abandoned in a foreign country at a time of great need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hard lesson, but one she needed to learn. Now living a quiet life in Northern California, shes finding her rhythms and strength once again. When she sees Darius across the room at one of her catering events, every wound in her soul is instantly reopenedbut so is the irresistible attraction she once felt for him. She has changed, but he is back to his old tricks. He will stop at nothing to get her back in his arms again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen when passion and danger force her to place her love and trust back in his capable hands again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
