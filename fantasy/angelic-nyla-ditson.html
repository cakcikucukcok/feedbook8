  <title>Angelic - Nyla Ditson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;What happens when neither heaven nor hell will let you in?&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the crunch of metal and the squeal of tires, twenty year old Celeste Evans is left heartbroken and weighed down with her fathers death. Devastated, she takes her own life, choosing to believe that death is what she deserves, the only answer to her torment. But when she awakes, she is neither in heaven nor hell but a hallway in between life and death. To Celestes horror, neither heaven nor hells door will open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a booming voice declares He is not finished with her yet, everything fades and Celeste awakes to find herself sprawled on her apartment floor. This phenomenon is so intriguing that she cant help but want to stick around to see what it all means. Questions after questions are added to her growing pile: Is that beautiful creature, Sebastian, who followed her back to earth an angel? Or what about Kalan, the one with the inky black eyes, could he really be a demon? Only time will tell but Celeste wants answers and she wants them fast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Wouldnt you?&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
