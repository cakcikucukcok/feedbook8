  <title>Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People - Amarillo Slim Preston, Greg Dinkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amarillo Slim Preston has won $300,000 from Willie Neslon playing dominoes and $2 million from Larry Flynt playing poker. He has shuffled, dealt, and bluffed with some of twentieth-century&amp;#39;s most famous figures. He beat Minnesota Fats at pool with a broom, Bobby Riggs at table tennis with a skillet, and Evel Knievel at golf with a carpenter&amp;#39;s hammer. Amarillo Slim has gambled with &amp;#39;em all, and left most of them wishing they hadn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memoirs of a living American icon, Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People is the story of life as a Texas road gambler and the discovery of the Wild West. It&amp;#39;s also the story of how Slim won the World Series of Poker at Binion&amp;#39;s Horseshoe, became a worldwide celebrity, and brought poker from smoky backrooms to mainstream America. Just let him tell it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;If there&amp;#39;s anything I&amp;#39;ll argue about, I&amp;#39;ll either bet on it or shut up. And since it&amp;#39;s not very becoming for a cowboy to be arguing, I&amp;#39;ve made a few wagers in my day. But in my humble opinion, I&amp;#39;m no ordinary hustler. You see, neighbor, I never go looking for a sucker. I look for a champion and make a sucker out of him ...&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m fixing to tell you a few things that I&amp;#39;ve been keeping to myself for a lot of years. If you&amp;#39;re not careful, you just might learn how to get rich without ever having a job.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;" />
