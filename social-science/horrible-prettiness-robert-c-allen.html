  <title>Horrible Prettiness - Robert C. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;!--not yet proofed--&gt;Robert Allen&#39;s compelling book examines burlesque not only as popular entertainment but also as a complex and transforming cultural phenomenon. When Lydia Thompson and her controversial female troupe of &quot;British Blondes&quot; brought modern burlesque to the United States in 1868, the result was electric. Their impertinent humor, streetwise manner, and provocative parodies of masculinity brought them enormous popular success--and the condemnation of critics, cultural commentators, and even women&#39;s rights campaigners.&lt;br/&gt;Burlesque was a cultural threat, Allen argues, because it inverted the &quot;normal&quot; world of middle-class social relations and transgressed norms of &quot;proper&quot; feminine behavior and appearance. Initially playing to respectable middle-class audiences, burlesque was quickly relegated to the shadow-world of working-class male leisure. In this process the burlesque performer &quot;lost&quot; her voice, as burlesque increasingly revolved around the display of her body.&lt;br/&gt;Locating burlesque within the context of both the social transformation of American theater and its patterns of gender representation, Allen concludes that burlesque represents a fascinating example of the potential transgressiveness of popular entertainment forms, as well as the strategies by which they have been contained and their threats defused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
