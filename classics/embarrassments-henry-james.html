&lt;br /&gt;
Henry James (1843-1916), was an American-born author and literary critic of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is primarily known for novels, novellas and short stories based on themes of consciousness and morality. He significantly contributed to the criticism of fiction, particularly in his insistence that writers be allowed the greatest freedom possible in presenting their view of the world. His imaginative use of point of view, interior monologue and possibly unreliable narrators in his own novels and tales brought a new depth and interest to narrative fiction. He is one of the major figures of trans-Atlantic literature." />
