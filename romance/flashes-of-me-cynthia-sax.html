He watches employees constantly, using his network of cameras, and enforces his rules by any means possible.

She sees the loneliness in his dark eyes, feels the gentleness in his marred fingers, tastes the need in his kisses &amp;#8230; and she knows he watches her. His silly rules about not stripping for the cameras and no sex at the office are destined to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kat likes to be watched. Henley can&#39;t look away.
