  <title>Live for Eternity - Johnathan Phillips Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Passions Have No Pity&quot;, from &lt;I&gt;Live For Eternity&lt;/I&gt;. &lt;P&gt;
The Man. Paris Stone. A fearless, seductive, passionate musical genius who vows to create a new music, win eternal glory and redefine what it means to be American, at any cost. &lt;P&gt;
The Woman. Simone Duplaix. A proud, dashing, brilliant heiress of a 300-year-old secret tradition of American women, who vows to stop him because she loves him. Live For Eternity tells the epic human story of these two irresistible forces as they strive to outdo each other in love, passion, ambition and brilliance. &lt;P&gt;
Paris Stone is the founder and leader of the revolutionary musical octet Orpheus. For ten years they&#39;ve worked to create a new music and now they are ready to seduce and conquer the world with this new sound. &lt;P&gt;
But months before Orpheus begins, Paris meets Simone, a moment that alters their destinies and everyone around them. When she hears about Orpheus&#39; mission, Simone bets Paris she can stop his and Orpheus&#39; inevitable success. Paris accepts her challenge and sets in motion events that might destroy them both. &lt;P&gt;
In their relentless quest to outdo each other, they trample upon accepted truths, uproot popular beliefs, and push themselves and everyone around them to the limit and beyond, all for passion, love, honor and victory. &lt;P&gt;
But how far will they go? How hard will they push? Sworn to eternal love but also sworn to outshine each other, will they risk everything they hold dear: their families, their love for each other, even their lives, all for victory and glory, all to Live For Eternity? &lt;P&gt;" />
