  <title>Norumbega Park - Anthony Giardina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richie Palumbo, the most prosaic of men, gets lost one night in 1969 while driving home with his family. He finds himself in the town of Norumbega--hidden, remote, and gorgeous, at the far edges of Boston&#39;s western suburbs. He sees a venerable old house and, without quite knowing why, decides he must have it. The repercussions of Richie&#39;s wild dream to own a house in this town lead to a forty-year odyssey for his family. For his son, Jack, Norumbega becomes a sexual playground--until he meets one ungraspable girl and begins a lifelong pursuit of her. Joannie, Richie&#39;s daughter, finds that the challenges of living in Norumbega encourage her to pursue the contemplative life. For Stella, Richie&#39;s wife, life in Norumbega leads to surprising growth as both a sexual and a spiritual being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Norumbega Park&lt;/i&gt;--by Anthony Giardina, the critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;White Guys&lt;/i&gt;--is about class and parental dreams, sex and spirituality, the way visions conflict with stubborn reality, and a family&#39;s ability to open up for others a world they can never fully grasp for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
