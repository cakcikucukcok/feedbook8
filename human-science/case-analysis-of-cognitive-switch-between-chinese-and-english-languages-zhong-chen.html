  <title>Case Analysis of Cognitive Switch Between Chinese and English Languages - Zhong Chen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Chinese language contains a set of mind-sets that differ from those in English. Such differences between languages require mind-set conversion in cross-cultural communication. In applying cognitive linguistic theories to examining cross-cultural communication cases, this book explores cognitive mind-sets in English and Chinese as well as the processes of converting them from one language to another. It focuses on the principles by which a language selects its cognitive perspective based on its cultural convention, perception, and the conventional ways of representation of the world. 
In analyzing the linguistic rules and culturally driven cognitive motivation through an issue-driven and case study approach, this book helps students and other readers understand better the cross-cultural cognitive motivation between English and Chinese. In so doing, this book aims at enhancing the interest level and study efficacy for foreign language learning. This book can serve as a reference for instructors in syllabus designing as well as for linguistic professional training. The book is also suitable to be used as a reference for undergraduate and postgraduate students majoring in linguistics, translation, and teaching Chinese as foreign language to speakers of other languages. Finally, it can be a useful reference for undergraduates who learn Chinese as a foreign language." />
