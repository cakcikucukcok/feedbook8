  <title>Adopting a Toddler - Denise Harris Hoppenhauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally, a childcare book written with the unique needs of adopted toddlers in mind. Written by an adoptive parent, &lt;I&gt;Adopting A Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?&lt;/I&gt; is an indispensable guide to the wonderful world of toddler adoption. Filled with essential parenting information, &lt;I&gt;Adopting a Toddler&lt;/I&gt; answers many questions that parents ask, including questions about changing a name, choosing a crib versus a bed, beginning potty training, and what size shoes to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Adopting a Toddler&lt;/I&gt; is easy to read and covers every aspect of adopting a one to four year-old; with sections on the toddler wardrobe, the nursery, child safety, mealtime, bath time, selecting a pediatrician, medical considerations, international adoption travel, pre and post adoption resources, and more. &lt;I&gt;Adopting a Toddler&lt;/I&gt; provides the most up-to-date solutions for preparing for your new arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;If you&#39;re a first time parent, believe me-this is the practical &#39;how to, how much, when, where and why&#39; guide to preparing for and welcoming your toddler home. Highly recommended!&quot;-Roberta Rosenberg, &lt;I&gt;AdoptShoppeBooks.com&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;&lt;I&gt;Adopting a Toddler&lt;/I&gt; fulfills an unclaimed niche within the realm of older child adoption literature. Ms. Hoppenhauer combines research with her personal experiences as an adoptive parent. Parents will refer to it multiple times.&quot;-Susan M. Ward
Editor, &lt;I&gt;Older Child Adoption Online Magazine&lt;/I&gt;, www.olderchildadoption.com&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Written with a mom&#39;s humor, this book contains the most practical advice on adopting a toddler I have ever read.&quot;-John Maclean, Author, &lt;I&gt;Russian Adoption Handbook, Chinese Adoption Handbook&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
