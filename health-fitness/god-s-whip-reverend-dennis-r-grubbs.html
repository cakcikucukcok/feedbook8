  <title>God’S Whip - Reverend Dennis R. Grubbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From these pages, you will be imbued with ardent verity of the many parities within life. 
God allowed me to be burdened with many physical defects from birth, but He also gave me the strength, courage, and the desire, to never quit, in my attempts to overcome. 
I am in hope that you will glean, through the information herein spent, some being of my many birth defects, plus, a few of life&#39;s, natural and normal calamities, and, those magnificent things brought about as a result of my unwillingness to allow those birth defects, and like anomalies; to stop me, and keep me from beating the odds, thereby, allowing myself to become a: World Renowned, Organist. Yes, you read it correctly, World Renowned. Read on. 
Through the writing of this missive, I wish to convey to all hereto imbibing, HOPE, and, ENCOURAGEMENT; especially to any of those who may be in despair, who perchance, may read this brochure, and thereby, glean the understanding, that, even though they may have weakness of spirit, they still have the ability, by which, to, go forward, and SUCCEED, if they truly make an honest effort." />
