  <title>Light in the Dark - Donald Anyagwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is in our world incessant silent echoes of deception, spread storms of indifference, hidden slave masters that are hindrances to the hearts and minds of those on the roadway to salvation. The only way out of this humankinds disorientation; the one remaining consolation to the troubled souls of men and women, and the return of peace to the thirsting world, will be the light that comes from the word of God made flesh in Christ. It is thus a great gift a priest-homilist and preacher offers the people, as they assemble to commune with their God in the Eucharistic liturgy.
The Author
In this diligently written book: Light in the DarkSunday Homilies for Cycle A, Fr. Anyagwa used stories, live experiences, his pastoral encounters, and parallel biblical pericopes to enrich the homilies. Due to the books synthetic qualities, diversified contents and contexts, as well as the authors balanced theological and hermeneutical approach, I strongly recommend this book for both clergy and lay faithful. To priests, deacons, religious, catechists and pastoral assistants it would serve as a veritable resource for adapting a Sunday and Feast Day homilies; to the rest it would among others pre-dispose one to benefit enormously from a particular Sundays or Feast Days readings before and after theyre read and reflected upon by the homilist.
