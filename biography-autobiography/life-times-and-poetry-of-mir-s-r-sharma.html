  <title>Life,Times and Poetry of Mir - S R Sharma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mir-Taqi-Miror Mir, as he is better knownwas one of the greatest poets of Urdu. The book is a fascinating story of his life of rare courage and grit. Orphaned at the age of eleven with the death of an ascetic father, with nothing to fall back on, young Mir was thrown into difficult times to face life and support his family. The Indian subcontinent faced internecine wars, and the great Mughal empire was crumbling in front of the child Mir, who was left to fend for himself and provide for his family. 
Mir witnessed the destruction and savagery of Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali brought upon Delhi. These historical times left a deep impression on Mir as is seen in his poetic sensibilities. The book captures the personal travails of Mir, the drama of his time, and his soul- stirring poetry. Arguably the greatest of Urdu poets Ghalib made a rare unqualified exception when it came to Mir as he wrote: 
Rekhta ke tum hee ustaad nahin ho Ghalib, 
Kehte hain agle Zamane mein koi Mir bhi tha . . .
Ghalib, you are not the only master of Urdu poetry 
Heard people say there was one Mir in the bygone era" />
