  <title>For a Good Time Call... - Donald Ph.D. Ladew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Fennimore is bored and depressed. He is a short man trapped in a tall world. While at a bus stop, waiting for his ride, he notices a perfectly written, copperplate script ad on the wall of the bus stop. It is surrounded by illiterate graffiti and stupid advertisements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a whim, he calls the number, makes an appointment and meets a beautiful girl who is taller, but then not. Miss Annie Brown, in a peculiar accent, says she works for a company called &amp;quot;For a Good Time Call&amp;quot;. Instead of enjoying her bed, he is transported to their offices 9 million miles beyond Pluto and discovers that they are a Galactic Employment Agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agency finds people of different races who can bring new view points to problems that have resisted all attempts to solve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While waiting for assignment, William spends time with Miss Annie Brown. They fall in love. He receives his assignment and they are sent down to a planet that has been at war for 11 years. She is sent to one of the opposing sides  by &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; and William to the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can only think of finding her. His many adventures crossing a vast, island-filled ocean to the other continent slowly bring him to the point where his 5 and 3/4&amp;quot; height is unimportant, and he does realize that he is having a good time. And so he should, &amp;quot;For a Good Time Call&amp;quot; guaranteed it contractually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William does finally solve the problem of the war and find his Miss Annie Brown." />
