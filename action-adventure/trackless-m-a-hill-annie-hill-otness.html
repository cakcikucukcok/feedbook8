  <title>Trackless - M.A. Hill, Annie Hill Otness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Trackless tells of the power of dreams and destiny. Set in Australia between the 1950&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s this book evokes a poetic vision of the vast distances of the land and the dissolving polarities between the truth of reality and the mystery of illusion. Magic and myth interweave in this novel of betrayal and deceit. This is the story of Aidan Randell, who abandons his career as an architect in a quest for art and freedom. When he meets gifted musician, Gwenyth Chamberlain, the ramparts of the safe world she has constructed fracture into chaos. Is it fate, foretold by Runestones cast by the strange dancer, Dolfine, that drives their destiny? Random chance? Or the inevitable consequences of cause and effect &amp;ndash; of action and reaction? Is what we want what we need? A priceless antique violin, or just a wooden box with strings - a worthless fake? Profound love and devotion, or just lust, passion and need? From the mansions of the rich, to beach shacks and remote desert camps - from sailing super-yachts to driving 4WD on outback tracks - they journey into the wilderness of the soul and discover bedrock. Where is the Bindrune now?&amp;#39; Aidan asks. &amp;lsquo;Do you believe in such things? Surely not.&amp;#39; Gwenyth replies. &amp;lsquo;I neither believe or disbelieve. It&amp;#39;s not a matter of belief but of the laws of action and reaction. She gave you a thing with evil intent, therefore it contains that evil intent.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
