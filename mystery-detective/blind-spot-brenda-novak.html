She&#39;s safe, happier than she&#39;s ever been and expecting her first child. She&#39;s also planning to marry Amarok, her Alaska State Trooper love interest and the town&#39;s only police presence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before the wedding can take place, a psychopath from the much more recent past comes out of nowhere and kidnaps her in broad daylight. Instead of planning her wedding, Evelyn finds herself doing everything she can to survive, save her baby and devise some way to escape while Amarok races the clock to find her - before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
