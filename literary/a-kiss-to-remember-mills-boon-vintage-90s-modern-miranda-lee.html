          &lt;strong&gt;AFFAIRS TO REMEMBER &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A lingering kiss…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angie was determined to throw off her memories of Lance Sterling. It had been nine years since her brother&#39;s impossibly handsome friend had stolen her fifteen-year-old-heart with a kiss. It was time to move on, time to stop comparing every man she met with Lance, time to let a man love her. Maybe there would be someone eligible at her brother&#39;s party? But there was an unexpected guest… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lance arrived and announced that his marriage was over. Now the temptation for a certain twenty-four-year-old virgin to try to seduce him was impossible to resist!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AFFAIRS TO REMEMBER -&lt;em&gt; stories of love you&#39;ll treasure forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
