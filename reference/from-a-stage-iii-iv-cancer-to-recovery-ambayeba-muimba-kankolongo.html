  <title>From a Stage Iii-Iv Cancer to Recovery - Ambayeba Muimba-Kankolongo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four years ago, my health began deteriorating with a blood pressure reaching 200250. I became anemic, lost about 2023 kilograms within a short period, and developed severe abdominal pain followed by rectal bleeding. I was told I had a large rectal tumor that needed to be urgently removed. I was shocked and frightened. I traveled to Canada for a second opinion. After laboratory tests, it was a stage 34 colorectal cancer nearly obstructing my large bowel. I was subjected to an aggressive long cycle radiation and chemotherapy treatment followed by complex surgeries for years, after which I was declared cancer free. While in the hospital, particularly following the nine-hour surgery for tumor removal, I could not regain rapidly my vital signsmeaning, I was dead in medical terms. However, by the Lords grace, I opened my eyes. My spouse and I had several dreams pointing to a spirit of death rooming around me. As the scripture in Job 33:1418 says, For God does speak, now one way, now another in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds. He may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings. I surely knew that believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and having faith in the Heavenly Father will instantly turn my desperate situation into a joyful one. I committed my time to reading regularly the Bible, and my family, relatives, and friends all over the world prayed for my healing and recovery. As written in Psalms 130:1, Out of the depths, I cry to You, O Lord. Together, we pleaded unto him, and he lifted me from down the valleys to the tops of mountains. Continual prayers acted as a strong medication to cure the illness." />
