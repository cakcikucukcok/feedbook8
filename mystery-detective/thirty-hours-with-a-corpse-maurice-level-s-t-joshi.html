  <title>Thirty Hours with a Corpse - Maurice Level, S. T. Joshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Characterized by gratuitous acts of brutality and surprise endings, these tales of obsession and violence are the creations of a twentieth-century French writer whose works were staged by the legendary Th&amp;#233;&amp;#226;tre du Grand-Guignol of Paris. The precursors of modern thrillers and slasher films, these stories have been specially selected for this edition and introduced by horror specialist S. T. Joshi. &lt;BR&gt;Thirty-nine &lt;I&gt;conte cruel&lt;/I&gt; (&quot;cruel tales&quot;) include &quot;In the Light of the Red Lamp,&quot; in which a husband&#39;s photographs of his dead wife reveal a deeper tragedy; &quot;Fascination,&quot; the tale of a morbid passion that develops when the narrator, determined to stay at home, shoots his mistress for the sake of peace and quiet; and &quot;The Bastard,&quot; concerning a father&#39;s suspicions about his son&#39;s paternity. Other stories include &quot;The Taint,&quot; a view of infanticide as mercy-killing; &quot;The Test,&quot; in which an accused murderer is forced to reenact his crime; and &quot;A Maniac,&quot; recounting a thrill-seeker&#39;s ghoulish impulse to witness death-defying stunts gone wrong.&lt;BR&gt;" />
