  <title>Above the Drama - Nefertiti Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RaQuan and Basimah were never meant to be. He was a bad boy. She was a good girl from a good family. But what is it they say? The good girl always falls for the bad boy  even though the bad boy was dating one of the good girls friends. Despite all this, Basimah knew that she and RaQuan were meant to be together; she would have sworn an oath on it. So when he shows up outside her window one night, she knows the time has come.
RaQuan and Basimah get married and have five children. They live a happy life together, until the summer of 1995, when things get wild in their house. Their daughter, Symirah, is ready to start dating. Basimah can hardly believe it, but Symirah is going after someone a lot like RaQuansomeone the family might not approve ofbut how can Basimah be upset, when she did the same thing when she was Symirahs age?
Basimah and RaQuan must lean on the power of prayer to make it through the terrible teens. As a family, the children must band together with their parents and stay strong no matter what trouble comes. Regardless of ups or downs, they will struggle to remain above the drama and use love, faith, and strength to grow together as a family, proving that no matter how bad the boy may be, love conquers all." />
