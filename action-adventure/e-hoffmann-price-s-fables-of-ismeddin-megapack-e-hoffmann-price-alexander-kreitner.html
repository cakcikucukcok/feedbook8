  <title>E. Hoffmann Price?s Fables of Ismeddin MEGAPACK® - E. Hoffmann Price, Alexander Kreitner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edgar Hoffman Price (1898-1988) was a prolific pulp writer who got his start writing for Weird Tales and became a peripheral member of the Lovecraft Circle of weird fiction writers. This collection contains every story he published featuring a Kurdish holy man named Ismeddin. Price labels him as a &quot;darvish,&quot; an alternate spelling of the Sufi Muslim &quot;dervish,&quot; a man who chooses to become a beggar and an ascetic to become closer to God. The term &quot;whirling dervish&quot; comes from the spiraling dances the holy men use to place themselves in a trance state. Of course Price&#39;s darvish is half-crazed, a master swordsman, and particularly good at stirring up trouble. However, the stories he appears in are notable for their themes of religious truths, justice and wisdom, and explorations of the nature of reality. Included are &lt;P&gt; INTRODUCTION, by Alexander Kreitner&lt;BR&gt; THE DREAMER OF ATLANAAT&lt;BR&gt; THE INFIDEL&#39;S DAUGHTER&lt;BR&gt; THIRSTY BLADES&lt;BR&gt; THE SLAVE OF JUSTICE&lt;BR&gt; SHAYKH AHMAD AND THE PIOUS COMPANIONS&lt;BR&gt; ISMEDDIN AND THE HOLY CARPET&lt;BR&gt; THE FORGOTTEN OF ALLAH&lt;BR&gt; ONE ARABIAN NIGHT&lt;BR&gt; A JEST AND A VENGEANCE&lt;BR&gt; THE SULTAN&#39;S JEST&lt;BR&gt; THE STRANGER FROM KURDISTAN&lt;BR&gt; APRICOTS FROM ISPAHAN&lt;BR&gt; THE HAND OF WRATH&lt;BR&gt; THE RAJAH&#39;S GIFT&lt;BR&gt; SATAN&#39;S DAUGHTER&lt;BR&gt; WELL OF THE ANGELS&lt;BR&gt; THE GIRL FROM SAMARCAND&lt;BR&gt; EVERY MAN A KING&lt;BR&gt; LADY OF THE MOONLIGHT&lt;P&gt; If you enjoy this ebook, don&#39;t forget to search your favorite ebook store for &quot;Wildside Press Megapack&quot; to see more of the 300+ volumes in this series, covering adventure, historical fiction, mysteries, westerns, ghost stories, science fiction -- and much, much more!" />
