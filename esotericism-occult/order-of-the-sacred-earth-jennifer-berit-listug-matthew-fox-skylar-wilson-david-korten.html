  <title>Order of the Sacred Earth - Jennifer Berit Listug, Matthew Fox, Skylar Wilson, David Korten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Matthew Fox has a well-established readership with more than 40 published titles. Formerly a member of the Dominican Order within the Roman Catholic Church, he was famously expelled because of his challenging the doctrine of ‘original sin.’ His groundbreaking book, &lt;i&gt;Original Blessing&lt;/i&gt;, was formative in the development of the now popular movement that came to be known as Creation Spirituality.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creation Spirituality is strongly aligned with ecological and environmental movements of the late 20th century and embraces numerous spiritual traditions around the world, including Buddhism, Judaism, Sufism, and Native American spirituality.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The publication of &lt;i&gt;OSE&lt;/i&gt; will coincide with the creation of an actual non-religious Order within which its voluntary membership will take oaths to protect the earth and all its inhabitants. The new Order will be celebrated with events around the country and globe. &lt;i&gt;Order of the Sacred Earth&lt;/i&gt; will be the “bible” of this new movement.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;As the subtitle of the book shows: &lt;i&gt;An Intergenerational Vision of Love and Action&lt;/i&gt;, the book is aimed at an intergenerational readership. Fox’s two co-authors are twenty-something activists.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All three of the authors will be available for interviews and will be actively promoting the book and the Order.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;With President Trump’s anti-environmental actions and stances, &lt;i&gt;OSE&lt;/i&gt; is sure to hit an emotional chord with the majority of Americans looking for ways to counteract his influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
