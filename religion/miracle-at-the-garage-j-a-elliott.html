  <title>Miracle at the Garage - J. A. Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We were baptized in Jesus name, not anyone elses. Let us all resolve to be simply Christians, disciples of Jesus Christ. If unity among believers was so important to Jesus, how can we not make the effort to maintain the unity He made possible by His death on the cross?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miracle at the Garage tells a present-day tale of hope, wonder, amazement, grace, love, and faith. God is here with us today, in our struggles, in our pain, in our love, and in our fame. This memoir offers a look into the lives of a few individuals with two common bondstheir love for Christ and their connection through the Garage, a mens ministry. It describes the miracles that have transformed them into the loving, strong, God-fearing, and courageous men they have become through Gods love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each figure in Miracle at the Garage has his own unique story, including author Andrew Elliott, who overcame alcoholism through the power of Gods love; Anthony, the spiritual leader of the group who overcame a life of drugs to come back to God; and John, who is in a car accident with Anthonys wife and miraculously walks into the Garagewhere he finds forgiveness. All of the people who share their personal stories here are part of the Garage ministry that serves as the backdrop for this inspirational collection. Incredibly, some of the miracles actually occurred at the Garage itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal reflections shared here can renew your faith in the miracle of Gods love and remind you that there is also hope, grace, and wonder in that faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
