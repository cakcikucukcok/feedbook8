  <title>Hot Christmas Nights: Shameful Secret, Shotgun Wedding / His for Revenge / Mistletoe Not Required (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Sharon Kendrick, Caitlin Crews, Anne Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shameful Secret, Shotgun Wedding&lt;/strong&gt; by Sharon Kendrick&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When renowned international playboy Giancarlo Vellutini invites shop assistant Cassie Summers to join him for dinner, how can she refuse? After all, she is an ordinary girl and chances like this don&#39;t come around very often!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Throwing caution to the wind, unworldly Cassie is completely at Giancarlo&#39;s mercy before she knows it. She finds herself agreeing to be his mistress for Christmas…. But will an unexpected gift make this temporary festive arrangement last a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His for Revenge&lt;/strong&gt; by Caitlin Crews&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Walking down the aisle toward striking but cold CEO Chase Whitaker was never meant to be Zara Elliot&#39;s fate. But to safeguard the family business, she&#39;ll have to play along…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chase is only interested in one thing—his own dark game of revenge against Zara&#39;s father. The one thing he hadn&#39;t counted on? Zara&#39;s charm and natural beauty unsettling his rock-hard defences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But their wedding night proves to be a game changer, and they both realise they&#39;re in over their heads. Losing is never an option for Chase…but winning suddenly takes on a very different meaning!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistletoe not Required&lt;/strong&gt; by Anne Olive&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This Christmas Olivia Wishart is determined to throw off the shackles of her past and have fun. And nothing says fun like a glamorous Christmas party! So, wearing a brand-new red dress and some seriously high stilettos, nervously clutching a glass of champagne, she&#39;s finally ready to start living life to the max….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Olivia had thought that pre-party nerves would be the only thing to get her heart racing…until a view even more spectacular than the glow of Sydney Harbour catches her eye. The drop-dead-gorgeous man with the steely black eyes is everything Olivia has ever wanted—and this Christmas she&#39;s not going to wait meekly under the mistletoe!&lt;/p&gt;
