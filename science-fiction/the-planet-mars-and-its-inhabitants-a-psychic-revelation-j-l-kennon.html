  <title>The Planet Mars and Its Inhabitants, a Psychic Revelation - J. L. Kennon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Science Fiction Novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It appears that Jesus the Christed One of God visited the planets of our Solar system, the planet Mars being one of those visited and investigated. And, as a proof of this it was Jesus Christ who functioned as chairman or presidentat the great Peace Conference held in the vast coliseum on the first sphere of the Heavens of our Earth. That was in the year 1912, as fully reported in &amp;quot;World of Tomorrow,&amp;quot; page 98. It was at that conference He stated that Universal Peace must be speeded up, as there were other planets to be investigated: and that the Earth stood in the way and was becoming a menace to neighboring planets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One hemisphere of Mars showing the North Polar Cap and the main Canal System covering the planet. The many thousands of small lateral canals, radiating from the larger waterways, and which form an important part of the general plan, have been purposely omitted from the above to avoid confusion. The circular spots and dots are the principal reservoirs used for impounding water for use during the long Martian summer. The dark areas shown in the drawing are Mars ancient sea bottoms now covered with vegetation. It will be observed that most of the canals are double, paralleling each other at a distance of about seventy-five miles. Centers of population are not shown for the reason that space is not available on so small a drawing. The City of Urid is situated adjacent to the reservoir in the center of drawing, just north of the equator." />
