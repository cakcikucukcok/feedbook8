  <title>Designing and Making Hats and Headpieces - Judy Bentinck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Designing and Making Hats and Headpieces is an inspiring instructional guide to the art of millinery. It explains how to go about designing a hat, what equipment and materials you will need, and the techniques required to get started. It divides the projects into three types of hat - blocked, headpieces and fascinators, and cut and sewn - and thereby describes how to make fourteen different designs. It goes on to suggest ways of finishing the hats with embellishments such as bows, felt, veiling and flowers. Drawing on her rich experience, the author generously shares her ideas and her advice so that you can achieve a professional finish and make a design that flatters the wearer and completes an outfit. With beautiful photographs and clear instructions, this book is an essential guide for anyone who wants to design and make a hat for a daily outing, a special occasion or a costume. The comprehensive coverage introduces stitching, shaping and sewing techniques - the essential skills of millinery; advises on design, where to find inspiration and fitting hats; covers blocked hats - five styles explained with different materials and trimming ideas; includes headpieces and fascinators - seven designs, including a bridal suggestion with lace, feathers and flowers; and cut and sewn hats - making the beret and bandeau using dressmaking techniques. With further ideas for trimmings, including advice on how to use bows, additional felt, veiling, flowers and much more, this is an inspirational book aimed at everyone interested in hats, millinery and fashion. Over 400 stunning colour photographs support the step-by-step instructions and illustrate the beauty of these hats." />
