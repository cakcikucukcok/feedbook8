  <title>Flame in Motion - Denise E. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love burns like a blazing fire, like a mighty flame. Love never fails, and that is who we are as flames in motion. We are Gods love in motion. Even though waters may come and try to quench our love and Gods light in us, know Gods promise that rivers cannot wash it away (Song of Songs 8:7). Denise Stewart, in &lt;em&gt;Flame in Motion&lt;/em&gt;, shares her own heartfelt story of challenges, perseverance, and clinging to Gods love and the light of His saving grace through His Son, Jesus Christ. Denise openly expresses her love for God and encourages the reader to know that Gods love is everlasting. God is faithful. Abiding in His love is living, breathing, and resting in love we can count on because His love for us is enduring love. Gods love is not human love, even as we are reflections of His love to one another. We, despite our imperfections, are the hope of glory called to shine the light of Jesus Christ to the world. We achieve this through intimacy with our heavenly Father. Now is the time. God wants us. He loves us. Even as waters rise, no matter what is going on in our lives, they cannot quench His love because Gods love never fails.&lt;/p&gt;" />
