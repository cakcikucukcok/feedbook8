  <title>Stepbrother: Forbidden Fruit - Scarlet Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hannah&#39;s world has just come crashing down around her. She&#39;s split up with her fiancé—she desperately wants to start a family, he doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s over, and Hannah feels like her life is over, too.
Then she gets a mysterious text message from Joshua, her software-billionaire stepbrother. He&#39;s in town, but won&#39;t tell her why. And he has to see her—right now.
It soon transpires that Josh has forbidden feelings towards Hannah, and it doesn&#39;t take much for her to realize that she feel the same way about him. But even more taboo is the gift that he wants to give her—a gift that has the potential to change both of their lives forever…
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
He was lying next to me now, his head just inches away from mine, his breath hot against my neck.
I pushed myself up onto my elbows. “Ask me then. You know you can ask me anything.”
Josh smiled at me. “I know I can. So. You said before that the reason you split up with David was because you want to have kids, and he doesn’t. Right?”
“Right,” I confirmed.
“And you know that the reason I split up with Jennifer was the same. I wanted to have a family. But she didn’t.”
“I remember,” I replied. I thought I knew where he was going with this, but I wanted to be sure.
“So,” he continued. “Since you want a family, and since I want a family, and since…well…since now we’re together…why don’t we start one. Right here, right now.”
I had been half expecting him to say this, but I was still a little shocked. I felt myself blush, although my skin was already red and flushed.
“You want to…to impregnate me? Now? Really?”
Josh grabbed my wrist, his voice suddenly urgent.
“Think about it Hannah. You know it’s right. For both of us. I can feel it in my gut. Can’t you?”
I thought about it. He was right. Deep in my belly there was a tingle, like an itch I couldn’t scratch. I wanted a child. And I wanted my stepbrother to be the father.
“Yes,” I whispered, then more loudly, “yes! Give me your baby! I want you to.”
Josh leaned over and kissed me, a slow, sensual kiss that filled me with desire for him.
