  <title>Secret Father - James Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;From a &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt;&amp;ndash;bestselling author, a &amp;ldquo;gripping and beautifully written&amp;rdquo; novel of love and family set against the backdrop of Cold War Berlin (&lt;I&gt;Bookpage&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Berlin, 1961. Days before the Wall rises, three teenagers from an American school in West Germany travel to the Communist side of the divided city to join a May Day rally. One of them has brought along a flight bag belonging to his father, a US intelligence officer. Before long, the teens are in the custody of the secret East German police, the notorious Stasi. Unbeknownst to them, their parents have unfinished business, reaching back to World War II, which will pull the three friends into the vortex of an international incident.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Told through flashbacks by alternating narrators, &lt;I&gt;Secret Father&lt;/I&gt; is a novel of missed signals, cloaked motives, false postures, and panicked responses that tragically echo across borders and generations. Like the classic period thrillers of Graham Greene, James Carroll&amp;rsquo;s politically charged coming-of-age tale provides a &amp;ldquo;somber and evocative look at some of the most frightening times in one of the most frightening places in the Cold War&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt;). &amp;ldquo;Carroll writes with rich, lyrical ease,&amp;rdquo; raves &lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt;. &amp;ldquo;His characters are richly drawn, and the pieces of his impeccably paced story fit together with the cool precision of a Mercedes-Benz.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
