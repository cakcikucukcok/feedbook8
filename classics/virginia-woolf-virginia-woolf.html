  <title>Virginia Woolf - Virginia Woolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;Mrs Dalloway&amp;rdquo; is a modern novel focused on the characters characteristics and not on the plot. Virginia Woolf was concentrated on showing us the mental states her characters found themselves in.&lt;br /&gt;
The novel, which examines one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, an upper-class Londoner married to a member of Parliament, is essentially plotless; what action there is takes place mainly in the characters&amp;rsquo; consciousness. The novel addresses the nature of time in personal experience through two interwoven stories, that of Mrs. Dalloway, preparing for a party, and that of the mentally damaged war veteran Septimus Warren Smith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While never abandoning her omniscient third-person voice, Woolf enters the consciousness of seemingly unconnected characters and brings their feelings to the surface. The characters are connected, and the narrative shifts from one to another, by means of shared public experiences, such as an exhibition of skywriting." />
