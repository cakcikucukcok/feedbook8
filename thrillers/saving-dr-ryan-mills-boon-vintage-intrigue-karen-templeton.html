  <title>Saving Dr. Ryan (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Karen Templeton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Widowed and penniless, Maddie Kincaid was driving through the tiny town of Haven, Oklahoma, her two small children in tow, when her &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; child decided to make an appearance. She managed to find the only doctor within miles–Ryan Logan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The rugged, handsome M.D. assisted her delivery just fine. And then he made her an offer she couldn&#39;t refuse….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brooding loner–and incurable workaholic–Ryan had already seen one relationship go down the tubes, and he knew that home and hearth were not for him. No, his interest in–and offer to put up–the beautiful, courageous single mother was purely professional. He&#39;d delivered her baby, after all. But could she heal his broken heart?&lt;/p&gt;
