  <title>The Shepherd - Dan Bilodeau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Liam Sheehan successfully infiltrated and dismantled a sinister cult known as the Dominion of God. Now, the group has resurfaced and is more violent than ever. Following a series of terrorist attacks against religious targets across North America, Frank Drumlin, a soon-to-be-retired intelligence officer, and the newly recruited agent Jacob Hoffman are tasked with obtaining Liams services yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although initially reluctant to renew his affiliations with the group, Liam ultimately agrees to act as mole in exchange for cash to help him get out of a massive debt that could get him killed. At the direction of Agent Hoffman, Liam soon becomes embroiled in the groups recruiting and acts as a cross-border courier in order to learn of the groups inner workings and membership. His involvement brings him ever closer to the mysterious cult leader, Black Mamba, and he gradually becomes a trusted, well-respected member of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his efforts, however, the group is always one step ahead. When Liam unwillingly becomes involved in abduction and murder, those behind the scenes begin to question his loyalty and credibility. Meanwhile, Liams debt collectors are still on his tail. In the end, Liam must decide what matters more: saving his own life or saving the world from a cult hell-bent on destruction. Intent on bringing the group to its knees once and for all, Liams journey into the dark world of religious extremism ultimately leads him to a disturbing reality not even he could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
