  <title>The Palace of Impossible Dreams - Jennifer Fallon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eternity is a long time to be watching over your shoulder...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tide is turning, and the Immortals who have walked the world for eons are once again coming into their powers and stepping from obscure boltholes to take control once more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very mortal lady Arkady knows of their plans but holds out little hope of being able to stop them. Branded and sold into slavery, Arkady fears all she knows and loves is lost--her husband, Stellan, was probably dead by now, hanged by the Immortal Jaxyn for his own nefarious purposes; and Declan Hawkes, the King of Glaeba&#39;s Spymaster and her childhood friend -- perhaps the only other human she knew who might risk everything to save her -- doesn&#39;t even know she&#39;s in danger. She will turn to her new owner for help ... but learning the truth about him may cost them both their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Stellan?  Well, it turns out he isn&#39;t dead and Jaxyn&#39;s plans hit a snag when he realises that Stellan, the one man who can challenge him for the Glaeban throne, has sought asylum in neighbouring Caelum. Strangely enough, the Empress of the Five Realms (a Tide Lord in hiding no more), and the Tide Lords, Tryan and Elyssa, seem to be on Stellan&#39;s side ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plots within plots.  Magic tinges the very air and the Tide will bring mayhem and madness to both mortal and Immortal alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
