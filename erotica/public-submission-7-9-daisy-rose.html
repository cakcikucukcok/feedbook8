I inhaled the sight of his perfect body as he sat down in the chair that I had just vacated. The white button-up shirt left nothing to the imagination. Small perky nipples pushed against the fabric and his firm muscles and six-packs were obvious behind the thin material.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I tried not to pass out from the sight alone. It was unfair how hot he was.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So I should tell them more about myself?&amp;quot; I asked even though I already knew what the answer was. I just wanted to hear his voice.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He had a deep baritone voice that vibrated through my bones and awakened all the nerve endings in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. Show them who you are,&amp;quot; he said, sounding a million miles away, his eyes glued to the sweet heat between my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled my feet up and wrapped my arms around my knees, knowing that my pants were short and baggy enough for him to see exactly how naked I was underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;All semblance of thought left him immediately and he stopped talking.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Peter?&amp;quot; I inquired, trying to get his attention back. &amp;quot;You mean to show more of myself to them, then?&amp;quot; I licked my lips and felt a tingle in my core as his eyes followed the movement of my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he half-groaned, adjusting his position on the seat as if uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Show me,&amp;quot; I said, opening my legs wide and patting empty spot on the bed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He looked visibly uncomfortable, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His eyes lingered on the throbbing core barely hidden by my pants and his fingers were shaking slightly as he lowered my application paper between my legs, just a little above my pussy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I bit my lip. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think it can fit, Peter,&amp;quot; I said. I grinned inwardly while watching him struggle to maintain composure. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s already quite full,&amp;quot; I leaned forward as I spoke, giving him an eyeful of my breasts as I did so.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;A frown formed on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll be a tight fit, but I think I can manage...&amp;quot; he said, licking his lips.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;There was no mistaking what he was talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I- Peter-&amp;quot; he was leaning towards me at a speed that was both too quick and too slow. His breath was warm against my skin and his eyes were an intense blue that shone with desire.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Our lips were barely an inch apart. I parted my lips willingly, anticipating the sensation of his soft lips on mine. Except it never came.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, he pulled my wrists over my head and twisted me around in bed so that my face was pushed against the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been a bad girl, Anita.&amp;quot;" />
