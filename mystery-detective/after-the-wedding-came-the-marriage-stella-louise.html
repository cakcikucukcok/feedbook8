  <title>After the Wedding Came the Marriage - Stella Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This novel has a pronounced Christian theme but centers on notions, such as forgiveness, that are all-inclusive. Louise doesnt focus on the mystery of who shot Paul, but still has fun by teasing plot twists. At its best, an engaging story of surviving tragedy with a universal, moral message.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Kirkus Review&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of mistaken identity, Edmond was severely beaten, shot, and left for dead. They left him with a loss of memory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he worked on regaining his identity and learning who tried to kill him and why, he meets and helps Denise who is struggling in her endeavors to forgive her deceased husband for his infidelity, and her grandmother for her adulterous affair. When Denise learns of her husbands death, she also learns someone wanted to assassinate him. Two people who she loved dearly had betrayed her trust and it became difficult for her to trust again. The old adage, Time heals all wounds, did not apply to Denises life. Her wounds were not healing with time. There were times when she felt numb, paralyzed from a life of people whom she loved, but she felt that love in her life was a world filled with deception. While both Denise and Edmond worked through the challenges in their lives, they learned the truth about the attempt on Edmonds life. The attempted assassination of Denises husband changed their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
