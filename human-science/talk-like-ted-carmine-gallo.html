  <title>Talk Like TED - Carmine Gallo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ideas are the currency of the twenty-first century. In order to succeed, you need to be able to sell your ideas persuasively. This ability is the single greatest skill that will help you accomplish your dreams. Many people have a fear of public speaking or are insecure about their ability to give a successful presentation. Now public speaking coach and bestselling author Carmine Gallo explores what makes a great presentation by examining the widely acclaimed TED Talks, which have redefined the elements of a successful presentation and become the gold standard for public speaking. TED ? which stands for technology, entertainment, and design ? brings together the world&#39;s leading thinkers. These are the presentations that set the world on fire, and the techniques that top TED speakers use will make any presentation more dynamic, fire up any team, and give anyone the confidence to overcome their fear of public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book, Carmine Gallo has broken down hundreds of TED talks and interviewed the most popular TED presenters, as well as the top researchers in the fields of psychology, communications, and neuroscience to reveal the nine secrets of all successful TED presentations. Gallo&#39;s step-by-step method makes it possible for anyone to deliver a presentation that is engaging, persuasive, and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmine Gallo&#39;s top 10 &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller &lt;i&gt;Talk Like TED&lt;/i&gt; will give anyone who is insecure about their public speaking abilities the tools to communicate the ideas that matter most to them, the skill to win over hearts and minds, and the confidence to deliver the talk of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opinions expressed by Carmine Gallo in TALK LIKE TED are his own.
