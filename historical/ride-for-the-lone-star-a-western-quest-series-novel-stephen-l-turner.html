  <title>Ride for the Lone Star: A Western Quest Series Novel - Stephen L. Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aaron Turner is a tall redheaded fifty-three year old minister and Lieutenant Colonel in the Texas militia. Duty calls him to participate in both the Cherokee and Wichita Wars. He and his family struggle to survive the financial panic of 1837, Indian raids, a whooping cough epidemic and scorching drought. He responds with optimism, determination and innovation. When money is scarce, they gather and sell wild horses. When food is scarce, they travel to the dangerous Comancheria to hunt buffalo. As the Mexican-American War erupts, Aaron is commissioned Colonel of Scouts and leads a regiment that will play a significant role in the conflict in a faraway land. Will the time come when the old warrior will lay down his saber? Will he hang up his guns in peace at last? RIDE FOR THE LONE STAR, the fourth volume in the Western Quest Series, follows Aaron Turner, his family and friends, through the turbulent days of the Republic of Texas, culminating in the annexation of Texas by the United States and the Mexican-American War. STEPHEN L. TURNER was born a fifth generation Texan, sixth generation Arkansan, and eighth generation American. His youth was steeped in the history and culture of his heritage. A graduate of Texas Tech School of Medicine, he has worked as a pediatrician in rural Plainview, Texas since 1984. He is married with two married children. His other time is spent on their panhandle ranch, raising horses and hunting. His other novels in the Western Quest Series to date are OUT OF THE WILDERNESS, ON THE CAMINO REAL and UNDER TROUBLED SKIES, all from Sunstone Press." />
