  <title>The Last Apostle - Dennis Brooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if John, the last living apostle of Jesus Christ, was still alive and well… and living in Seattle?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A.D. 100, John is restored to the body of his youth and sent on a mission with a warning: to never reveal his true identity. He winds up on a small Greek isle where he faces an attempted assassination, a run-in with the Roman authorities, and develops a relationship with the daughter of the village leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to modern day Seattle, where John leads a foundation dedicated to bringing clean water to third world nations. A new television series brings attention to ancient legends about the true fate of John the apostle and threatens to reveal the truth of his identity. John struggles to keep his secret as he grows close to Nicole, a young woman he recruits to lead his organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two thousand years, John has wandered the earth while hiding his true identity. But now, both friends and foes are on the verge of discovering who he truly is—an event that will trigger the end times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can John divert those who would discover his secret, or will curious friends and suspicious enemies spark the apocalypse? &lt;i&gt;The Last Apostle&lt;/i&gt; is the first in the series of novels on the life of John over the last two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
