  <title>The wider benefits of investment in cultural heritage - Collectif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dozens of investments have been made in cultural monuments and historic  environments in the countries of South-East Europe over the last decade  in accordance with the principles of the European Union and Council of  Europe Ljubljana Process. Whether investing in cultural heritage  actually produces dividends for local economies and improves the quality  of life of communities has not been previously demonstrated, however.  This book reports on a pilot exercise carried out by the Research Unit  on South Eastern Europe at the European Institute of the London School  of Economics and Political Science. It develops a methodology for the  collection of evidence needed to monitor and evaluate the wider benefits  of investment in cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This book presents the  findings of a study on six completed projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Serbia. It identifies the challenges to achieving sustainable  development goals – and how they may be met – and the benefits, both  direct and indirect, that can arise from developing and valorising  cultural heritage sites and increasing their influence on the  sustainability of the local economy and on quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On  the basis of detailed case studies, the book provides an overview of the  main challenges facing  cultural heritage in South-East Europe from a  pan-European perspective and analyses the institutional and policy  framework for effective sustainable rehabilitation. It concludes with an  assessment of lessons learned from the study and makes some suggestions  for generating wider benefits from future investment in the cultural  heritage of South-East Europe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
