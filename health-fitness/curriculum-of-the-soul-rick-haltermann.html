  <title>Curriculum of the Soul - Rick Haltermann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an invitation to consider a new perspective on how to navigate your life. Regardless of age or background, there is a commonality to human experience, from the tools we are all given to help with life&amp;rsquo;s suffering, to the challenges we face. How can one be in the world while staying true to one&amp;rsquo;s higher self? What is the purpose of living a soul life? And can it prepare us for the inevitability of death?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 150 poems collected within these pages span many ages and cultures, having been selected for their capacity to affirm, to comfort, and perhaps even to advise us in the course of our day-to-day struggles. We live in a world that has been drifting away from the metaphorical as a way to describe and understand the mystery of being alive. Many people define their lives in terms of extremes, the need for survival, or the possibility of success rather than cultivating a love toward one&amp;rsquo;s self so that it can be extended outward to others and the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is no method or program here. What you will find is a general guide to discover your soul&amp;rsquo;s own curriculum. How will you know when you are there? When you are back in your loving. Take a deep breath, sit, read. It&amp;rsquo;s time to consider your soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
