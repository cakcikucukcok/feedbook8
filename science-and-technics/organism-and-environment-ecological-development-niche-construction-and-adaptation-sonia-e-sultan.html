  <title>Organism and Environment: Ecological Development, Niche Construction, and Adaptation - Sonia E. Sultan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past decade, advances in both molecular developmental biology and evolutionary ecology have made possible  a new understanding of organisms as dynamic systems interacting with their environments. This innovative book synthesizes a wealth of recent research findings to examine how environments influence phenotypic expression in individual organisms (ecological development or eco-devo), and how organisms in turn alter their environments (nicheconstruction).  A key argument explored throughout the book is that ecological interactions as well as natural selection are shaped by these dual organism-environment effects. This synthesis is particularly timely as biologists seek a unified contemporary framework in which to investigate the developmentaloutcomes, ecological success, and evolutionary prospects of organisms in rapidly changing environments.  Organism and Environment is an advanced text suitable for graduate level students taking seminar courses in ecology, evolution, and developmental biology, as well as academics and researchers in these fields." />
