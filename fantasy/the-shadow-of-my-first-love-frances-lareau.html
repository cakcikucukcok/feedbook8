  <title>The Shadow of My First Love - Frances Lareau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE SHADOW of my First Love
Love is a mystery and an emotion that I
cherish and enjoy each day.
It has been an exciting, interesting and volatile journey,
one that has given me the opportunity to feel the many
emotions that come from love.
Love began in the womb and has always carried me
throughout my life.
With the various types of love that I have learned
to understand and to cherish I was able to
embrace love in all its lessons.
In my earlier years, my first love left a lasting impression.
It was an experience that has lived with me throughout
the years, like a SHADOW." />
