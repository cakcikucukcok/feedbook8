  <title>Bomba the Jungle Boy - Roy Rockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Separated from his parents since childhood, Bomba lived far back in the jungles of the Amazon with a half-demented naturalist who told the lad nothing of his past. The jungle boy was a lover of birds, and hunted animals with a bow and arrow and his trusty machete. He had a primitive education in some things, and his daring adventures will be followed with breathless interest by thousands. „Bomba the Jungle Boy” is a series of American boy’s adventure books produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate under the pseudonym Roy Rockwood. There are 20 books in the series. The first ten are set in South America, where Bomba, who grew up in the jungle, tries to discover his origin. The second set of ten books shift the scene to Africa, where a slightly older Bomba has jungle adventures. A highly entertaining literature being written for young readers in post-dime-novel America." />
