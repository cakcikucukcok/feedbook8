  <title>Idolatry of Blood - Frédéric Zurcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The preponderance and influences of religions in our world need not be established. Religions are largely represented in two categories of fundamental beliefs regarding the deity: those who claim monotheism and polytheists. If there is a single common thread between all religions, it is that they are all founded on at least some elements of beliefs that defy logic. Those unexplainable beliefs are accepted as faith by their devotees. If this observation is correct, one has to reflect on a few basic questions. If intelligent supernatural forces created humans, they are also the creators of logic. This suggests that the religions of our world should not be short on logic, but a simple analysis of their beliefs appear to show otherwise. The same could be said of the monotheist God; why does he expect a persons faith to be founded on elements lacking sound logic? The author answers the question in a rather surprising way. The lack of logic is only due to human interference in the affairs of God. The divine system designed to regenerate love originally created in the human heart has been corrupted beyond recognition. This book is a search for Gods rational plan of action to help humans grow true love in their hearts." />
