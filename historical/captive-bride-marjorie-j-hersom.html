  <title>Captive Bride - Marjorie  J. Hersom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maria stood above the harbor aimlessly watching the activity on the water. Skiffs were moving back and forth preparing a merchant vessel, the Portsmouth, to sail the next day. Watching the crew and the native longshoremen lifting bale after bale of goods onto the skiff, Maria wondered. Why isn&amp;rsquo;t Joaquina here to meet me, when she asked me to come and see her off?&lt;br /&gt;
Something is not right!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This na&amp;iuml;ve fifteen-year-old girl, unaware of her beauty, had no idea her life, as she knew it, would never be the same. She could feel a warning sign within her the moment she saw one of the men she had met that morning coming toward her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maria del los Santos y Castro (generally written Maria&lt;br /&gt;
Dilessantos) at the age of seventeen married Nathaniel Savory on November 30, 1850. They had ten children. Maria became the matriarch of a very large family. Helen Jane, one of the Savory ten, birthed Alice Webb who became&lt;br /&gt;
the authors grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is Maria&amp;rsquo;s story. She is the &amp;ldquo;Captive Bride.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
