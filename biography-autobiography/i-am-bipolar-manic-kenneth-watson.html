  <title>I Am Bipolar Manic - Kenneth Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tell someone you suffer from bipolar disorder, and that person may assume a great deal. For instance, he may want to call you crazyinches away from your next psychological break or maybe even dangerous. These assumptions are thanks to media renditions of insane asylums and men in white coats. In the case of Mr. Kenneth Watson, none of these assumptions would be true, and yet he is bipolar manic.
&lt;i&gt;I Am Bipolar Manic&lt;/i&gt; is the true story of one mans psychological journey. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder very late in life, Watson spent many years as a successful businessman in England before relocating to the United States. Once in America, his success continued. It was quite a shock when his bipolar diagnosis came to light in Watsons seventies. Surprisingly, though, Watson considers his self-proclaimed brain malfunction to be a gift from God.
Watson never has nightmares. He has mind power over physical pain, and he often finds himself floating on emotional highs. He has certainly made mistakes in his life, but no human being is infallibleincluding those suffering from bipolar disorder. &lt;i&gt;I Am Bipolar Manic&lt;/i&gt; is a look into an aging psyche, still sharp as a tack, regardless of a so-called malfunction. Overcoming adversity is only the beginning of this inspiring tale." />
