  <title>Do No Evil - Les Alldredge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Good vs. Evil  all Christians know the ultimate outcome of this perpetual struggle, but what about on a less cosmic level? What about our personal conflicts  urban violence, domestic violence, the daily challenge of making choices that are love motivated and honor God instead of being evil and self serving? &lt;br&gt;
This book follows a young urban couple, Samuel and Penny, as they try to honor their love for each other and Christ while confronting the attacks of an evil world. They are confronted by violence, greed, mayhem, hatred, prejudice, and revenge during an unusual courtship. But theres much that is unusual in this relationship. &lt;br&gt;
Pennys West Virginia heritage is not what you might expect, and Samuel has much to consider before he commits to a life-long relationship with her. His nominal Christianity is no match for the forces that confront him. Theres much for him to learn, and discover.&lt;br&gt; 
But hes not the only one with a quandary; Penny has to be very careful just who it is she marries. Not everyone can bear up under the weight of the legacy she is heir to, a legacy that is centuries old, dating back to the first human presence in the West Virginia mountain country she calls home." />
