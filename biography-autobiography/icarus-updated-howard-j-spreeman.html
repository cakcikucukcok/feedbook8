  <title>Icarus Updated - Howard J. Spreeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have described how it has always been my dream to fly even as a young boy, and Charles A. Lindbergh was my hero for his flight over the Atlantic even when I was just 8 years old.  Many, many years later I would duplicate his daring flight, but mine was not so daring because I had four engines and thousands of gallons of gasoline as well as much improved navigation facilities.  Although there is always danger in flying, there is also much enjoyment and satisfaction as well, and this story has tried to point all the many aspects of my experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	My flying began as a crewmember in 1940 and continued until June 1960, when I retired.  I look back fondly of those days and the many close friends I have made over the years, and I will never forget that time in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	This is my story of pursuing my dream of flying for over 30 years and the escapades and incidents arising during that time.  I accumulated more than 9,000 hours in the air while living this dream and have qualified in more than 20 different types of aircraft, including single and multi engine land craft as well as multi engined seaplanes.  Naturally, any incidents occurred during this time and more than a few will remain in my memory until I die.  I hope my story will be more than entertaining, but also educational.  This tale will take you over much of the world during peace time as well as during World War II.

Hello Howie,
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &quot;ICARUS UPDATED.&quot; I became addicted from the first page. It is a book that I couldnt put down. In fact, my wife, Jody, said &quot;I never thought Id see the day when you would read a book during Monday Night Football!&quot;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howie, thank you sharing your life experience by writing a marvelous legacy!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emory Lee Crews&lt;p&gt;" />
