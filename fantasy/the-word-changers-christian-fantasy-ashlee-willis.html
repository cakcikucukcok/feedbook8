  <title>The Word Changers (Christian Fantasy) - Ashlee Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Her parents argue and fight almost every day. Not only is their marriage falling apart, but teenager Posy feels her life is falling apart with it. Amidst anger and tears, she retreats to the old library down the street. Posy selects one mysterious book in an undiscovered corner of the library and is magically drawn into another world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Posy finds herself in a kingdom ruled by a cruel and manipulative king and queen who have attempted to usurp the role that belongs only to the Author of their story. The princess flees, an uprising is breaking out in the kingdom, and the prince and other characters fight against their slavery to the Plot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Posy and the prince search for the fled princess, encountering hideous monsters, fierce battles, incredible danger, and strange creatures that Posy only ever dreamed. They must travel to mysterious places that expose the darkest part of the heart, their own raw fear, and past wounds that haunt them. Will they find truth and forgiveness as they plunge into the book? Will Posy and the prince save the story? Will Posy heal the heartache she knew in her own world?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A fantasy with elements of Christian allegory, The Word Changers will keep you turning the pages until the very end." />
