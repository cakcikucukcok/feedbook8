  <title>Falls the Shadow - William Lashner</title>

I am self-made, self-absorbed, self-serving, self-referential, even self-deprecating, in a charming sort of way. In short, I am all the selfs except selfless. Yet every so often, I run across a force of nature that shakes my sublime self-centeredness to its very roots. Something that tears through the landscape like a tornado, leaving nothing but ruin and reexamination in its wake. Something like Bob.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;     --Victor Carl&lt;p&gt;A beautiful young woman is dead, her husband convicted of the murder. In seeking a new trial for the husband, defense attorney Victor Carl must confront not only a determined prosecutor and a police detective who might have set up his client, but also a strange little busybody named Bob.&lt;p&gt;Bob has the aspiration, one could even say compulsion, to help those around him. And it usually works out well for all concerned, except when it ends in blood. But Victor doesn&amp;#8217;t know that . . . yet.&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Bob, Victor is suddenly dressing better, dating a stunning woman, and both his economic prospects and his teeth are gleaming.  It&amp;#8217;s all good, until Victor finds a troubling connection between Bob and the murdered wife.  Is Bob a kind of saint or is this obsessive Good Samaritan, in reality, a murderer?&lt;p&gt;Filled with the keen wit, deep poignancy, twisting suspense, and dark realism that has entranced readers, impressed reviewers, and made William Lashner&amp;#8217;s previous novels bestsellers, Falls the Shadow is a riveting novel sure to leave readers eager for more." />
