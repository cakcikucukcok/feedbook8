  <title>Finding Our Center - Heather M. Ensworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Integrating astrology, mythology and spirituality, this book is a reflection on the themes of the astrological ages across the past 13,000 years and is an exploration of what astrology has to tell us about the meaning of the changes happening globally and culturally in this time. We are currently on the cusp of the Age of Aquarius, at the end of a 26,000 year precessional cycle and, according to ancient prophecies, at the close of a world era. With the recent discovery of the planetoids Sedna and Eris, new forms of consciousness are entering our awareness. Through listening to the messages of the stars and planets, we find guidance for our lives in this intense time of change. We live in a sentient universe, which is calling us back into relationship with the cosmos and with the Earth. In remembering our source (the galactic center), reconnecting with the spirit in all of life and in becoming centered within ourselves, we gain meaning and wisdom for who we are and who we are becoming and find a path for the healing and evolution of ourselves and our Earth." />
