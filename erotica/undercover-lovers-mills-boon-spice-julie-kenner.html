  <title>Undercover Lovers (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Julie Kenner</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GET INTO BED WITH THE ENEMY…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s exactly what FBI agent Tori Lowell is afraid of. Especially after she learns that her first undercover assignment will involve going into a sex resort, posing as the wife of her longtime nemesis–and nightly fantasy–gorgeous Carter Sinclair. Which wouldn&#39;t be so bad, except that, years ago, she&#39;d almost made it into Carter&#39;s bed. And she&#39;s afraid that once she gets there, she won&#39;t be able to leave.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After years of undercover work, all Carter Sinclair wants is a little peace. But when his final assignment pairs him with Tori, he decides to go for one last fling, too! The sexy brunette has had him tied up in knots since they were both cadets. And now, given their new &quot;marital&quot; status, Carter can enjoy his &quot;husbandly&quot; rights until Tori&#39;s out of his system, once and for all. Little does he guess that this &quot;marriage&quot; was meant to last.…&lt;/p&gt;
