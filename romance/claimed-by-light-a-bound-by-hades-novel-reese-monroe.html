  <title>Claimed By Light (A Bound By Hades Novel) - Reese Monroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new adult title from Entangled&#39;s Embrace imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forgiveness softens even the hardest of hearts...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;College senior Slade Bennet is so close to his degree he can taste it...until his sister becomes tangled with a coven of demons and he must trade his soul to save her. But first he must kill the assigned target: a sexually charged beauty who ignites his protective instinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the devastating loss of her Companion, the last thing Halena Girard can stomach is the emotional connection to a Mate. She lives for only two things: vanquishing demons, and seeking Artifacts rumored to lead to Lucifer&#39;s downfall. That is, until she&#39;s attacked by a...frat boy? Worse, a newly-demonic frat boy wearing the mark of her Mate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halena would rather kill Slade than give him her heart. Unfortunately, the only way Slade can find his sister and Halena the Artifacts is to work together. As they face the darkest of evil, Slade&#39;s ability to crush Halena&#39;s carefully erected walls might prove to be the most lethal battle of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
