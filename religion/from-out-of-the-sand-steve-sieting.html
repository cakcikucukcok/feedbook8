  <title>From out of the Sand - Steve Sieting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having isolated myself from the Lord, I was spiritually drowning, tired and worn from life&amp;#39s pressures. I was finished. No longer willing to go through the motions, I was ready to turn my back, walk away from God, and never look back. And yet I said one last prayer, hoping to receive something to grab me up out of my despair. Alone, depressed, and silent in my chair, the Holy Spirit simply said, &amp;#34I hear your cry.&amp;#34 He rescued me from self-destruction, and placed my feet on solid ground. My journey back into His presence has been a long but rewarding trek. He revealed my heart, and I had to confess, repent, and return for more instruction because it was true and done with love. I am humbled that He took so much time with me. He is my great I Am! My chronicled inspirational and poetic journey back into His presence was my revelation, and I now know that I was not alone in my drowning. So many people feel unworthy, lost, pressured, or isolated, and want to be comforted by personally knowing that God hears their cry as well. God wants to free you from feeling unworthy. He wants to tell you exactly where you are in Him and lead you into a closer relationship with Him. This book encourages you to listen, obey, and be responsible to the Holy Spirit. You are not alone! &amp;#34I hear your cry&amp;#34 ushered me into His peace. It is more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;" />
