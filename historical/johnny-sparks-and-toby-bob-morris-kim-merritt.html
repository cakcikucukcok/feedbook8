  <title>Johnny Sparks and Toby - Bob Morris, Kim Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Johnny Sparks lives on a farm in America long ago before cell phones, cars, and even lights were invented. To keep himself entertained, Johnny loves to read books about faraway places. But one day when he sees a gigantic shadow fly overhead, Johnny runs to hide in the woods. As he peers out from the cover of the trees, Johnny can hardly believe his eyes when he sees a pelican as big as his home looking back at him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Johnny learns that Toby the pelican is there to take him to faraway places, he hops on Tobys back. Thanks to Toby, Johnny sees a sailing ship, a Native American village, a buffalo, a cowboy, a paddle boat on the Mississippi River, and giant sequoia trees in California. Even though they love their adventures, new friends Toby and Johnny also help others in need as Toby teaches the young boy the value of learning, hard work, and faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Sparks and Toby is a childrens tale of a gigantic pelican and a boy who pair together on an adventure to see faraway places, help those in need, and share an important message.&lt;/p&gt;" />
