  <title>Home Bible Study Commentaries from the Gospel of John - Larry D. Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John&#39;s Gospel was most likely written sometime between A.D. 85 and 95. His depiction of JESUS is the most theological of the four gospels. He presents to us, a JESUS WHO existed with GOD, and, as GOD, even before the creation of the universe.  John&#39;s unique style confront&#39;s us with an overwhelming necessity to believe on our LORD and SAVIOR. He shows JESUS as the focus of a spiritual struggle between the forces of light and darkness, love and hate, and most of all, life and death. The four Gospels are our primary source of information about JESUS. And while they do not provide us with a biography of HIS life, they do present us with a clear picture of HIS person,and HIS works. It is my hope that these commentaries will help develop a better understanding of this gospel account, and that the reader will be able to make a decision to give their life to CHRIST, and if they already have, hopefully it will help them grow in their Christian walk, so, they too, can win others to CHRIST." />
