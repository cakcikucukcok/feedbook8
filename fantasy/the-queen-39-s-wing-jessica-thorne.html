      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;Took my heart out of my chest, stomped on it and then put it back, while whispering, &quot;Keep reading&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip; This book was &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Awesome Alitza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, 5 stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#39;I was born to fight,&amp;rsquo; I used to say.

In order to secure her father&amp;rsquo;s new empire, Bel is forced to travel to a distant land to marry its recently widowed ruler, &lt;strong&gt;Conleith&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any other young woman the chance to become royalty would be a dream come true, but for Bel, the rigidity of court life is like a prison sentence. And while Conleith is an unexpectedly intriguing &amp;ndash; and attractive &amp;ndash; puzzle&amp;hellip; could she ever love him when it would mean turning her back on her feelings for Shae, her first love and last connection to home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a brutal assassination attempt nearly takes her life, and Bel learns that there&amp;rsquo;s more on the line than just her happiness. Is it the same faceless enemy who attacked her homeland and, with dangers around every corner, who in the palace can she trust?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A heart-stoppingly magical new novel that will keep you turning the pages.
