  <title>Chickasaw County Captive (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Cooper Justice, Book 2) - Paula Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When someone tries to kidnap his daughter, Jefferson County D.A. Sam Cooper sees red. He wants little Maddy protected, at any cost. Even if that cost includes working with a distractingly attractive detective, Kristen Tandy. He knows Kristen wants to solve the case…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;so why does she try so hard to stay distant from him and his little girl? Remaining professional is something he fully understands, but the emotional–and physical–scars Kristen tries to hide make Sam deeply interested in turning things personal. And the more protection Kristen offers his daughter, the more her closely guarded vulnerability draws him in. Before long, as the truth of her past is slowly revealed, Sam realizes just how desperate someone is for her to remain silent….&lt;/p&gt;
