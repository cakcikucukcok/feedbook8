  <title>Nine Lives - George M. Moser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Michael Merlino lives a charmed life with a successful career, beautiful wife, and beloved sonuntil his dear father passes away; then things turn strange. Michael cant seem to shake this weird feeling, but maybe he just misses his dad, his mentor. He ignores the feeling that something is wrong.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One day, he accidentally kills a stray cata sad but everyday sort of accident; he doesnt give it much thought. When another cat appears in Michaels life, however, it makes him wonder whether the stray cat really died, and whether cats actually do have nine lives, as the saying goes. But this isnt your normal stray kitty. This cat is out for revenge. Its spirit wants something from Michael, but what?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When a man has everything to lose, however, its much easier to make it happenespecially when that man is up against what appears to be a supernatural enemy. As Michael begins to face his own demons via a demon cat that wont die, his work begins to slide. His life at home gets more difficult, even with his wife there to support him. Then, there was that note his father left that told Michael to drive it. What did the note mean? Could it possibly have been a warning? The mystery must be solved, as the reincarnated cat keeps getting bigger and meaner, threatening not just Michaels life, but his soul in the bargain.&lt;/P&gt;" />
