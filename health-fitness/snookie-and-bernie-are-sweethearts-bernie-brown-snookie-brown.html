  <title>Snookie and Bernie Are Sweethearts - Bernie Brown, Snookie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A last-minute date led to a life-changing commitment for two college students. Snookie and Bernie share the journey of their life together and many of the lessons they have learned along the way. This is their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From their children)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make an incredible pair, yielding higher results in their life together than either could have produced alone.&lt;br /&gt;
Jenny Brown Bailey, the first born&lt;/p&gt;

Amanda Brown McLean, the baby&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From the book)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grew up during a time when marriage, family, and faith were three of the most sacred and important aspects of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have laughed and cried; we have remembered things that should never be forgotten. We have regained some of the lost twinkle as we look into each others eyes. We have fallen in love all over again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
