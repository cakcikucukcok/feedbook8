  <title>Black and Blue - Ian Rankin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bible John killed three women, and took three souvenirs. Johnny Bible killed to steal his namesake&#39;s glory. Oilman Allan Mitchelson died for his principles. And convict Lenny Spaven died just to prove a point. &quot;Bible John&quot; terrorized Glasgow in the sixties and seventies, murdering three women he met in a local ballroom--and he was never caught. Now a copycat is at work. Nicknamed &quot;Bible Johnny&quot; by the media, he is a new menace with violent ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible Johnny case would be perfect for Inspector John Rebus, but after a run-in with a crooked senior officer, he&#39;s been shunted aside to one of Edinburgh&#39;s toughest suburbs, where he investigates the murder of an off-duty oilman. His investigation takes him north to the oil rigs of Aberdeen, where he meets the Bible Johnny media circus head-on. Suddenly caught in the glare of the television cameras and in the middle of more than one investigation, Rebus must proceed with caution: One mistake could mean an unpleasant and not particularly speedy death, or, worse still, losing his job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with Ian Rankin&#39;s signature wit, style and intricacy,&lt;i&gt; Black and Blue&lt;/i&gt; is a novel of uncommon and unforgettable intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
