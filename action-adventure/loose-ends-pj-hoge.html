  <title>Loose Ends - Pj Hoge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ian Harrington had worked all his life in law enforcement, until a gunshot ruined his arm, rendering it almost useless. With the help of his family and friends, he was able to rebuild his life. Even though being an accountant was less exciting, it was much more stable. He was loved his new wife and the life they were building together. He was someone who felt family was the very important, so he welcomed the news that he and his wife were expecting their first child that fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring, his arm began giving him severe muscle spasms and his doctor thought he should go back to Boston to see the neurologist who had cared for him after the shooting. Hoping to get the arm all taken care of before the arrival of his child, he and his wife traveled to Boston for his medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian was a good, gentle and decent man, who always tried to live above reproach. He was not perfect and never claimed to be, but he tried to be honest and fair in all his dealings. He had left the police force with an excellent record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chance encounter at a street bazaar shakes the very foundation of everything that he believed about his past, his life and himself. He soon realizes that no matter how straight forward and simple actions seem when one does them; they can have far, unintended repercussions. Handling them in a fair and decent manner can be much more daunting than the original intention.&lt;/p&gt;" />
