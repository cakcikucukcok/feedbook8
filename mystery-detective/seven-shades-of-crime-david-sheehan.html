  <title>Seven Shades of Crime - David Sheehan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1% of the US population is behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a criminal defense lawyer, I help criminals stay out of jail. The stories outlined here are just that &amp;ndash; stories. These stories can happen to someone you know and love. Reality and fantasy are intertwined. The criminals get into trouble over sexual indiscretion, in mind- blowing circumstances, set within a story plot that is unbelievable, while it is in fact perfectly true. At the heart of them, these stories are a discourse on law in literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My intentions are to promote a debate on sexual topics that we encounter daily, where we are firmly committed to our point of view that defines our sexual morality. I am aware the sexual morality of an American is distinct from that of a European, which is different from one who lives in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the sexual moralities of those within America are widely divergent. My views are guided by the Persian poet Rumi who obliterated the concept of right and wrong in morality. I find myself lucky to live in a civil society that permits such discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every story in this book is true. Somewhere in the nation, someone is being prosecuted for a crime with a similar fact pattern. I have tried to offer a well-balanced argument for and against the conventional wisdom. I am certain you have your own point of view.&lt;/p&gt;" />
