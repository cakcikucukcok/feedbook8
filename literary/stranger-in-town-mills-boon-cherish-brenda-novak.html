            &lt;em&gt;The car accident was Hannah Price&#39;s fault–a few seconds of inattention that changed Gabe Holbrook&#39;s life forever, destroying everything he&#39;d been or ever wanted to be. &lt;/em&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;He was a man who&#39;d had it all. Intelligent, handsome, talented, rich, he&#39;d been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. Now he&#39;s come home to Dundee, the small town where he was raised, but he&#39;s a stranger to the people who once knew him. Folks think he&#39;s bitter and withdrawn; he knows he&#39;s just focused on recovering.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike Gabe, she sustained only minor injuries. But she&#39;s not sure she&#39;ll ever be able to forgive herself for making a mistake with such far-reaching consequences. Especially when Gabe becomes her older son&#39;s football coach, and she begins to fall in love with the man she nearly destroyed…&lt;/p&gt;
