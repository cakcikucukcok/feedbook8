  <title>Eighty Years Behind the Masts - Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The introduction was written 62 years ago. The Great Beyond is my age from 17 to 80. This book reveals what can be done. It answers the question, Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miller genealogy is traced to Adam and Eve. The Miller Code of Ethics, Curriculum Vitae, and a Broad Mentality are defined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous people travel. I have circled the earth seven times, traveled to Japan 40 times, to Pearl Harbor 25 times, and I have driven thousands of miles in Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Study the worlds cultures. Learn the motto God gave us, Faith, Hope, and Love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life is working and learning. Read and learn without working. Plan your life NOW. Thirty years in advance I planned a sabbatical every ten years. I had three planned concurrent careers: Academic Neurosurgery, United States Naval Reserve, and Founder of a Neurosciences Center with an academic interchange with 25 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seven days a week for 40 years in neurosurgery, I feared retirement. At age 70 I retired to the unknown. I elected a new life. In our 34-foot Sea Ray we traveled to all 36 yacht clubs in the Florida Council, from Destin, the Keys and to Jacksonville. There is much time on a boat. I memorized the Teachings on the Mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to Apollo Beach, Florida. I became busy and coined a new term, Retirement Career. (Career as  go at top speed) I authored seven books, am on the voluntary faculty of the medical school, deacon and teacher at church, and continued Permissive Orders for the Navy. Recently I became the first 80-year-old drilling reservist. We have a pool man and yard man. (Our lot is covered in rocks and palm trees.) My responsibility is to keep the boat dock mosquito free by filling the Mosquito Magnet with propane, service the jet boat, and keep the garage in order. Read on and learn what one can do. &lt;/p&gt;" />
