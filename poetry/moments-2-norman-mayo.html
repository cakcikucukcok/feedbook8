  <title>Moments 2 - Norman Mayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I could have done better
For my mother and my dad
But I thought they were content
With everything they had
I could have helped with prescriptions
Took them for a dinner or two
But I had my own family
Just had too much to do
I guess, now that I think of it
They were both ill for a while
But dad, he never complained
And mom, lay in bed with a smile
Two proud parents, I remember
That gave love throughout the years
Often bring us laughter
And sometimes, bring us tears
I know I could have done better
Don&#39;t let these words be history
Read this poem and think of me" />
