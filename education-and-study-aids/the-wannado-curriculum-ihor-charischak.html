  <title>The Wannado Curriculum - Ihor Charischak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The dynamic classroom is a place where the interaction between teacher and students produces engagement and learning. Success depends on what the teacher does, how it fits in with the needs of the students, and the quality and utilization of resources. In The Wannado Curriculum, author Ihor Charischak tells how he turned his vision of a dynamic Math 2.0 classroom into a reality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Part memoir, part teaching tool, The Wannado Curriculum offers insight into helping teachers establish a context for creating their own wannado curriculum, a project-based approach where the context makes the content interesting to students. Charischak:&lt;/p&gt; 
 Describes how growing up as an immigrant in America impacted his learning&lt;/br&gt;  
 Tells how he discovered the secret to working with unmotivated students&lt;/br&gt; 
 Explores the idea that alternative ways of teaching and learning are the keys to powerful, dynamic teaching and learning that motivates students&lt;/br&gt; 
 Discusses his experiences in a private, child-centered school, where he used computers to practice the teaching and learning he was excited about&lt;/br&gt; 
 Relays how the real-life game of craps inspired a reluctant student to ask questions about the mathematical intricacies of the game&lt;/br&gt; 
 Brings to life his experiences with computers in teaching math&lt;/br&gt; 
 Details his vision of the dynamic math classroom&lt;/br&gt; 
 Introduces Math 2.0, a powerful environment that uses mathematics software and collaborative Web 2.0 tools in a dynamic classroom setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wannado Curriculum presents glimpses of what twenty-first century math teaching and learning could look like if a student-driven and teacher-supported method was universally embraced.&lt;/p&gt;" />
