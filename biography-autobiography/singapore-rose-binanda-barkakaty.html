  <title>Singapore Rose - Binanda Barkakaty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is, basically, a life portrayal of a loving wife from the perspective of her adoring husband. Binanda and Katie had been married for four-and-a-half decades. That is, until 22 May 2014, when Katie had to submit her earthly life to the Lord and Creator in heaven. She spent only five days in hospitaldidnt suffer much, didnt shed tears, but submitted her life to the will of God. Her married life is a glowing example of Gods unconditional love and unmerited grace on our life. She was courageous in breaking the mould, passionate about family life, and passionate about caring for the needy and the vulnerable. Nursing was her career, and caring was written in every part of her being. Katie played a significant part in the life of her husband, not only in supporting him as a cotraveller on Earth, but also in making him the man as hes now.
Written in simple language in his candid way, this book describes the life of a woman who touched the life of many people whom she cared for and others who came into contact with her. Above all, her life was a gift from the Almighty Creator, and his love and grace shone through her life to many a people all over the globe. The book also deals with grief of separation, suffering, and bereavement of a few devoted Christian authors, as well as their response to the attack of grief.
The book will appeal to those who would like some inspiration about the enduring love and everlasting grace of Christ Jesus, who gave his life at the Golgotha Cross, for the entire humanity, making us righteous with God the Father. And we can be sure of our eternal salvation in Jesus if we put our trust in him." />
