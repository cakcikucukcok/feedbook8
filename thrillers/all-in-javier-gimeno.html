  <title>All In - Javier Gimeno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daniel is a smart, young man of humble origins, who has been beaten down by his tough childhood in the mining basins of northeastern Spain. Unexpectedly, he embarks on an unwitting journey of discovery and personal growth that will bring him up-close to the best and worst of humanity. His interactions with a cast of secondary characters will shape him, little by little, until he becomes a new man who takes control of his life and goes down an unexpected and morally questionable path.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;All In&lt;/i&gt; is a fantastic choral story, full of rich characters who follow their own personal descents to hell in a world of extremes where nothing is what it seems. Love, hatred, passion, anger, fear; all these feelings have a place in this story of revenge, which forces readers to continually rethink their positions about the moral dilemmas at every step.&lt;br/&gt;" />
