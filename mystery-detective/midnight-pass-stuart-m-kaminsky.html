  <title>Midnight Pass - Stuart M. Kaminsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; The third title in Edgar Award-winning author Stuart Kaminsky&#39;s Lew Fonesca mystery series, &lt;i&gt;Midnight Pass &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lew Fonesca is a guy just trying to get along.  When his wife died in a senseless auto wreck, he got up and left his old life--and when his car gave out in sunny Sarasota, Florida, he stayed. He takes small process-serving gigs and various odd jobs helping people out, and he tries, although maybe not as hard as he should, to fix the gaping hole in his heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for a man who just wants to ease through life without any complications, Lew has a pretty full plate. The shrink that Lew&#39;s been seeing for more than a year wants him to finally dump all the grief that he&#39;s carrying around so he can have more than a half-life. And Sally, the pretty single mom and social worker who has helped Lew in the past, wants to deepen their friendship.  On top of that, a local minister asks him to find a town council member who has gone missing just before a crucial vote that could ruin a struggling community, and a distraught father comes to Lew to track down his wife and two kids, who Lew suspects ran off with the man&#39;s best friend.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people start showing up dead, Lew knows he&#39;s in way over his head--and this time he may not be able make it all come out okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
