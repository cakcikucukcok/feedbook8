  <title>The Day of the Hidden Truth Poems - Cheryl Freier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a fitting rendition of of our simple day-to-day thoughts on inspiration and hope.  Yet, the book excels as a lasting memorial for my husband, Martin Freier, and as a fourth sequel to the historical, biographical series, which begins with the first book, The Grayling Hidden Truth Poems.  Originally written to express heartfelt interest in Martin&#39;s struggle for survival as a young man in Nazi Slovakia, the four books evolved into a mystical expression of fear, hope, and inspiration.  Even though this story is unmiquely Martin&#39;s story, the composite effect of all of the books enligtens us to think what if I were Martin.  This to me is the therapeutic, soothing effects of the powerful message of hope for peace and faith in oneself that is beaded into the wonder of words of these books.  It has been my pleasure to relate these journeys of life to you." />
