  <title>No Free Man - Graham Potts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No Free Man by Graham Potts, a fast-paced and gripping spy thriller bringing international espionage close to home.
“Graham Potts is the next Lee Child”.
Stepan Volkov forfeited his future when he was paid to forget his past.
Forced to adapt, he ultimately became the world&#39;s most wanted killer... feared, vicious and brutal.
A tool of the Organizatsiya, a Russian crime syndicate that forged him into &#39;The Wolf&#39;, he&#39;s pursued by American spies and Australian agents, torn between his need to survive and his desire to be free.
When a shock encounter in Australia uncovers forgotten secrets and threatens uneasy allegiances, Volkov suddenly sees a choice... one he thought would never be his to make.
With a billion-dollar international oil deal threatening to shift the global balance of power, will Volkov return to Moscow to wage war for the Organizatsiya, or will he find the courage to escape with a vengeful thief whose life he destroyed?" />
