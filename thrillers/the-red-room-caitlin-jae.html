  <title>The Red Room - Caitlin Jae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ember Welbin is the luckiest girl in the world. Or atleast she feels that way. At only nineteen she is a published author and getting married to the man she loves. What more could she ask for?
But on her wedding night, the most unexpected thing happens. A man she&#39;s never met before kidnaps her and steals her away from the man and life she loves so dearly. 
In the upcoming days Ember fights fiercely to escape and return home. But as the days drag by a new plan arises: learn who the man is and play along with his game until she can escape silently into the night.
But what she learns from him will change everything, forever." />
