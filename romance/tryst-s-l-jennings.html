  <title>Tryst - S. L. Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name is Heidi DuCane. I might seem like your average happily married woman with average desires. But don&amp;#8217;t let looks fool you. I have needs that are begging to be satisfied. So what do I want more than anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;I want my most secret fantasy fulfilled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have I got your interest now? Are you wondering what my most illicit, dark fantasy involves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want my husband, Tucker, to watch while another man brings me to pleasure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I do love Tucker, I&amp;#8217;ve always suspected there&amp;#8217;s much more out there waiting for me to explore. And my hunch was proven when I met rock superstar Ransom Reed&amp;#8212;every woman&amp;#8217;s wet dream. I would&amp;#8217;ve been insane not to take him up on his offer to share one wild night with him&amp;#8230;and Tucker. The sex was mind-blowing! And Tucker enjoyed himself as much as I did. But here&amp;#8217;s the catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sex was so good that one night wasn&amp;#8217;t enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Tucker nor I can stop thinking about that scorching hot night. My husband loves me so much that he&amp;#8217;ll do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to please me&amp;#8212;including helping me reach staggering heights of ecstasy with another man. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t just the sex that was enticing. I felt something come alive in me, and I felt so deliciously satisfied and loved by both men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Tucker and Ransom have made my most forbidden fantasies come true, I&amp;#8217;ve learned an important lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can never go back to the way things were before&amp;#8230;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
