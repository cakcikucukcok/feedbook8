  <title>Husband Wearing Wife&#39;s Clothes Stories: Caught in the Act - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Tonight, I am going to dress you up as a woman and you are going to be exactly that, a woman.&quot; She said.    &quot;But, what if I resist and don&#39;t want to?&quot; He said defiantly.    &quot;Well, then I will just have to post the video of you wearing women&#39;s clothes that I caught on my cell phone last week.&quot; She then held up her cell phone and showed him the video.     &quot;This will go out on the internet, to friends, co-workers and family members, then I will file for divorce and take full custody of our son, if you do not do what I say tonight.&quot; She said in a commanding and dominant voice.    Andrew knew he had no choice. He had to listen to his wife. He didn&#39;t want to lose her, his son or his marriage or to have anyone know about his cross dressing secret.    &quot;Now, I am going to dress you up to look like the woman you really are.&quot; She said.    Amy pulled out the short black micro mini dress that she had bought that week. She had also bought a black lace bra with matching panties." />
