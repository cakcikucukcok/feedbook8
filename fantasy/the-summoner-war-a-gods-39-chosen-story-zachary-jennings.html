  <title>The Summoner War: A Gods&#39; Chosen Story - Zachary Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the mercenary group employed by the city of Jenaut, Demons seem to remain as the only great threat they would ever see. Five years and the burden of life begin to set and stress bonds. Yet, a lone power sits upon the horizon and grows ever increasingly hostile towards them. A tense anger carried on the air in whispers and remains on the tips of tongues. A constricting and fearful power, it seems the mercenaries stand powerless before it. Aid comes from places unexpected and emerges from shadows of nightmares only to disappear when they turn. Shortly, they begin to understand that Sylsteruin, their world, contains more frightening entities than they ever could dream. One such entity, watching with a growing hunger, begins to question the very foundations the Gods set forth as the world tips closer to war between Summoners, heralds of Gods. Will they find themselves lost in the maws of creatures mad? Will they change the words as Fate reads them? She cannot know, no one can know." />
