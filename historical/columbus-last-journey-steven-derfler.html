  <title>Columbus’ Last Journey - Steven Derfler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the great adventurers and explorers of Spain&#39;s Golden Age of discovery was Cristoforo Colon, Christopher Columbus. His exploits centering on the discovery of new lands across the Atlantic gave rise to an incredible personality cult that bestowed upon the man an almost &#39;extra-human&#39; identity in western civilization history books. And, in spite of all that we now know of his exploitative and oftentimes destructive activity with regard to the native societies he encountered, this cult-like following maintains its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in recent years, Columbus&#39; background and identity have been questioned, and his faith is a matter of conjecture. To many, his true spirituality has threatened all that they have held dear- nationality, faith and allegiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everyone vying for bragging rights regarding his final resting place, it is no small wonder that the search for his tomb continues. His love of Cuba was deeply embedded in his psyche. Perhaps he made a &#39;final stop&#39; on his way back to Spain. Imagine the impact if he was &#39;rediscovered&#39; after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
