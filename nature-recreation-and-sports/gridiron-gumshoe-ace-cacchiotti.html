From young Steve Sabol&#39;s &quot;They Called it Pro Football&quot; produced in 1967, to &quot;Joe and the Magic Bean&quot; again written and produced by Steve in 1976, &quot;75 Seasons&quot;; &quot;The Story of the National Football League&quot; in 1994 to &quot;America&#39;s Game&quot; from 2005 and to the late NFL Films&#39; President&#39;s tribute; Steve Sabol, &quot;The Guts and Glory of Pro Football&quot; on February 12th, 2013, the game of Pro Football is watched by hundred of millions through the camera eye of what is without a doubt the measuring stick for all others when it comes to capturing passion in and on any field. This author was given a wonderful opportunity to express himself and by doing so left a legacy with not only my peers but with my late loving boss; my friend Steve Sabol.&lt;/p&gt;
