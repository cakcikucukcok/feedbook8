  <title>Legacy of Limga - Faye Roots</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Legacy of Limga continues the story of a family living in a small rural community with a gold-mining history in Queensland, Australia. The people in the story are all fictional, but the historical events are accurate. This story looks back from a 2015 perspective to retrace the legacy of a little girl born on the banks of the Mary River in Gympie in 1869. It will uncover her ongoing journey of faith, family, love, and heartache as the whole town grows from an insignificant small backblock town to a city through two world wars and the unfolding of incredible changes that swept the whole Australian continent during the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. This is the story of community courage and of Christian tenacity, but it is also the story of family and a legacy that resonates through generations that is more than about material possessions. Legacy relates to everyone who believes that love is stronger than hatred and that true courage is not just about triumphing in hard times but the hope that rises towards an even better tomorrow. Legacy is a journey through generations, and it traces peoples strength through the historical events, many of them tragic and challenging, in their lifetimes." />
