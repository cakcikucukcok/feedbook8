  <title>Einstein Continued... - David D. Miller, Martin O. Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gravity Explained from a Quantum Perspective: A fairly recent science magazine ran on its cover that over the past century, Einsteins Relativity theories have withstood the test of time. Can they now withstand the test of timelessness? In einstein continued The Missing Model of Motion, gravity is explained from a quantum perspective without the use of time through quantum momentum, quantum movement, quantum relativity, and quantum gravity. It also answers a question that should have been asked centuries ago: How does mass move through space in the first place? It explains Special and General Relativities from a quantum perspective, putting an end to the physicality of space-time. It also deals with some logical consequences of timelessness. And finally, it answers the question, Was Einstein Wrong? and puts the brilliance of his work back on course, leading to the ultimate destination of a unified theory." />
