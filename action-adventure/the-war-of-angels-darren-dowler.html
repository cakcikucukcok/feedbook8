  <title>The War of Angels - Darren Dowler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A story of adventure, friendship, love, betrayal and war. &quot;The WAR OF ANGELS&quot; takes us into a magical existence where heaven, hell and earth become one canvas for this epic story. Archangels, led by Michael and Sataniel (Satan) collide once more with the fury of the heavens, with man and earth trapped between they and their armies, their futures hanging on the outcome of the battle.
Three SETI scientists capture a satellite photo of the arrival of a mysterious being that has the power to alter mans future and change the course of the world.
On a remote Italian mountainside, the ancient secret order of monks known as the Montiarans encounter a visitor (The Archangel Michael) whose presence could mean peace for the world or the end of days.
Michael, while searching for his enemies, unknowingly risks all when he falls in love with a human woman, Charlie. Lowering his defenses and assuming temporary human form to be with her, he is mortally wounded, trapping him in his human state.. Leading his army now will surely mean his death. But the warrior summons his remaining strength and courage and charges onto the battlefield. Earth. Millions upon millions of Angels clash, destroying everything in their paths. 
The world explodes into mayhem as the stage is set for the largest battle the earth has ever seen and whose outcome will herald a new era for man. Will the days to come be the foretold thousand years of peace? Or is it the dawn of the rule of the beast?
When the end is near, the world will take sides. Which side will you choose?
And then night came upon the earth and the sun never again touched the face of man.
