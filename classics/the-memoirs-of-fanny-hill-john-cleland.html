  <title>The Memoirs Of Fanny Hill - John Cleland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This infamous novel details the many sexual adventures of the fictional maid-turned-prostitute, Fanny Hill, whose name has become synonymous with scandal and obscenity. Written while author John Cleland was in debtor’s prison, &lt;em&gt;The Memoirs of Fanny Hill&lt;/em&gt; is considered the first English example of a pornographic novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Memoirs of Fanny Hill&lt;/em&gt; was banned soon after publication in 1748, but was so widely pirated that it remained available until it was finally re-released 1960. However, after distributing more than 80,000 copies of the book, the publisher was forced to end production when it was charged under the Obscenity Act. &lt;em&gt;The Memoirs of Fanny Hill&lt;/em&gt; was finally published without legal repercussions in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
