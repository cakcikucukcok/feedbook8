  <title>Faith, Unity, Discipline - Muhammad Azam Zia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poetry book implores ways to recognize contemporary circumstances in an unorthodox and nostalgic manner so as to draw attention to lifes raw deal. There is contempt but with a noble motive: the desire to bring change in the thinking of the reader. Its principle reason over the long range is to bring about change through peace, hope and inspiration. One might say that it seeks to give us a fresh viewpoint on the incongruities and evils we live among, the evil we ignore or the evil that we, ourselves are.
Faith, Unity and Discipline is a collection of thoughts, a compilation of memories, a basket of hope, and a plea for humanity. Some pieces question the accepted norms of everyday life and some pieces try to put together the puzzles of faith and sincerity of effort. Each poem should be read under individual light as they were written in a spirit of independent thinking. If found and read after the life of the poet, the reader is urged to try to imagine the thoughts that must have affected the poet.
 After all, imagination is the most spectacular sense we, the humans possess." />
