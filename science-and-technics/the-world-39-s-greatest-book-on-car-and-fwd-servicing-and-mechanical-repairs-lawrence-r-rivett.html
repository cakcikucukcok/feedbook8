  <title>The World&#39;s Greatest Book on Car and Fwd Servicing and Mechanical Repairs - Lawrence R Rivett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For a long time, I have wanted to write this book to share my hard-earned secrets with the world on the secrets of the maintenance of cars as an engine reconditioner/mechanic. By trade, I have learnt many secrets of preventative maintenance to actually recondition an engine in a car and maintain it for hundreds of thousands of kilometres. I know that regular oil and filter changes and preventative maintenance make the difference between burning oil at one hundred kilometres and requiring a new engine and not burning any oil at four hundred kilometres because my maintenance schedule was followed following the recommendations under full servicing (chapter 3), and your car will last two and up to three times longer than normal, and if you want to restore or recondition any part of it, then it is all included in this book. Everything is outlined in fine detail on how to do everything. There are chapters in this book on servicing / engine reconditioning / transmission reconditioning / brakes / differential / clutches / painting and restoration of cars / stationary motors how to avoid the road toll / driving tips and techniques / checklist before driving / minor servicing /desert survival / refrigeration how to build your own refrigeration box / what can happen when you befriend the wrong people and much, much more. The complete book of everything to do with car engines and vehicle maintenance and travelling also written to professionally repair smoky car motors and stop the pollution they create worldwide. This book is written with the intention of saving drivers lives worldwide and is written with the utmost care. All the maintenance and servicing of cars is how the author has done it down to the finest detail over the years for his customers cars and never received a single complaint about his mechanical repair supreme ability. This book is written by an engineer who knows how to manufacture cars, not just repair and maintain them. This book is written under my pen name because my other book and future books will be written under my pen name. They are all written to warn the unwary to help those who need help and keep the public informed. Got questions about how to fix/repair cars? This book will answer them all. A must-have book for the car glove box." />
