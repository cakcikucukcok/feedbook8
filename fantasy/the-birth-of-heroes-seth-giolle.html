  <title>The Birth of Heroes - Seth Giolle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The two kings are cruel and unjust. The people cry out for freedom, and the Hawk fights in their name; only, he&#39;s but a youth, a teenager, and those people who&#39;d demand change are too scared to step forward and fight for it. The Hawk has his enchanted blade but little training and less support. Worse, he&#39;s learned to rely only on himself. That&#39;s no way to win a war. The Hawk finds an unlikely ally in Atkleas, and they find themselves students to a mage and sword master, Ferlenn Dri. Will that be enough? The world is still too frightened to stand up to the kings and their heavy hand. Or has the call for freedom begun to spread? Is there hope slowly brewing? The Hawk must learn to rely on others more than himself. He must learn to lead, or his rebellion will fail before it ever starts. This is the seventh book in my Prequel Stories series." />
