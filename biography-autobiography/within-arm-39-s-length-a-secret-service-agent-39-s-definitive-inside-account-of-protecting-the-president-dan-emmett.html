  <title>Within Arm&#39;s Length: A Secret Service Agent&#39;s Definitive Inside Account of Protecting the President - Dan Emmett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rare inside look at the Secret Service from an agent who provided protection worldwide for President George H. W. Bush, President William Clinton, and President George W. Bush&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Dan Emmett was just eight years old when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The events surrounding the President&#39;s death shaped the course of young Emmett&#39;s life as he set a goal of becoming a US Secret Service agent--one of a special group of people willing to trade their lives for that of the President, if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Within Arm&#39;s Length&lt;/i&gt; is a revealing and compelling inside look at the Secret Service and the elite Presidential Protective Division (PPD). With stories from some of the author&#39;s more high-profile assignments in his twenty-one years of service, where he provided arm&#39;s length protection worldwide for Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, and George W. Bush, both as a member of the PPD and the Counter Assault Team, Dan Emmett describes the professional, physical and emotional challenges faced by Secret Service agents. Included are never before discussed topics such as the complicated relationship between presidents, first ladies and their agents, the inner workings of Secret Service protective operations as well as the seldom-mentioned challenges of the complex Secret Service cultural issues faced by an agent&#39;s family. &lt;i&gt;Within Arm&#39;s Length&lt;/i&gt; also shares firsthand details about conducting presidential advances, dealing with the media, driving the President in a bullet-proof limousine, running alongside him through the streets of Washington, and flying with him on Air Force One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Within Arm&#39;s Length&lt;/i&gt; is the essential book on the United States Secret Service. This revealing and compelling inside look at the Presidential Protective Division, along with spellbinding stories from the author&#39;s career, gives the reader an unprecedented look in to the life and career of an agent in America&#39;s most elite law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;" />
