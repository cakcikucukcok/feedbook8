  <title>America&#39;s Secret Jihad: The Hidden History of Religious Terrorism in the United States - Stuart Wexler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The conventional narrative concerning religious terrorism inside the United States says that the first salvo occurred in 1993, with the first attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. This narrative has motivated more than a decade of wars, and re-prioritized America&amp;#8217;s domestic security and law enforcement agenda. But the conventional narrative is wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A different group of jihadists exists within US borders. This group has a long but hidden history, is outside the purview of public officials and has an agenda as apocalyptic as anything Al Qaeda has to offer. Radical sects of Christianity have inspired some of the most grotesque acts of violence in American history: the 1963 Birmingham Church bombing that killed four young girls; the &amp;#8220;Mississippi Burning&amp;#8221; murders of three civil rights workers in 1964; the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, the Atlanta Child Murders in the late 1970s; and the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995.America&#39;s Secret Jihad uses these crimes to tell a story that has not been told before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expanding upon the author&amp;#8217;s ground-breaking work on the Martin Luther King, Jr. murder, and through the use of extensive documentation, never-before-released interviews, and a re-interpretation of major events, America&#39;s Secret Jihad paints a picture of Christian extremism and domestic terrorism as it has never before been portrayed.&lt;/div&gt;" />
