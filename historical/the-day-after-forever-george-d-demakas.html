  <title>The Day After Forever - George D. Demakas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Perhaps it was coincidence or fate, beautiful Anna and Captain Nikolas met aboard a cruise ship, at that moment both knew it was true love, nothing will ever separate them but second World War was ravaging southern Europe, Germans paratroopers demolished Crete separating them loosing track of each other.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Anna suffers a lot but always keeps the faith, a cruel civil war made her turn into a warrior. Never loosing her humanness she helped friend and foe alike as a nurse. Destructive forces from East and West try to divide everything and everybody. The selfishness and jealousy of Melpomeni Bouras, her mother, along with the malevolence of Doctor Vassili Tsipras took advantage of Annas innocence and did everything possible to destroy her dreams.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After abducting her baby they drove Anna to the brink, the only hope that remained for her was God and keeping the faith that some day she would be reunited with Nikolas.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nikolas landed with the British in Egypt, but even after his ship and memories sank his strong belief, the help of a monastic and the love of his mother made him find his true self again. Or did he?&lt;/P&gt;" />
