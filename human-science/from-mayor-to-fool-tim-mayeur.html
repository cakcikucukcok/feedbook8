    	<p>From Mayor to Fool is a series of transcribed conversations that took place in Spring 2008, between the Author (Tim Mayeur), his parents, his close friends, two Tarot Card Readers, a Psychic Medium and a Hypnotherapist. It is a journey where you get to follow the Author as he transforms and comes to terms with his life, the loss of his sister, struggles with what it means to be a Middle Class Man and evaluates his life in order to improve it. There were no rehearsals and the Psychics were not given any information about Tims life prior to the meetings. Tim met them for the first time for these sessions. This is what happens when a nihilistic and skeptical man has a spiritual awakening. As a true story about the factors in ones life, it can be overwhelming, looking at all the possibilities and probabilities but in the end, people need to trust their own intuitions and judgment of where they want to go in life. Change involves stress and risk. Are you ready for a Change?</p>
