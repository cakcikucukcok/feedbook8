  <title>The Vice President - Elina Salajeva, Elinadeivid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When humanity needed courage, hope and a solution and when an effective plan was needed, one that required greater execution and precision to defeat death. There was only one person to stand the test of times. The Vice President. A formidable force to be reckoned with, the symbol of the American dream, rich, powerful and ruthless. A woman with a quest for power and world domination and a great vision not only to cheat death but to eliminate death and aging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A brilliant plan, no limits, no room for mistakes. A great discovery and a lot to lose.&lt;br /&gt;
For the first time in the history of mankind the Vice President had more power than any President. This was not a coincidence, a new and equally never seen before threat was on the horizon. The rise of the death-partners.&lt;br /&gt;
Death had a new genius plan; Why not go in twos or groups? But was death the sole reason for such strange behavior or this was mankind&amp;rsquo;s instincts to survive?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Was this the end of the world?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Faced with a new threat on the horizon man&amp;rsquo;s natural instincts kicked in; group together to cheat death or perish. Was this mankind&amp;rsquo;s clever plan or another unforeseeable genius plan by the devil?&lt;br /&gt;
In a world where finding your double is the key to longevity. What will it take to cheat death?&lt;br /&gt;
Trust anyone and your fate is sealed. Until the end you will never guess who to trust and can the Vice President save humanity?&lt;/p&gt;" />
