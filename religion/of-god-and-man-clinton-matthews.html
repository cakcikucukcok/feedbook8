  <title>Of God and Man - Clinton Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no credit to be taken by the author for this work, especially since the major part of this work is not his own but rather the words of the Lord God extracted from the scriptures. These things are written as the testimony of a humble servant of the Lord God and become the only legacy and expression of a son of God who has nothing else to leave the world following his short sojourn among those of mortality. It is hoped that they may be of some use and accomplish some good in bringing about a more righteous world for the glory of God. God has created all things for mankind, and it is hoped that men might be found to be worthy of all that the Lord God has prepared for man. There is much beauty and wonder to be found in what the Lord has done. May we be wise enough to take full advantage of what can be our inheritance both in this life and in that life to come." />
