  <title>Chalk&#39;s Woman - David Ballantine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David Ballantine&#39;s debut novel &lt;i&gt;Chalk&#39;s Woman&lt;/i&gt;, is a story about freedom, liberation, and love. Set in the violent backdrop of the waning months of the Civil War, &lt;i&gt;Chalk&#39;s Woman&lt;/i&gt; addresses violence and redemption as seen through the eyes of a girl maturing into a woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann, a fourteen-year-old girl, wakes up after a terrible explosion in a make-shift hospital during the waning months of the Civil War--her house no longer stands and her mother is dead, and a young Dr. Frazier amputated her arm in order to to prevent infection. . Homeless and an orphaned, Ann feels her only option is to travel west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She leaves Vicksburg on the Santa Fe Trail and meets a troupe of orphaned children like herself and joins up with them. Together they fight against the hardships of the wild frontier: abominable weather, savage Indians, and starvation all the way to Kansas where they meet and, much to his chagrin, fall in love with Chalk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chalk&#39;s not the nicest of men, and he sure does have a drinking problem, but from the moment Chalk and Ann see each other, they know their lives will forever be entwined.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
