  <title>Wide Open - Deborah Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wide Open&lt;/i&gt; by Deborah Coates is the first book in a series of &quot;startlingly original&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;) contemporary fantasy novels set against the sweeping prairies and desolate byways of the American Midwest, creating &quot;a rural backwater where the normal and paranormal seamlessly merge.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sergeant Hallie Michaels comes back to South Dakota from Afghanistan on ten days&#39; compassionate leave, her sister Dell&#39;s ghost is waiting at the airport to greet her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff says that Dell&#39;s death was suicide, but Hallie doesn&#39;t believe it. Something happened or Dell&#39;s ghost wouldn&#39;t still be hanging around. Friends and family, mourning Dell&#39;s loss, think Hallie&#39;s letting her grief interfere with her judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one person who seems willing to listen is the deputy sheriff, Boyd Davies, who shows up everywhere and helps when he doesn&#39;t have to.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hallie asks more questions, she attracts new ghosts, women who disappeared without a trace.  Soon, someone&#39;s trying to beat her up, burn down her father&#39;s ranch, and stop her investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hallie&#39;s going to need Boyd, her friends, and all the ghosts she can find to defeat an enemy who has an unimaginable ancient power at his command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wide Open&lt;/i&gt; has been nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a First Novel, appeared on &lt;i&gt;Locus Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Recommended Reading List for first novels, and was chosen as a Tor.com Reviewer&#39;s Choice Pick for Favorite Book of the year.  &lt;i&gt;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&lt;/i&gt; claimed that it is &quot;one of the best first novels I&#39;ve read in a long time&quot; and &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; agrees that &quot;fans of urban fantasies should enjoy the kick-ass [heroine].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
