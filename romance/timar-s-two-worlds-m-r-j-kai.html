  <title>Timar?s Two Worlds - Mór Jókai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;M&amp;oacute;ric J&amp;oacute;kay de &amp;Aacute;sva&lt;/b&gt; , known as &lt;i&gt;M&amp;oacute;r J&amp;oacute;kai&lt;/i&gt;; (18 February 1825 &amp;ndash; 5 May 1904),&amp;nbsp; was a Hungarian dramatist, novelist and revolutionary. He was active participant and a leading personality in the outbreak of Hungarian Liberal Revolution of 1848 in Pest. J&amp;oacute;kai&amp;#39;s romantic novels became very popular among the elite of Victorian era England, he was often compared to Dickens in the 19th century British press.One of his most famous fan and admirer was Queen Victoria herself. &amp;ldquo;Timar&amp;rsquo;s Two Worlds&amp;rdquo; is a &amp;quot;Sensation fiction&amp;quot; of its time, which is domestic drama gone overboard. Though often listed as early science fiction, it in fact contains not a single speccy thing, but an epilogue chapter on a communal village based on a mother and daughter who lived cashless on an island. This counts rather as a Utopian &amp;quot;modern dialogue&amp;quot; rather than fiction, as it has no plot or story arc. The main story is quite a time-trip to Hungary, and somewhat fascinating if, by modern standards, slow to develop. Once it gets going, you may be surprised how wild things get--by Victorian standards." />
