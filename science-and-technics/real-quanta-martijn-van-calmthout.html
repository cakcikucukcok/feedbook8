  <title>Real Quanta - Martijn van Calmthout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr walk into the famous Hotel Métropole and sit down at the author’s table to discuss the state of quantum mechanics today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Quantum mechanics seems to be just about as weird as physics can get. Particles that are waves. That can be in several places at once. That can be affected by what happens to each other when they are miles apart, not just close by. And until somebody looks at Schrödinger’s cat, it is both alive and dead.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
They sound like stories from a distant, peculiar world. But nothing could be further from the truth. In &lt;i&gt;Real Quanta&lt;/i&gt;, science journalist Martijn van Calmthout makes it crystal clear that quantum magic has now extended its scope way beyond isolated laboratories and complex experiments. The quantum has become real, perfectly normal. The strange thing is that we still pay so little attention to it. In contemporary 2016, &lt;i&gt;Real Quanta&lt;/i&gt; pictures the physicists Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr walking into the famous Hotel Métropole in Brussels and taking a seat at the author’s table. Nearly a century ago, this is where they had their legendary disputes about quantum mechanics. Now it’s time to take stock of developments since then." />
