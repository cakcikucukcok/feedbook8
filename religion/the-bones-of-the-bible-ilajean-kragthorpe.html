  <title>The Bones of the Bible - IlaJean  Kragthorpe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible is a book concerned with faith. Because God is a God of relationship, the Bible traces the lives of many who had a relationship with God, as well as many who did not. In the Bible, God tells Hosea, &quot;for I am God and no mortal,&quot; (11:9). Simply put, this scripture teaches us that God does not choose as we do. For example, he delivers The Ten Commandments into the hands of a murderer, a non-Jewish prostitute is chosen to become the great-great grandmother of King David of Israel, and a hated Samaritan becomes the hero of one of Jesus&#39; most enduring parables. These Biblical figures can teach us much about grace, faith, courage, and repentance. Through brief daily readings, The Bones of the Bible reviews and makes relevant some of the people and events of each book of the Bible, all within the course of a year. You will discover that their journeys are not that different from our own and that the one constant we can depend on is the grace of a loving God." />
