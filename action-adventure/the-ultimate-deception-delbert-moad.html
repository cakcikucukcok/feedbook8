  <title>The Ultimate Deception - Delbert Moad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two men from humble beginnings and living a continent apart may be destined to become the two most powerful men in the world. As the plan of one and the dream of the other intersect, neither has any idea of the powerful chain of events about to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Stevens is a bright young man facing an uncertain future. His father, Raul Contreras, is a man of vision and infinite patience, but most importantly a man of action. Raul and his business associate, Rafael Saltas, hold the reins to an empire that rivals those of ancient European warlords. Paul is caught between his fathers dream and the harsh reality of his drug empire. As he attempts to meet his fathers expectations, Paul soon finds himself becoming more and more like him every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Caroline Williams, Rafaels strong-willed daughter, struggles to come to terms with her fathers outdated restrictions. Helplessly caught in their fathers webs of deceit, Paul and Caroline align themselves with a charismatic future presidential candidate without any idea that a determined DEA agent is hot on their trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this political thriller, time is of the essence as Paul and Caroline sacrifice nearly everything in a valiant attempt to achieve their fathers dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
