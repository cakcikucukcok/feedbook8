  <title>Copper Flashings And Weatherings - A Practical Handbook - Various Authors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This handbook has been compiled to give essentially practical details of the manner in which copper sheet and strip are used for flashings and weatherings of all normal types. It is intended especially for those who actually have to carry out the work, though it will, no doubt, also be of interest to thosc concerned with design or specification. In carrying out such flashings and weatherings to buildings the craftsman may come across certain individual problems not illustrated in the following pages, but it is hoped that by studying the methods shown a satisfactory solution to the problem will be found. However, if some point arises that is not covered by the foregoing remarks, the Copper Development Association would welconle the opportunity to advise the reader on the best methods to be used. In dealing with copper sheet or strip it must be realised that whilc the technique to be employed calls for no special skill or training, it is important that a little extra care and forethought should be given to setting out the work this will amply repay the craftsman, and a knowledge of the physical properties of thc metal will enable him to produce work equal to that of the old craftsmen whose efforts were renowned. The aim of the sheet copper worker must be to achieve the necessary shape or form with as little actual working of the metal as possible. Thus it will be seen that the working technique of other metals is not always applicable. Since the first appearance of this book in 1947, a Supplement containing 14 pages of additional details has been issued and distributed to recipients of thc first edition. This extra matter has been incorporated in the present edition." />
