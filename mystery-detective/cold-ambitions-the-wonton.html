  <title>Cold Ambitions - The Wonton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the few consistent aspects of my life is that I can be described as a people watcher. It is a hobby I engage in every time I am in the presence of others. From my observations there is no trait that we humans possess more obvious, consistent, plentiful, and yet, undeservedly shunned as a monstrosity of power hungry men, than the very trait of ambition. I am still always a little surprised when a cringe follows the allegation of such conduct. If thought about in an everyday context I could envision few circumstances, outside of the atom bomb, which would evoke that same recoil. Certainly, I would say, no one would detest written language, civilization, interstellar technologies, and every other realm where mans ambition carries us onward and upward.
	I do, however, fully recognize the dark side of mans desire and confess my intent fascination in it. I find it oddly commendable the risks some are willing to take. If administered in the right dosage ones success cannot be quantified. But as in life people do choose to overdose. It is in these choices, and the consequences thereof, where the book resides most heavily." />
