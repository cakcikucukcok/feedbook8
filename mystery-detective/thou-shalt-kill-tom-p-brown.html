  <title>Thou Shalt Kill - Tom P. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2019, America is bordering on financial collapse after engaging in a third conflict in Iraq. On the home front, the president has provided funding for stem cell research, but medical success is overshadowed after corporate greed intervenes. The intention to benefit those with the greatest need quickly disappears as the replication process is used to clone all major organs. 
With the advent of cloning, the inevitable occurs when Americas population reaches the saturation point. A chip is now implanted into all citizens, which signals when someone reaches the mandatory age of death. Years left on a chip are for sale, and the hunt for new chips is on. Meanwhile, overseas, the war rages, where people die irrespective of age.
Lieutenant Roger DeMarco must put an end to the murder of entire innocent Iraqi villages by those who would harvest the enemy and civilians alike. Doctors are caught on opposing sides of science, and even a reality TV star becomes of national interest when he sells his chip and plans to slowly kill himself in a parade of hedonism. Progress, profit, and morality collide with stunning ferocity as America must evolve or die." />
