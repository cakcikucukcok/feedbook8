  <title>Believe Me - Yolanda Hadid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the star of&lt;i&gt; The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/i&gt; comes an emotional and eye opening behind-the-scenes look at her descent into uncovering the mystery of chronic Lyme disease.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2011, Yolanda was struck by mysterious symptoms including brain fog, severe exhaustion, migraines and more. Over the months and years that followed, she went from being an outspoken, multi-tasking, hands-on mother of three, reality TV star, and social butterfly, to a woman who spent most of her time in bed. Yolanda was turned inside out by some of the country&#39;s top hospitals and doctors, but due to the lack of definitive diagnostic testing, she landed in a dark maze of conflicting medical opinions, where many were quick to treat her symptoms but could never provide clear answers to their possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this moving, behind the scenes memoir, Yolanda Hadid opens up in a way she has never been able to in the media before. Suffering from late stage Lyme, a disease that is an undeniable epidemic and more debilitating than anyone realizes, Yolanda had to fight with everything she had to hold onto her life. While her struggle was lived publicly, it impacted her privately in every aspect of her existence, affecting her family, friends and professional prospects. Her perfect marriage became strained and led to divorce. It was the strong bond with her children, Gigi, Bella and Anwar, that provided her greatest motivation to fight through the darkest days of her life. Hers is an emotional narrative and all-important read for anyone unseated by an unexpected catastrophe. With candor, authenticity and an unwavering inner strength, Yolanda reveals intimate details of her journey crisscrossing the world to find answers for herself and two of her children who suffer from Lyme and shares her tireless research into eastern and western medicine. &lt;i&gt;Believe Me &lt;/i&gt;is an inspiring lesson in the importance of having courage and hope, even in those moments when you think you can&#39;t go on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
