  <title>Beyond Basic Dog Training - Diane L. Bauman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since its initial publication, Beyond Basic Dog Training has achieved well deserved recognition as an innovative, unique guide to obedience instruction. Obedience authority Diane Bauman&#39;s proven training philosophy asserts that the time has come to go beyond training dogs and start teaching them to please us. This has made a vital difference for those who use her method-and for dogs taught by it to succeed in competitive canine sports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this new, updated edition, Bauman presents the most current knowledge on canine learning patterns. Believing that dogs learn by trial and error, Bauman provides a novel approach that encourages dogs to learn by removing corrections for incorrect responses. As a result, dogs do not fear failure and are taught to exercise options in a quest for the desired behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bauman shows you how to become a &quot;thinking handler&quot; who can train the &quot;thinking dog.&quot; Her remarkable ability to view training from the dog&#39;s perspective translates into an invaluable tool for building effective communication between you and your dog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The instruction in this authoritative guide is behind Gaines &quot;Superdogs,&quot; numerous obedience trial champions, and a host of other canine successes. If you want your dog to be happy, confident stimulated, and secure in the obedience ring, Beyond Basic Dog Training is the book of choice." />
