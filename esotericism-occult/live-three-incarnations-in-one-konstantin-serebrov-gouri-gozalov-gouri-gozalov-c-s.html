  <title>Live Three Incarnations in One - Konstantin Serebrov, Gouri Gozalov, Gouri Gozalov c.s.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After some time, Master G sent Konstantin to learn on his own from G&amp;rsquo;s former followers in Moscow. Each of them had absorbed a small part of the alchemical teaching and Konstantin had to persuade them to teach him that small part. But these former followers had no wish whatsoever to teach him anything at all. The reason was, as G put it, that they deviated from the Path and had become some kind of &amp;lsquo;statues, frozen in ritual postures in the alchemical labyrinth&amp;rsquo;. G advised Konstantin to try to worm the knowledge out of them by going with them through &amp;lsquo;the school of servitude and humbleness&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In the present book, which is the second book of the Trilogy &amp;lsquo;Lessons of Master G&amp;rsquo;, entitled &amp;lsquo;Live three Incarnations in One&amp;rsquo;, this latter stage of the teaching process is described. The reader &amp;nbsp;learns of the incredible situations Konstantin and Gouri, who sometimes joined him, had to go through to carry out the task given to them. Konstantin knew, however, that he could only proceed on the spiritual Path if he succeeded in his task.&lt;br /&gt;
