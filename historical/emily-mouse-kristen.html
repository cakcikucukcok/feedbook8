  <title>Emily  Mouse - Kristen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emily Mouse&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Air Marshal John Campbell returns to his familys estate. Hobbington Manor lies just south of Woodstock in Oxfordshire England. With no ambitions, to join the family, firm. Johns attention soon turns to Hannah Miles. Those close to him meddle in his budding relationship with Hannah. Peter Jamison the co-pilot in Johns Lancaster flight crew accepts Johns invitation to his stately Manor home. Falling in love with Emily, Peter conceals his family secret from those around him at the Manor. Amidst the turmoil, the hand of fate has dealt and his brothers confrontation. John turns to Anne Foster, confiding in her. Anne harbors Johns passion for a farming life and admiration.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Johns acquisition of Bach Llwyd Llygoden and Glen Usk fulfills a passion. They move to the Welsh countryside on the Ithon River, just east of Llandrindod Wells. A move, which Anne knows within her heart, is just the stepping-stone. Together they discover the joys and sobering heartaches of the Welsh Pastoralists life. In an unexpected meeting with an Australian RAAF colleague who reignites Johns passions. For the land of searing heat, the musters and the shearing shed. The smell of Gidgee trees on the morning air, and Thargo Rain. The wonders, the flooding river water brings to barren, sun patched earth. Is River Gum Station the answer to quench this passion? John wonders standing at the kitchen window looking out at the snow covered land of Bach Llwyd Llygoden.&lt;/p&gt;" />
