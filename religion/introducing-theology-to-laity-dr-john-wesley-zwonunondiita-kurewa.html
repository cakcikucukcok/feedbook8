  <title>Introducing Theology to Laity - Dr. John Wesley Zwonunondiita Kurewa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As John Kurewa and his brother talked about a tragic bus crash that had occurred nearby, his brother said, &quot;Well, that shows when your time to die has come, there is nothing you can do about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it really God&#39;s will for all those people to die or be injured in that wreck? By together delving into the meaning of the event, and into God&#39;s nature, the author and his brother came to a more profound understanding of God&#39;s purpose regarding the events of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenged by their discussion, and reminded that theology is for the whole church not just clergy, the author wrote &lt;em&gt;Introducing Theology to Laity&lt;/em&gt; to encourage all Christians to engage in the study of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although written for lay people, the book doesn&#39;t water down its view of Christian theology. Instead, it explores clearly and thoroughly the doctrines of God, creation, humanity, sin, the problem of evil and God&#39;s providence, and the Holy Spirit, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introducing Theology to Laity&lt;/em&gt; is an invitation to all believers to dig deeper into knowing God&amp;mdash;through study and experience. As the author says, &quot;God is not a thing to be scientifically investigated; rather, theology investigates faith&amp;mdash;that living relationship in God.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
