  <title>Pharsexia: The Adult Version of The Escapades of Caesar - Anonymous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mighty Caesar has installed himself indelibly in the annals of history... as a ruler... a warrior... and a lover. From childhood on... we have read and been taught... about the exploits of Caesar as a ruler and warrior. Now... we are presenting our version of the remarkable sexual exploits of Caesar. He ruled with an iron hand and commanded complete loyalty from his followers. He believed that he was guided by his Gods and that he was one of their chosen children... infallible and destined for a unique place in history... although his people did not all share his beliefs. The Roman Empire was in the throes of a full conversion to a democratic state... and while Caesar was one of the exponents... he still felt that he was far above the state and the dictates of the Senate. His sex life was never complete or fulfilled... as his conquests brought him a constant supply of the most choice morsels of femininity. He took them as he took his military victories... always leaving a burning hunger for more. Here is the tale of the mighty Caesar... Caesar the man." />
