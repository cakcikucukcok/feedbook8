  <title>How We’D Look on Film - Kai Gorbahn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Dray Emerald, it all started back in Grade 11 when he was sixteen years old, when life was simple and he know who he was and how to be happy. Thats when he had a crush on the perfect girl, Anna Markus. But when she moved away from their hometown of Smithers, British Columbia, everything began to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dray, a once-perfect Mormon boyturns his back on his faith and family and gets caught up in a world of drugs and alcohol. He gets kicked out of the rich and privileged life his parents have handed him. Planning on hitting the road without ever looking back, fate keeps him in town for one last summer. At the age of seventeen, he finds himself living in his own apartment. For the first time in his life, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has the chance to win over Anna, whos back in town for summer break, but hes torn between her and the lovely Rose Miller, his hometown sweetheart and longtime friend. Things slowly tilt into place as the seasons change. By coming to terms with the world around himhis friends, family, and his hometown of Smithershe nears closer to solving the mystery in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
