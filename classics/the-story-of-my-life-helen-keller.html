  <title>The Story of My Life - Helen Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When she was 19 months old, Helen Keller suffered a severe illness that left her blind and deaf. Not long after, she also became mute. Her tenacious struggle to overcome these handicaps-with the help of her inspired teacher, Anne Sullivan-is one of the great stories of human courage and dedication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Helen Keller&amp;#39;s remarkable determination helped her overcome many of her constraints, until she became the famed author that we all know and love. This book is a significant milestone in Keller&amp;#39;s life, presenting all the good and bad of her youth and childhood, and offering a detailed, unprecedented glimpse into a world without sound or light that is still surprisingly alive and thriving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to be inspired, you will definitely enjoy every moment of The Story of My Life, its genuine qualities transcending everything we know about the world through our dominant senses, and presenting us with the beauty of enjoying a flower&amp;#39;s motion and fragrance, instead of focusing solely on its outward beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
