  <title>100 Questions and Answers - Andrew E. Igene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lord told me to write this book, to bring believers back to the foundations of our most holy faith and to set the pattern (preparation) for Gods next move in revival. 
Indeed, this is the hour of true prophetic alignment of latter-rain teaching and deliverance anointings. But there has been a missing link.... that of returning to the basics, instead of the false populist doctrines of neo-apostles. 
This book fills the gap and restores the missing part of the puzzle. True prophets and teachers will find this book helpful and complementary, because it is a work of the Spirit. 
Author ANDREW IGENE declares that the glory of the Lord is coming to prepared and willing vessels, who are active in the Harvest field, revealing Jesus and His Word. Gods Word and His Spirit are one! We must clean up the House for Him to dwell in (by His Spirit). 
This prophetic cry will energize your faith with truth and boldness. This is your time to receive. This is your time to reign in Christ Jesus! 
Traveling Apostle, evangelist, teacher and revivalist, he moves in prophetic and deliverance anointings. His unique teaching ministry has blessed Gods people in revivals, conferences, outreaches, with signs and miracles. With unwavering passion for evangelism, discipleship and prophetic mentoring, he carries his mission to the nations! 
Former TV and Newspaper journalist, Igene also served as Chairman, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Edo State (1988-1992) 
His ministry moves as a prophetic voice to Gods people and to leaders of nations. 
He is President of Living Gospel International Ministries, Dallas, TX, USA.
