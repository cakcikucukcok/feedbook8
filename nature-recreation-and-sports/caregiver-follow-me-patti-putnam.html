  <title>Caregiver Follow Me - Patti Putnam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CAREGIVER FOLLOW ME is a unique book for chief caregivers of Alzheimers patients living at home.  Patti has heard the caregivers pleas for help and has done something about it.  Caregivers need help and that help can come in the form of a specially trained dog; an Alzheimers dog that the caregiver can train themselves.  Patti knows her subject from twenty-five years of hands-on-experience and generously gives her knowledge in language a lay person can understand.  For clarification she uses photographs, illustrations, stories, and diagrams.  The dogs explicit job is wander control and Pattis humane training methods have been proven to work.  All of the training techniques that Patti developed for the Alzheimers dogs are available to you.  She knows that caregivers will experience pure joy as they journey with her in creating an Alzheimers dog that becomes their partner in the confrontation against dementia.  Together they can keep their loved one at home where they can provide maximum care with less stress.  Using Pattis personal knowledge of her subject matter you will craft a working partnership with your dog that gives you peace of mind and offers a myriad of therapeutic benefits for your patient, yourself, and your entire family.  
Wouldnt it be nice to get a good nights sleep knowing that your dog is affectionately watching over your loved one listening for, hearing, and recognizing a potential wandering situation?  There would be no more, What did I hear?  Is she up?  Should I get up again and check?  Your dog will handle this for you and be absolutely delighted to perform its job.  The only wage that your dog asks for is your acknowledgement that it has done its job, has pleased you, and will get oodles of your love.
Primary to your success is establishing the idea that each training session, from the dogs viewpoint, is a game it can play with you for its entire life.  You will be teaching your dog nine steps that, once put together, will be known as the pattern, which the dog will execute in order to successfully complete its work task.  These nine steps are taught from within five different environments; each one getting progressively more challenging for the dog.  This way you can efficiently teach the dog what it must learn to become an Alzheimers dog.  Learn its language and listen to its voice--your dog is already reading you.  Take pride in yourself and your dog.  Teach your dog to hear for you." />
