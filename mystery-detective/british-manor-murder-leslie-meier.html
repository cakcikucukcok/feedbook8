  <title>British Manor Murder - Leslie Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reading a new Lucy Stone mystery is like catching up with a dear old friend.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Kate Carlisle,&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s  a nippy spring in Tinker&amp;rsquo;s Cove, Maine, and so Lucy Stone can&amp;rsquo;t wait to  join her friend Sue at the Earl of Wickham&amp;rsquo;s manor in England for the  &amp;ldquo;Heads Up!&amp;rdquo; hat exhibition&amp;mdash;even if she has to spend her entire holiday  curtseying. But at Moreton Manor, privileged life isn&amp;rsquo;t always tea and  crumpets . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; Although Perry, the earl of the house, and  his sister, Poppy, are surprisingly accommodating to their jetlagged  guests, Lucy feels uneasy after a fallen portrait sparks talk of a  deadly family omen. The bad vibes come in quickly&amp;mdash;snobby Aunt Millicent  and her handmaiden Harrison unexpectedly drop by for the exhibition, and  meals with the family are consistently tense. But real trouble begins  when a body, bludgeoned by the chapel&amp;rsquo;s gold-plated reliquary, is found  in a hidden, sealed off room. Stranger still, the corpse is identified  as Harrison&amp;rsquo;s son, Cyril.&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; Considering the weapon and the  clandestine location, Lucy wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be shocked if the murder was an  inside job. Cyril wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a gentleman, and it&amp;rsquo;s unclear what  business he had on the property. Was the victim trying to make off with  the family riches before meeting his end? Or was a scorned country  squire looking to settle an ancient indiscretion for good? One thing&amp;rsquo;s  for sure&amp;mdash;the criminal is privy to Moreton Manor secrets . . .&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; To end the reign of terror, Lucy must keep her ear to the ground and  mind time-honored traditions&amp;mdash;no matter how unusual. Because Lucy has a  hunch that the killer has been in her company all along, just waiting  for a chance to make blueblood run red . . .&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for Leslie Meier and her Lucy Stone Mysteries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; &amp;ldquo;I like Lucy Stone a lot, and so will readers.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Carolyn Hart&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; &amp;ldquo;Leslie Meier writes with sparkle and warmth.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Chicago Sun Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; &amp;ldquo;The Lucy Stone mysteries will appeal to fans of domestic mysteries.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;ldquo;Mothers everywhere will identify with Lucy Stone and the domestic problems she encounters.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
