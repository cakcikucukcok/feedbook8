  <title>Honour Be Damned - David Donachie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Honour Be Damned&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; finds the fiery British lieutenant in the waning days of the French Revolution. The revolution is turning in on itself &amp;amp;#150; Robespierre has met the guillotine &amp;amp;#150; but still the French fight on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After completing the siege of a French fortress in Corsica, Markham and his men are assigned to a sloop under the impetuous Captain Germain. Before long, Germain&amp;amp;#8217;s foolhardy hunt for glory throws Markham and his &amp;amp;#145;Lobsters&amp;amp;#8217; into desperate ship-to-ship action. Fortunately, fighting hand to hand is what the battle-hardened Marines do best. Like Markham, Germain has been branded a coward, but in his zeal to restore his good name he sets Markham on another, more perilous venture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This time, Markham must go ashore to escort a group of French royalists on a secret mission. Dodging the French army patrols would be difficult enough, but it is particularly hazardous because he is shackled with a French count, a devious Catholic prelate, a young lady, and their contingent of servants. But what is the secret prize they are hunting forà Why have they embarked on this fool&amp;amp;#8217;s errandà Markham must answer these questions as he untangles the deceit and subterfuge all around him. He must rely on the loyalty of his men and the ever-grudging assistance of Sergeant Rannoch to succeed in this most unusual and dangerous mission &amp;amp;#150; one complicated by the unexpected arrival of a figure from Markham&amp;amp;#8217;s past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
