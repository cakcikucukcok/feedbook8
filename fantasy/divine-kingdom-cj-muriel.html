      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-five thousand years into the future, humankind is abandoned to live in post-apocalyptic dystopia. Our faith in our Creator and his Son is reinvigorated by the evils we have been forced to face. Yet from beyond the harrowing darkness of this future, the DuQuethsa family reinforced by the living bloodline of the Messiahemerges to guide the souls of humanity through to the light. 
Anastacia DuQueth and her sister, Angelika, along with their personal bodyguards, are forced to abandon their flagshipthe Revelanceas it is overrun by demons. Although Anastacia is able to flee, Angelika is left behindleaving Anastacia to live with the guilt for over sixty years. But the Revelance returns with Angelika at the helm and the minions of hell itself as her passengers. With Joviahs Hand of Vengeance by Angelikas side to rule over all of humankind, Anastacia DuQueth must decide whether to beg for forgiveness or leave the fate of their order, the kingdom of humanity, and their very souls hanging in the balance. 
In this sister-versus-sister battle, will Angelika succeed in aiding her sisters fall from grace? Or can Anastacia raise her sword against her own blood? Will she? Will you  follow? Or will you  fall?" />
