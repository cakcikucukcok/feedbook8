  <title>Byrd&#39;s Eye View - Bruce Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time capsules are created when a number of meaningful treasures are gathered and then buried deep into the earth for posterity. After the burial ceremony concludes, the hope is a future generation will retrieve it so they might look closely at lives once lived. 
In Byrds Eye View, four neighborhood children create a time capsule at a pivotal moment when their world unexpectedly becomes a very dangerous place. They vow to return one day when the world is less threatening to retrieve the personal items theyd once buried. 
Eve Rostow could not have imagined forty years later that it would ruin her life and reveal a frightening secret. With help from friend Adam Byrd, she begins a painful search to find who discovered their capsule and why someone is using it to destroy her. 
A story of intrigue, menace, and even murder, not to mention a fast-paced and compelling novel with many twists and turns. This is a riveting read." />
