Lewis Carroll&amp;#39;s first appearance of Alice&amp;#39;s Adventures in Wonderland was a much shorter work titled Alice&amp;#39;s Adventures Under Ground. Although the final product is well known for John Tenniel&amp;#39;s memorable illustrations, Carroll himself illustrated his original manuscript. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, many of Tenniel&amp;#39;s illustrations were actually based on Carroll&amp;#39;s own. Carroll gave the original, handwritten manuscript to Alice Liddell, the girl for whom his heroine was named." />
