  <title>The Soul’S Famine - A.T. Haessly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary Olamuk begins her life in the trying times of South Africa&#39;s Apartheid. Having little, her family is taken in by a successful businessman. Mr. Hemingston becomes her surrogate father. She takes it upon herself to follow the teachings of the Hemingstons and her idolized brother until the innocence of youth is torn from her hands.
She loses much in her lifetime, but still she continues to strive for her dream of becoming a doctora healer to those in need regardless of color or class. All was on track, but fate often places us on another road.
Her life is taken from her, yet death does not keep her. Years pass, the world changes, and the youth slumbers. She is risen from her rest to the life of a developing Horseman. 
Angels, demons, and false priests will all play a role in the metamorphosis of Mary, the sister of Conquest and War . She will find her place in the world as the bringer of pestilence and plagues. She must adventure down the path the universe has set for her for her grand becoming. 
Famine will ride." />
