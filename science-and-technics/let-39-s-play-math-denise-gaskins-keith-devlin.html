  <title>Let&#39;s Play Math - Denise Gaskins, Keith Devlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Transform your child&amp;rsquo;s experience of math!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you struggled with math in school, you can help your children enjoy learning and prepare them for academic success.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author Denise Gaskins makes it easy with this mixture of math games, low-prep project ideas, and inspiring coffee-chat advice from a veteran mother of five. Filled with stories and illustrations, &lt;i&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Play Math&lt;/i&gt; offers a practical, activity-filled exploration of what it means to learn math as a family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drawing on more than thirty years&amp;#39; teaching and homeschooling experience, Gaskins provides helpful tips for parents with kids from preschool to high school, whether your children learn at home or attend a traditional classroom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sections include:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Understand Math:&lt;/b&gt; Introduce your children to the thrill of conquering a challenge. Build deep understanding by thinking, playing, and asking questions like a mathematician.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playful Problem Solving:&lt;/b&gt; Awaken your children&amp;rsquo;s minds to the beauty and wonder of mathematics. Discover the social side of math, and learn games for players of all ages.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Math with Living Books:&lt;/b&gt; See how mathematical ideas ebb and flow through the centuries with this brief tour through history. Can your kids solve puzzles from China, India, or Ancient Egypt?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Practical:&lt;/b&gt; Fit math into your family&amp;rsquo;s daily life, help your children develop mental calculation skills, and find out what to try when your child struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resources and References:&lt;/b&gt; With so many library books and Internet sites, you&amp;rsquo;ll never run out of playful mathematical adventures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
All parents and teachers share one goal: we want our children to understand and be able to use math. Your children will gain a strong foundation when you approach math as a family game, playing with ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t let your children suffer from the epidemic of math anxiety. Grab a copy of &lt;i&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Play Math,&lt;/i&gt; and start enjoying math today." />
