  <title>Modern Day Miracles - Rosa Morales, Annie Reyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life has its ups and downs but knowing who God is and understanding that He will not leave you or forsake will help you focus on what is truly important.
Two women who were blessed with 35 years of friendship share short stories of their lives and how God has continually manifested his love for them.  Each story gives hope, and nourishes the soul with the understanding of Gods love for us.
Annie and Rose throughout the years have shared many a great afternoons chatting about the trials and joys that they have witnessed each other experiences and how God was always present. Was it mere coincidence that they met and fostered a lifelong friendship? Over coffee one of those days they decided to put those great stories to paper and this book is what it grew to be. Faith and friendship carried them through love, loss and raising their families. 
Ever heard the saying that Gods timing is always perfect? Well Annie would have to agree, after being turned away by a bad-mannered bus driver.  Feeling  slighted she walk off  frustrated with the inconveniencing experience , only to be snapped into reality that a car crashed into that same bus a couple of streets away. Recognizing Gods mercies became more obvious in her life after that day.
For Rose she recognized Gods mercy when as a young woman she survived being attacked.  Her attacker suddenly fled her home in fear. Rose believes if not for Gods mercy, she would have been badly hurt. Thru their experiences they have learned that God was always there and how great He is.
Powerful, exciting short stories that will tug at your heart make you laugh but most importantly it will inspire you to take a step of faith and see Gods grace" />
