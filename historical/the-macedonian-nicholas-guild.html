  <title>The Macedonian - Nicholas Guild</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nicholas Guild&#39;s &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Macedonian &lt;/i&gt;is a gripping fictional account of the life of Philip of Macedon, the king who sired Alexander the Great and conquered an unprecedented number of ancient Greek city-states.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a cold, snow-swept night in the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon, a son is born to the king&#39;s principal wife. His mother hates him for being his father&#39;s child.  His father hardly notices him. With two elder brothers, obscurity seems his destiny.  The boy is sent off to be nursed by the chief steward&#39;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, in a moment of national crisis, when Macedon is on the verge of being torn apart, the prince raised by a servant finds himself proclaimed the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Philip, prince and king, the forgotten boy who rose to save his country and became a legend in his own lifetime. His extensive military conquests across the Greek peninsula would pave the way for expansion under his son, Alexander the Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
