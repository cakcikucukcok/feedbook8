  <title>Killer Instinct - Joseph Finder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jason Steadman is a thirty-year-old sales executive living in Boston and working for an electronics giant, a competitor to Sony and Panasonic. He&#39;s a witty, charismatic guy who&#39;s well liked at the office, but he lacks the &quot;killer instinct&quot; necessary to move up the corporate ladder. To the chagrin of his ambitious wife, it looks as if his career has hit a ceiling. Jason&#39;s been sidelined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all that will change one evening when Jason meets Kurt Semko, a former Special Forces officer just back from Iraq. Looking for a decent pitcher for the company softball team, Jason gets Kurt, who was once drafted by the majors, a job in Corporate Security. Soon, good things start to happen for Jason--and bad things start to happen to Jason&#39;s rivals. His career suddenly takes off. He&#39;s an overnight success. Only too late does Jason discover that his friend Kurt has been secretly paving his path to the top by the most &quot;efficient&quot;--and ruthless-- means available. After all, as Kurt says, &quot;Business is war, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Jason tries to put a stop to it, he finds that his new best friend has become the most dangerous enemy imaginable. And now it&#39;s far more than just his career that lies in the balance. A riveting tale of ambition, intrigue, and the price of success, &lt;i&gt;Killer Instinct&lt;/i&gt; is Joseph Finder at his best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;** &lt;i&gt;Pittsburgh Post Gazette&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
