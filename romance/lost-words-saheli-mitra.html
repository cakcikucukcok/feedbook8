  <title>Lost Words - Saheli Mitra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born to Bengali parents, Geet Nandi is forever lost in her world of scientific experiments, experiencing birth and death down scientific parameters. She and her brother Chitrak, enjoy boundless freedom appreciated by their bohemian mother, Shuvangi, who dies of cancer early in life. 
But she had never been in want of love, as her extended family of uncles, none of who shared the ties of the womb with her parents, had made her feel belonged. Handsome army man Veer uncle from Delhi and eccentric Deep uncle from Kolkata had been her idols. 
Veers NRI son Jai and Geet make a lovely couple back in USA. Every one seems happy when they decide to tie the knot. But as the wedding preparations take off, a bunch of old letters, hidden quietly for years, throw all the characters in a tizzy. The letters throw up a tale of love and lust, lost in the dark alleys of social patriarchy. Secrets, society and principles play havoc, slicing through apparently happy families. 
Is love just a chemical reaction, or is it bound by social compulsions? And can nameless relationships sustain the test of love?" />
