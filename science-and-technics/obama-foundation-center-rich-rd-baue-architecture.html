  <title>Obama Foundation Center - richärd+baue architecture</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Obama Presidential Center&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expanding opportunity in the global age, improving the health of our communities, protecting our children from the dangers of climate change, and looking beyond military force to promote peace, justice, and dignity throughout the world. Make real America&amp;rsquo;s founding promise, that we are all created equal and free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;THE WHY I &lt;em&gt;DESIGN PHILOSOPHY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We seek to promote no individual style; each building is built upon a conceptual framework, derived from the program and the response to the site. It is fundamental that each building speak to its purpose and internal processes in simple terms, yet aspire to an intrinsic symbolic concept. Architecture must raise the level of expectation and wonder, focusing on the experience of the occupant. Materials are chosen for their inherent integrity, natural beauty, and patina. Synthetic or continuously renewed surface erases the mark of time lacking a sense of permanence and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;THE HOW I &lt;em&gt;COMMITMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;rich&amp;auml;rd+bauer carefully balances the need for fit within the context and community fabric while providing an iconic public identity for each. The rich&amp;auml;rd+bauer team is uniquely qualified to translate the vision of the new Barack Obama Presidential Center into a state of the art interdisciplinary, interactive public library, research, and museum center. Recent new similar projects experience by the collective project team directly apply to the possibilities, opportunities and choices faced by you and your team on this project. Our team members have all worked on library, research, and community center projects together involving how to balance the needs of new modern themes and technology with a reverence to tradition of functional and innovative learning environments that support leading edge technologies and learning styles, flexible and adaptable design, and integrated systems for design and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;THE WHAT I &lt;em&gt;PROCESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our process fosters consensus building as well as shared authorship and ownership activities. At the end of the day, we want to understand all we can about what this building is, what it means, and how it engages its audience. From the very beginning, we will author a work-plan as a checklist of measurable accomplishments visited regularly with the team. If issues arise, they are addressed immediately by the parties until resolution is understood and achieved sustainability is a hallmark of our process and all of the buildings we&amp;rsquo;re featuring as a part of this book have either achieved LEED status or are in progress, the highest level of which is LEED Platinum. This process begins early in the design and we monitor our progress regularly. By informing the team, we assure that there aren&amp;rsquo;t any impediments to achieving the desired LEED level." />
