  <title>Baboon - Naja Marie Aidt, Denise Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Beginning in the middle of crisis, then accelerating through plots that grow stranger by the page, Naja Marie Aidt&amp;#8217;s stories have a feel all their own. Though they are built around the common themes of sex, love, desire, and gender, Aidt pushes them into her own desperate, frantic realm. In one, a whore shows up unannounced at a man&amp;#8217;s apartment, roosts in his living room, and then violently threatens him when he tries to make her leave. In another, a wife takes her husband to a city where it is women, not men, who are the dominant sex&amp;#151;but was it all a hallucination when she finds herself tied to a board and dragged back to his car? And in the unforgettable &amp;#147;Blackcurrant,&amp;#8221; two young women who have turned away from men and toward lesbianism abscond to a farm, where they discover that their neighbor&amp;#8217;s son is experimenting with his own kind of sexuality. The first book from the widely lauded Aidt to reach the English language, &lt;I&gt;Baboon&lt;/I&gt; delivers audacious writing that careens toward bizarre, yet utterly truthful, realizations.&lt;/div&gt;" />
