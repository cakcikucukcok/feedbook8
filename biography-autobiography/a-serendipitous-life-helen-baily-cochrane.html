  <title>A Serendipitous Life - Helen Baily Cochrane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The life of Helen Cochrane has been filled with many amazing stories, and she has recorded many of them in her autobiography.  From small-town girl to national ecclesiastical leader, Helen relates the exciting experiences of her life and presents them here in her incredible journey.  Beginning her life as a bankers daughter during the Great Depression, she  struggled for ordination and respect as a woman in one of the countrys largest denominations.  At the same time, she has interwoven the national, state, and regional events that shaped her life and the lives of her family members.  
	From Black Friday to the rough-and-tumble games with her brothers, World War II,  battles with hurricanes and floods, and her first kiss, to prejudices, miscarriages, an eye falling out of its socket, and becoming friends with celebrities, Helen relates her colorful life in hundreds of tales and anecdotes.  I can guarantee there is never a dull moment in this unique, fascinating story of a passionate, pioneering, peacemaking woman who felt and responded to Gods call on her life." />
