  <title>Caesar&#39;s Legion: The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar&#39;s Elite Tenth Legion and the Armies of Rome - Stephen Dando-Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A unique and splendidly researched story, following the trials and triumphs of Julius Caesar&#39;s Legio X-arguably the most famous legion of its day-from its activation to the slogging battle of Munda and from Thapsus, Caesar&#39;s tactical masterpiece, to the grim siege of the Jewish fortress of Masada. More than a mere unit account, it incorporates the history of Rome and the Roman army at the height of their power and gory glory. Many military historians consider Caesar&#39;s legions the world&#39;s most efficient infantry before the arrival of gunpowder. This book shows why. Written in readable, popular style, Caesar&#39;s Legion is a must for military buffs and anyone interested in Roman history at a critical point in European civilization.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-T. R. Fehrenbach, author of This Kind of War, Lone Star, and Comanches&lt;p&gt;Stephen Dando-Collins paints a vivid and definitive portrait of daily life in the Tenth Legion as he follows Caesar and his men along the blood-soaked fringes of the Empire. This unprecedented regimental history reveals countless previously unknown details about Roman military practices, Caesar&#39;s conduct as a commander and his relationships with officers and legionaries, and the daily routine and discipline of the Legion. From penetrating insights into the mind of history&#39;s greatest general to a grunt&#39;s-eye view of the gruesome realities of war in the Classical Age, this unique and riveting true account sets a new standard of exellence and detail to which all authors of ancient military history will now aspire." />
