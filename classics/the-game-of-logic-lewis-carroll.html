&lt;br /&gt;
The Game of Logic, described by Lewis Carroll--author of Alice in Wonderland--in 1887 consists of discussing the meaning of propositions like &amp;quot;Some fresh cakes are sweet,&amp;quot; and is an instructive introduction to the concepts of logic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The game takes place in a world divided into four quadrants. In the northwest quadrant, the cakes are fresh and sweet, in the northeast, they are fresh and not-sweet, in the southwest, they are not-fresh and sweet, and in the southeast, they are not-fresh and not-sweet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The game is played with four red coins and five gray coins. A red coin is used to indicate the presence of some (one or more) cakes in a sector, while a gray coin indicates that the sector is empty." />
