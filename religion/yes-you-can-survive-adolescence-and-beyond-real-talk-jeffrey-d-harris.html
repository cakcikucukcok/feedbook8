  <title>Yes, You Can Survive Adolescence and Beyond: Real Talk - Jeffrey D. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yes You Can Survive Adolescence and Beyond was inspired by Jeffrey Harris&#39; childhood and life long experience.  Growing up without knowing his biological father, reared in a financially challenged household, Mr. Harris makes no excuses of what he didn&#39;t have, but talks about how he achieved what he does have.  He learned the values of hardwork at an early age. Self-determination never left him although hard times challenged him. Reflecting on how he walked around with cardboard stuffed at the bottom of his shoes to replace their  worn soles, drug dealing and use,   and gang involvement, Mr. Harris knows that there is a much better life for everyone despite their challenges. The book captures such experiences of everyday people and prominent people we all know. His experience in the United States Army awakened him to his life&#39;s purpose.   Although those years were not his best, they were the years that fertilized the seed his grandfather planted within him to cultivate the man he is today.   This book is straight talk. It is nothing spectacular, but provocative, practical, profound and to the point.  His advice to young people is believable and achievable.  The book is trusting and real.  Now, you be the judge!" />
