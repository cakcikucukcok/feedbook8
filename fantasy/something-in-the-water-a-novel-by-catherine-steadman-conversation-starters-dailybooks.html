She was reaching a breakthrough in her career and was in love with Mark, an ambitious investment banker. Mark and Erin went on a honeymoon in the dreamy island of Bora Bora. Suddenly their dream vacation became a nightmare. When they went scuba diving, they found something in the water. They were faced with a choice: protect their secret or speak out about it. Either choice is dangerous and whatever they decide on would trigger a chain of disastrous events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
