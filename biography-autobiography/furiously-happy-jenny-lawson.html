  <title>Furiously Happy - Jenny Lawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt;, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jenny Lawson explores her lifelong battle with mental illness. A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a &lt;i&gt;terrible &lt;/i&gt;idea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But terrible ideas are what Jenny does best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jenny says&lt;i&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Some people might think that being &#39;furiously happy&#39; is just an excuse to be stupid and irresponsible and invite a herd of kangaroos over to your house without telling your husband first because you suspect he would say no since he&#39;s never particularly liked kangaroos. And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their house. Two is the limit. I speak from personal experience. My husband says that none is the new limit. I say he should have been clearer about that before I rented all those kangaroos.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Most of my favorite people are dangerously fucked-up but you&#39;d never guess because we&#39;ve learned to bare it so honestly that it becomes the new normal. Like John Hughes wrote in The Breakfast Club, &#39;We&#39;re all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it.&#39; Except go back and cross out the word &#39;hiding.&#39;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt; is about&lt;i&gt; &quot;taking those moments when things are fine and making them amazing, because those moments are what make us who we are, and they&#39;re the same moments we take into battle with us when our brains declare war on our very existence. It&#39;s the difference between &quot;surviving life&quot; and &quot;living life&quot;. It&#39;s the difference between &quot;taking a shower&quot; and &quot;teaching your monkey butler how to shampoo your hair.&quot; It&#39;s the difference between being &quot;sane&quot; and being &quot;furiously happy.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawson is beloved around the world for her inimitable humor and honesty, and in &lt;i&gt;Furiously Happy&lt;/i&gt;, she is at her snort-inducing funniest. This is a book about embracing everything that makes us who we are - the beautiful and the flawed - and then using it to find joy in fantastic and outrageous ways. Because as Jenny&#39;s mom says, &quot;Maybe &#39;crazy&#39; isn&#39;t so bad after all.&quot; Sometimes crazy is just right.&lt;/p&gt;" />
