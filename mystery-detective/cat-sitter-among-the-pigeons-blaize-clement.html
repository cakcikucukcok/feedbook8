  <title>Cat Sitter Among the Pigeons - Blaize Clement</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Blaize Clement has earned herself a legion of fans with the first five books in her pet-sitting mystery series. Now Blaize&#39;s beloved heroine, Dixie Hemingway, is back, and when Dixie&#39;s latest assignment turns dangerous, it&#39;s up to her to save the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixie, no relation to you-know-who, is helping an injured and cantankerous man take care of Cheddar, his orange shorthair cat. Soon Dixie finds herself totally smitten with the man&#39;s adorable infant great-granddaughter. But the baby&#39;s naive young mother has enough knowledge about certain powerful local big-mney honchos to send them to prison for life, and they are willing to do anything, even kill her baby, to shut her up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught in the turmoil caused by the grandfather&#39;s prickly pride, the granddaughter&#39;s misguided plans to regain her young husband&#39;s respect by telling the truth in court, and the ruthless determination of wealthy villains to preserve their ill-gotten millions, Dixie is the only person who can rescue the baby. And she has to do it without letting law-enforcement people know -- not even Lieutenant Guidry, with whom she has a new romantic relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Dixie have her claws sunk too deep to make it out of this one? Find out in book six of Blaize Clement&#39;s splendid series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
