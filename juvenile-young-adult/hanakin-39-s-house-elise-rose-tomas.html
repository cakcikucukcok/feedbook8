      <meta name="description" content="KinKin is happy to play alone in the vast grey Castle he calls his home. The Queen will feed him twice a day and then will leave him alone to play. The King he hardly sees at all ,unless he needs a new football.  He has so many toys to choose and far too may rooms to use. His stuff is scattered everywhere but KinKin really does not care. This place is his and his alone and he is free to run and roam. There is no one to interfere and KinKin is glad that he lives here.  However, his days alone will be no more as a stranger is knocking upon his door and things are about to change." />
