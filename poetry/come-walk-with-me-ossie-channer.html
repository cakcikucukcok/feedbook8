Blue Bird
Oh my blue bird flap your wings to the sounds of the wind turn
Your head to the early morning sun and open your beak and
sing to me
My sweet with open arms I will dance with you blue bird
Until my legs cant move any more
Blue bird then you can rap your wings around me
Blue bird let me feel the warmth of your feathers
Push your chest out baby and sing
I will dance just for you
Blue bird takes me to the mountain where the frosty mist
covered the leaves
And sing for me blue bird the nightingale
The sparrows and all their friends will all start singing and
dancing with us
Blue bird. We can all dance to the valley
To the side of the river
Into the garden where all the rose are slowly opening
To the sound of the wind
Sing baby sing blue bird.
Dream Lover . . .
The early morning sun glittered
On my bed room window
As if it was some kind of red diamond
That move with a feeling of intimacies
That could drive a man wild,
The color of the sun drag across the cream colored silk sheet
As if a painter has romantically painted the colors of the
rainbow all over my bed
That could only be love.
I know I was in heaven
As I slowly turn to take my angel into my arms
To my surprise she was gone
I run to the door shout out her name
Door to door to the living room
Where the bright glittering sun force her colorful light though
the widow shade.
On the coffee table was a note she left behind.
I fell asleep in your arms and yes I feel like a queen on the chest
of my lord
With our bodies rap around each others I was secured
Like an angel in heaven.
Then I was awaken by your soft voice calling some
one your angel
And it was not my name
So I take first flight out to a lonely place
Call hearth break hotel so long dream lover" />
