  <title>Avarom and the Red Queen - J. L. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By defeating three of the most dangerous thieves in the kingdom of Servitica, Avarom was elected to stay on as the personal bodyguard for its ruler, Queen Nakir.  With nowhere else to go, he accepted.  
Now war has been declared against Servitica and all her allies of the Great Lands from an unknown adversary. Already these mysterious enemies are moving murderously toward the very gates of Servitica!  War on a grand scale is imminent!   And just as preparations are to be made for this campaign, the Queen vanishes!  Chancellor Gorin, who now rules Servitica, has charged Avarom with murder and treason! 
With very little to go on and a lot at stake, Avarom and his appointed custodians must race against time to find those responsible for the abduction of the Queen. In order to do so they will face the flesh eating demons of Ecillia; the living monolith called the Miodrag; the merciless blade of Kazara, and the enigmatic necromancer known only as Yarum!  
Past deeds are brought to light!  
Centuries of linage revealed as the fate of the Great Lands if not the world rests solely in the hands of Avarom and The Red Queen!" />
