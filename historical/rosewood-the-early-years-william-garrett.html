  <title>Rosewood: the Early Years - William Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the day its grand foundation was laid, Rosewood Plantation was special. A cotton-producing farm, it seems to be just like neighboring plantations on the surfacebut it has a secret to protect. It is a place of swelling adventure, filled with brave gentlemen, beautiful Southern belles, and a visitor from beyond. The residents of Lindbergh, Tennessee, consider the plantation to be home to more than just memories and history, and most have a chilling story to share about Rosewood.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the plantation has known many owners, each one leaving his mark on the place. Each new generation has a new story to learn and to create, and each new person who lives there has a new experience. But throughout it all, the plantation itself endures, and this is its story.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Rosewood itself has its own personality and contribution to its own tale, and is in many ways its own character and story to tell. How much influence can a structure have on its story, its history, and its future? For one owner at least, the house has more power than might seem possible. Every owner had his own dreams for the place and the people who lived there, but William Clairbourne stood apart in his ambition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had he succeeded in his plans for Rosewood, it very well could have changed the outcome of the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;" />
