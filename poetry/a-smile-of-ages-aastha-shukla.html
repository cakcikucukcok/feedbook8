  <title>A Smile of Ages - Aastha Shukla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aastha Shukla, born on September 7, 1994 is a student living in India. She has a liberal style of writing and intends to relate to her readers. She wanders in her imagination, carrying the depth and innocence of her feelings. The literary and philosophical approach of the young poetess might change your ideas of age and sanity. Her inclination towards poetry and literature has ripened her mind beyond age and experiences. In most of her poems, she sounds solitary, yet expressive. The dream to reach out to more people and bring to them substance is her only effort by this soft cover. The book is your good companion if you believe in Love, Magic, Abstract, Insights, Solitude and The unseen. Her simple ideas about the little things we all ponder upon will reach to melodize your heart at once.
The author also writes in Hindi, with an inclination towards Urdu vocabulary.
The pen name Rida is an Urdu word and it stands for the act of being contented." />
