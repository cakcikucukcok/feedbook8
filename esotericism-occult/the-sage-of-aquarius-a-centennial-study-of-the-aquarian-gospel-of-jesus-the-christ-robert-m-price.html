  <title>The Sage of Aquarius: A Centennial Study of the Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ - Robert M. Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ by Levi Dowling is surely the most detailed, intricate, compelling and impressive of all the modern gospels written to update scripture and to reveal spiritual truth for a new era. Though it claims to be a channeled revelation, it is obvious that Leo (&amp;quot;Levi&amp;quot;) Dowling expended stupendous effort not only on content (with numerous fascinating tales, parables, and sayings) but also on form (the entire, massive work being set in iambic pentameter and hexameter). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Testament scholar Robert M. Price (Ph.D. in Systematic Theology; Ph.D. in New Testament, Drew University), having long been intrigued with the Dowling gospel, has undertaken to study it with the tools of modern biblical research. As with the Bible, the Aquarian Gospel yields new riches of understanding once one applies the methods that traditionalist believers most fear. For there are certainly believers in The Aquarian Gospel who are as stubbornly fundamentalist as any Baptist. Price&amp;#39;s book aims at opening up a wider vista of interpretation to these people as well as demonstrating to outsiders that the Aquarian Gospel deserves serious intention. He is friendly to the text under study and pays it due respect by scrutinizing it unflinchingly." />
