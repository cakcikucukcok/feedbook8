  <title>Through the Eyes of a Concerned Liberal - Earle F. Zeigler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;Through the Eyes of a Concerned Liberal&lt;/b&gt; argues that the socio-political position of liberalism is the only one that can get us back on course toward the now-vanishing &quot;enlightenment ideal&quot;. This was the vision of the &quot;founding fathers,&quot; looking to a time when all of the conditions of life--social, political, moral, and intellectual, as well as material--would be realized for everyone--the &quot;&lt;i&gt;American dream&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;  
&lt;P&gt;Taking a hard look at the present social-political situation in North America, Dr. Zeigler offers a self-evaluation test for the reader to determine his/her socio-political=political stance on a spectrum (from far right to far left). (Other &quot;tests&quot; serve to evaluate, respectively, both one&#39;s philosophy of life and/or religion and recreational quotient &quot;RQ&quot;.) The United States, the author asserts, simply does not appreciate that its current &quot;imperial&quot; status will be sorely tried in the 21st century. 
&lt;P&gt;The U.S.A. must now prove that its brand of capitalism and democracy, one that purports to offer a maximum of individual freedom within a democratic political system, is the best approach for the entire world to emulate. However, capitalism and ecology have become social forces on a collision course in this evolving cultural matrix. The individual citizen in this setting must be fully informed and must serve actively and responsibly to implement a &lt;i&gt;liberal&lt;/i&gt; agenda. 
&lt;P&gt;The author offers 49 short essays, columns, and self evaluation devices that reflect his position. In the final analysis, each person should choose a life purpose based on (1) a comprehensive philosophy of life, (2) a concurring, socio-political stance, and (3) a search for &quot;the good life&quot; in a hopefully free society." />
