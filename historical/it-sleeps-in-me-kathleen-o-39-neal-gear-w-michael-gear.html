  <title>It Sleeps in Me - Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear, W. Michael Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sora is the wise, young High Chieftess of the Black Falcon Nation. For many winters her heart belonged to her husband, Flint, a warrior from a neighboring clan. Flint truly loved Sora, and together they explored the world of passion and love. But Flint was very jealous and on more than one occasion beat men to death for merely casting a longing glance at Sora. Unable to live with his murderous rage, Flint packed up his things and moved back to his mother&#39;s clan, divorcing Sora and leaving her forever.&lt;br&gt;Remarried and fully devoted to her duties as the High Chieftess, Sora tries to bury her memories of Flint. But she is forcibly reminded of her lost love when, on the eve of war with a neighboring nation, when she is visited by Skinner, an old friend of Flint&#39;s. He brings word of Flint&#39;s death, but Sora notices something strange about Skinner; it is as if he carries a part of Flint&#39;s soul inside of him. When he starts revealing secrets that only Flint would know, and arousing her passion in ways only Flint had, Sora must figure out if this is merely the clever witchcraft of enemies who want to seize her power and destroy her nation or the spirit of her one and only true love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
