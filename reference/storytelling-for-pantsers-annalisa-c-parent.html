Hungry for a book that shows you how to write and revise your novel without an outline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover the secret sauce to help those of us seat-flyers get at least some grounding in what we do,&lt;br /&gt;
and to find and use a system in the chaos that is pantsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is intended to help those of us seat-flyers get at least some grounding in what we do, and to find and use a system in the chaos that is pantsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for you if you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are still on chapter one -&amp;nbsp;You should read this book if you have started a novel at least 68 times (the same novel) and only written the first chapter&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jump around -&amp;nbsp;You should read this book if you write chapter 1. And then chapter 5. And then chapter 2. etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write to Discover -&amp;nbsp;You should read this book if you need to write to discover your story. (&amp;ldquo;I just watch my characters and write down what they do.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get Lost in the Weeds -&amp;nbsp;You should read this book if you get lost in the weeds of writing and revision because portions of your novel are in&amp;nbsp;different phases of the writing process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feel Writing is Complicated -&amp;nbsp;You should read this book if you feel frustrated because &amp;ldquo;Dang it; writing&amp;rsquo;s hard enough. Why do I always have to&amp;nbsp;complicate it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wear Pants -&amp;nbsp;You should read this book if you think the cover of this book is cool, or wear pants. Because, hey, the cover is cool. So&amp;nbsp;are you, and so is this book. (Who says you can&amp;rsquo;t judge a book by it&amp;rsquo;s cover? Pshaw.)&lt;/li&gt;
