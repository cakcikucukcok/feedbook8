  <title>The Private History Of A Campaign That Failed - Mark Twain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written as a fictionalized account of Mark Twain’s own short-lived war experience, &quot;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot; is a satiric sketch of the American South at the onset of the American Civil War. The narrative follows a small group of young men—dubbed “the Marion Rangers”—as they stumble around the backwoods of Marion County, Missouri, on patrol for Yankee troops. After avoiding improbable attacks, failing to tame unruly horses, and imposing on farmers for their food and supplies, the ensemble is finally met with the sobering reality of war when a man is shot and killed. In true Twain style, &quot;The Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot; utilizes a comic and wryly humorous tone to strip the subject of war of heroism and romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the HarperPerennial Classics collection to build your digital library.&lt;/p&gt;" />
