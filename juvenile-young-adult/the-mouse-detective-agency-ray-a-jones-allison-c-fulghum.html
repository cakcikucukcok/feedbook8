  <title>The Mouse Detective Agency - Ray A. Jones, Allison C. Fulghum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mouseville is a unique town in which cats and owls dont chase mice and rats. In fact, cats, mice, foxes, owls, flying squirrels, and raccoons all live in harmony. However, one thing the animals have in common with the human populace is greed. Sometimes, even animals want something somebody else has, and some of them dont want to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the M&amp;C Detective Agency, owned by two mouse friends, Murray and Cathy. They take on the crooks of Mouseville and Rattown with confidence. Whether searching for stolen cheese or solving a bank robbery, the M&amp;C detectives always get their man, er, cat! A problem at the circus, a mystery at the baseball game, missing diamonds, and even a great train robbery cannot deter the mouse detectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sleuths drive a bright, yellow Mousemobile convertible. They are well known around town, especially to the chief of police, who often calls on them for help. The mouse detectives turn even the most challenging case into a bit of fun, and the celebration of success always takes the form of a picnic with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
