  <title>Small Is Ugly - Lab Chaudhuri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Small scale industry as a concept receives plenty of encouragement from the government and consequently from financial institutions - it has the potential of solving a large part of the unemployment problem besetting India and that too on a relatively low capital base. However, while there is full support for the same on paper, ground realities are starkly different. It needs to be understood that this is a segment of industry that needs differential treatment and far more hand-holding and support than its larger brethren. Unfortunately, this understanding seems to be lacking among the stakeholders and this been the major cause of the recurring problems afflicting the small entrepreneur. This book throws light on some of the issues afflicting this industry and areas where differential treatment is required. It also attempts to provide some possible solutions to these roadblocks which are hindering the entire segment from reaching its true potential." />
