  <title>Spirit Speaks. Are You Listening? - Vera Haldy-Regier, Valerie Croce Stiehl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Spirit Speaks. Are You Listening? follows the remarkable spiritual journey of a woman who knew from early childhood that she had a wise and true voice within that spoke to her from realms beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
Valerie Croce Stiehl outlines a life path every one of us can take if we long for inner peace and fulfillment. Hers are words to live by, road signs that can be followed readily no matter where you are on your path.&lt;/p&gt;
She tells of her early years as the suddenly single mother of five children; years of deprivation as she worked and went to school and struggled to put food on the table for her family; a later executive career in Manhattan; a transforming Near Death Experience as a result of a devastating car crash; and a decade living on an Indian reservation in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;
Those experiences forged a woman of towering strength, love and purposeguided surely by Spirit. It has been said of her by a spiritual teacher that she lives in a state of grace. This book confirms the fact.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enlightened, deeply spiritual, and most welcome, Spirit Speaks fulfills the seekers quest for truths both mundane and ethereal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Swami Bhimasen - Sivanda Ashram, India&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Valerie shares with us connectedness to the universe, not unlike Nicholas Black Elk, who, like her, left behind a comfortable world to seek truth and beauty in the natural spiritualism of Native American culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
