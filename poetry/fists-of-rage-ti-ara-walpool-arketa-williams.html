  <title>Fists of Rage - Ti’Ara Walpool, Arketa Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coauthors Arketa Williams and TiAra TI Walpool want to shine a light on abuse
that is often overlooked and very seldomly discussed. With this controversial
project, they are breaking their own silences. Having fallen prey to physical,
sexual, and emotional abuse, these two young women are ready to stop just existing
and start living. They no longer want to think of themselves as just another number.
Rightfully considering themselves victors, they want to give their readers the strength,
power, and knowledge to join them. Given the staggering statistics, if you are reading
this publication, you have likely been a victim of abuse, or you know someone who has.
Throughout this book, you may struggle, cry, laugh, fear, and be angry with them. Its
purpose is to call attention to the fact that the pain is real, and it happens more than
it is reported. But its time out for what goes on at home stays at home. By gaining
the courage to speak out against violence of all kinds, Ms. Williams and Ms. Walpool
are taking back the power over their lives. Now, using voices of truth, they are taking a
stand against Fists of Rage." />
