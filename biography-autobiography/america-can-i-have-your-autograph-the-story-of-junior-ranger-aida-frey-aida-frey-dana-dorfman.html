  <title>America, Can I Have Your Autograph?: The Story of Junior Ranger Aida Frey - Aida Frey, Dana Dorfman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You might think Junior Ranger Aida Frey is an ordinary girl from Chicago, but you&#39;d be wrong.   She&#39;s actually the sweetheart of national parks, and in this travel diary, she shares delightful stories from her fun-filled America&#39;s Two Hundred National Park Friendship Tour.   Aida takes you into caves, to old battlefields, and to the stuff of legends. She sweeps through the passages of time, throwing baseballs on a famous cornfield, climbing mountains, and exploring nature&#39;s nooks and crannies.   She also travels to the Sears Tower, the White House, the John Dillinger Museum, Michael Jackson&#39;s house, and Graceland. But it&#39;s her amazing interviews with national park rangers and superintendents, as well as her wonderful trip to Tupelo, Mississippi, that set off real fireworks.   So release the balloons, throw the confetti, and set out on a series of never-ending adventures with America, Can I Have Your Autograph?" />
