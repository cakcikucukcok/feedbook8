  <title>Little Brother - Cory Doctorow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marcus, a.k.a &quot;w1n5t0n,&quot; is only seventeen years old, but he figures he already knows how the system works-and how to work the system. Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school&#39;s intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they&#39;re mercilessly interrogated for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
