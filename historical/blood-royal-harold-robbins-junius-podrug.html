  <title>Blood Royal - Harold Robbins, Junius Podrug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales, was an ordinary young woman who was picked to be the future queen. Her wedding was a worldwide sensation. But she was deceived and betrayed before the honeymoon was over. Five months after a fairy tale wedding, she threw herself down a flight of stairs when she was pregnant with a future heir to the throne. Suicide attempts, illicit affairs, and paranoia that there were plots by the Royals to kill her became the norm as the fairy tale turned into a horror story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After suffering degradation and humiliation at the hands of her husband, the heir to the British throne, she shot him with one of his own antique pistols.&lt;br&gt;Paranoid that her own attorneys would deceive her, the princess reaches across the Atlantic to hire someone she knows for certain has no ties to the Crown. Marlowe James is an American trial lawyer. Running away from an abusive home, she supported herself by working as a waitress, rising to become a famous trial lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlowe James has been dubbed the &quot;burning bed lawyer&quot; by the news media because of her successful defense of women who killed their abusive husbands. And to top that, she was the accused in her first murder trial. Now she not only has to do battle in the Old Bailey with barristers loyal to the Crown, she has to come to grips with her own feelings about a woman who has been handed everything any woman would desire---and throws it all away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosive tale that will be exposed in the courtroom is one of jealous rage and unfulfilled desires, of sexual deceit by one of the most powerful men on earth---and the bloody revenge enacted by a woman scorned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
