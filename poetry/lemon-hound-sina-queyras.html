  <title>Lemon Hound - Sina Queyras</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;2007 Winner of the Pat Lowther Award and a Lambda Literary Award&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As meditative practices focus on the axis of breath, these poems focus on the moment of action, of thought, on the flux of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a poetry not of snapshots or collages but of long-exposed captures of the not-so-still lives of women. One sequence imagines Virginia Woolf&amp;#8217;s childhood; another unmakes her novel &lt;I&gt;The Waves&lt;/I&gt; by attempting to untangle its six overlapping narratives. Yet another, &amp;#145;On the Scent,&amp;#8217; makes us fl&amp;#226;neurs through the lives of a series of contemporary women, while &amp;#145;The River Is All Thumbs&amp;#8217; uses a palette of vibrant repetition to &amp;#145;paint&amp;#8217; a landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queyras&amp;#8217;s language &amp;#150; astute, insistent, languorous &amp;#150; repeats and echoes until it becomes hypnotic, chimerical, almost halluncinatory in its reflexivity. How lyrical can prose poetry be? How closely can it mimic painting? Sculpture? Film? How do we make a moment firm? These &amp;#145;postmodern,&amp;#8217; &amp;#145;postfeminist&amp;#8217; poems pulse between prose and poetry: the line, the line, they seem to ask, must it ever end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sina Queyras&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s latest collection of poetry, &lt;I&gt;Expressway&lt;/I&gt;, was nominated for a Governor General&#39;s Award and won Gold at the National Magazine Awards. Her previous collection &lt;I&gt;Lemon Hound&lt;/I&gt; won a Lambda Award and the Pat Lowther Award. She has taught creative writing at Rutgers, Haverford and Concordia University in Montreal where she now resides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
