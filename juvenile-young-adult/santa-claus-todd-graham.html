  <title>Santa Claus - Todd Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has been eight long years since eight-year-old Nicholas Claus was last seen disappearing in a flash with the worlds Christmas spirit stored safely within his very being. Now a strapping teenager, Nicholas struggles to find his way among his new brethren, the Sugar Plum Fairies, until one day a special reindeer and snowman bring Nick a treasured snow globe containing &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Song&lt;/i&gt;. This snow globe and song just may be the key to helping Nicholas discover his forgotten past and realize his ultimate destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the evil Ice Queen has enlisted the aid of Jack Frost and recruited him to join her and her troll warriors in destroying Christmas once and for all. As her power grows, people all over the lands must heed her demand to declare their Christmas beliefs and have them removed or suffer dire consequences. With the supreme strength of the Nutcracker war machine at her disposal, it seems that nothing can stop the Ice Queen from ending Christmas forever. That is, unless Nicholas Claus and his friends, including Prince Hero, the Kringles, and especially Nicholass big sister, Shelby, can stop the queen before its too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fantasy adventure tale is the follow-up to the story begun in &lt;i&gt;Santa Claus: The Spirit of Christmas&lt;/i&gt;. The tale is sure to delight readers of all ages as so much surrounding the greatest holiday icon ever is explained in joyous yuletide splendor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
