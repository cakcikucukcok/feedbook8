  <title>Just a Whisper Away (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Lauren Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A last-minute murder confession threw lawyer Abbie Winslow&#39;s world into a tailspin since she&#39;d believed her client innocent. Having discovered his guilt, she tried to keep him in prison. But when her plan didn&#39;t work, her crazed client went free…and vowed to punish her for her betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While in hiding, Abbie rekindled her passion for Jace Rogan, her first love and a man who deserved a woman without secrets. Though years had passed, their attraction still sizzled. And yet, just as Abbie felt safe in their budding relationship, her greatest fear came true–a murderer had tracked her down. She&#39;d finally found true love…but would she stay alive to enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;
