  <title>Climate Change and Global Warming - Exposed: Hidden Evidence, Disguised Plans - Andrew Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The weather is something which affects all of us, every day of our lives. It dictates our long and short-term plans. Though it has obvious and far reaching importance, most people don&#39;t know very much about the weather. These days, they don&#39;t take time to observe it and probably spend more time looking at a screen than they do looking at the sky. They don&#39;t really know why the weather seems to be changing. They are told by mainstream sources that anthropogenic (human) activity is having a negative effect on the climate. This book collects together, for the first time, a range of diverse data which proves that the whole issue of &quot;climate change&quot; is more complicated and challenging than almost all researchers into all these topics are willing to consider, examine or entertain. The book covers the global warming myth, geoengineering proposals, persistent jet trails, weather anomalies, weather modification, 9/11 and Agenda 21. Most of the people that need to read this book probably won&#39;t ever hear about it." />
