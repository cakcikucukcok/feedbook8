  <title>Tell It Like It Is.. - Sharon Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can you imagine a young, vibrant, spontaneous and intelligent child having the potential to develop into a successful, high-achieving adult?  Well, Alice experienced the opposite.  Being raped at a tender age, she blocked out the event; could not tell her parents, and chose to pretend that life is dandy, living a faade and creating the illusion that all is well.  Thus, with many unresolved emotions and thoughts which became debilitating beliefs, spilling over into devastating behaviours, Alice carried these into adulthood which caused much pain and suffering.  Many stumbling blocks were encountered, conflict and challenges she had to face and found herself at continuous cross roads and did not know which way to go.  Was a breakdown imminent?  
Three pertinent questions are raised which baffles people because they have not considered it before.  
	When are you the abused?
	When are you the abuser?
	When are you self-abusive?
After deep and honest introspect she courageously had to deal with her representational and belief systems, conditionings, habits and patterns.  How it leads to consequences and the impact it has on the self, family, friends, work and society at large. There is clarity!" />
