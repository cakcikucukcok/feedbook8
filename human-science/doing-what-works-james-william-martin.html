  <title>Doing What Works - James William Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will help you achieve goals based on your personal needs and values. It uses a simple and highly visual method called the 10-Step Goal Acceleration Process (GAP) to enable you to immediately apply its topics to relevant issues in your life. Key concepts build on those introduced in earlier chapters. Its other benefits include:
 Highly visual and easy to understand.
 Uses simple templates, so you can create a highly personalized improvement plan.
 Provides a logical road map for achieving goals.
 Goals can modified as your needs change.
 Encourages you to immediately begin applying key concepts in each chapter.
 Shows shortcuts for achieving goals to save time.
 Helps to more effectively resolve personal conflicts.
 Helps balance goals to avoid becoming stressed and frustrated.
 Provides a useful framework from which to organize your life&#39;s activities.
 Enables you to lead a more satisfying and successful life.
In summary, as you read this book, you will have a much clearer idea of which personal goals are important for improving your life. The 10-Step GAP process will also help you make sense of the complexity that surrounds your life. Complexity tends to inhibit personal success by distracting people from identifying and achieving the things important to them. You also learn how to create realistic plans for achieving important goals.  Don&#39;t be surprised if, at the end of the book, your final goals are different from the ones earlier ones. This approach for achieving personal goals will help you lead a more productive life. This is what successful people do differently!" />
