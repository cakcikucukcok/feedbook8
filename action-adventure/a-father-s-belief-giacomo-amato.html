  <title>A Father’S Belief - Giacomo Amato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nino Lenos family was the first generation that immigrated to America for the American dream. He was a Sicilian fisherman by trade.
On December 23, 1965, they went and lived in Red Hook section of Brooklyn, New York, where most of the Sicilian fishermen immigrants came to live and work in the navy yards docks. Nino, a man with principles and honor, and his son, Gino, both stood firm against all challenges in the new land of America. In 1966, Gino, at the age of twelve, entered the junior high school in Brooklyn. He had to deal with a multitude of issues: not knowing how to speak English and being bullied by kids from other ethnicities. He daily got into fights against bullies. Different ethnic street gangs and groups were going to that school. Gino never finished junior high school. Nino moved his family to Glendale, Queens, New York, and opened a pizza store for a better life for his family. There Nino found white Irish, Germans, street gangs, and the American mafia. Gino worked in the familys pizzeria, met Maria, and fell in love. He later got Maria pregnant, and they got married. After that, Gino began to have a conflict with Marias uncle, Fat Joe Massa, an American gangster. Years later, Joe moved up to become the boss of the Bonanno crime family. Gino overcomes treachery and deceit from this so-called American mafia uncle who is only related to him through his marriage with Maria. Gino survived getting two gunshot wounds that nearly stole his life as his wife Maria was due in August to give birth to their first baby! Gino believed in his fathers principles and honor." />
