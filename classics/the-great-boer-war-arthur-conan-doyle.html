  <title>The Great Boer War -  Arthur Conan Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Great Boer War is a non-fiction work on the Boer War by Arthur Conan Doyle and first published in 1900.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the course of the war some sixteen Editions of this work have appeared, each of which was, I hope, a little more full and accurate than that which preceded it. I may fairly claim, however, that the absolute mistakes made have been few in number, and that I have never had occasion to reverse, and seldom to modify, the judgments which I have formed. In this final edition the early text has been carefully revised and all fresh available knowledge has been added within the limits of a single volume narrative.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of the various episodes in the latter half of the war it is impossible to say that the material is available for a complete and final chronicle. By the aid, however, of the official dispatches, of the newspapers, and of many private letters, I have done my best to give an intelligible and accurate account of the matter." />
