  <title>Dosomething Think First - Lamon Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lamon Lindsay and Keith Hudson have come up with solutions to help kids deal with peer pressure. Teaching them at an early age how to approach lifes problems, make decisions and stand by them. Showing them how to become leaders instead of followers. Convincing them that listening to their parents comes before listening to the streets. Kids are not born with negative behavior.  They learn negative behavior from peers, the streets and in our schools. Schools are supposed to be a place of learning, so we might as well teach them properly.
This is what the book Dosomething Think First does. How can our kids deal with peer pressure when theyve never been taught how? Now with the first and the only book of its kind theres help, and a solution for our kids. If we dont start a change now it will only get worse." />
