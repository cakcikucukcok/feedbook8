  <title>Learning to Dance in the Rain - Brian McDermott, Lori McDermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a tragic car accident took the life of our twenty-one year old daughter, Maia, we began a journey that has been paradoxically the most heart-wrenching and spiritually uplifting period of our lives. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learning to Dance in the Rain chronicles the first year of this journey. Through pain and despair to renewed energy and spiritual discovery, we write about the many ways in which we are finding strength and inspiration to carry on. With help from family and friends, a variety of religious/spiritual traditions, encounters with the natural world, and, most profoundly, continued connection with our beloved daughter, we are learning that death is as much a beginning as it is an end and that pain can be a catalyst for personal &amp; spiritual growth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is our greatest hope that sharing our story in this way will help others find strength to face the storms that come their way and live their lives with greater awareness.&lt;br /&gt;
