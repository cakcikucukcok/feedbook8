  <title>Water Line - Patrice Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Authors tell stories for many reasons. One of the reasons for telling this story is to specifically connect with those who shared the same experience. Another reason for writing this book is to provide another experience of reference for the topic. This is just one story in the amid hundreds of other stories that could also be told. The final reason for telling this story is to leave an example or a blueprint for future generations of my family to know the strength and courage of those who came before them. I want my children to teach their children and their childrens children how to manage life through difficult situations and circumstances. I want this story to be an example for one of my favorite words, endure. 
Hurricane Katrina was one of the most destructive hurricanes in recent history. Its economic loss was well into the billions during the first week. Hurricane Katrina started as a depression, then tropical storm, and in days, developed into an intimidating category 4 and 5 hurricane. Lives were heavily impacted and changed in New Orleans, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Gulfport, Mississippi, as the massive hurricane brought heavy winds, rains, and more than twenty feet of storm surge. 
This book is not intended to dwell or wallow in the past. It is meant to review and remember what happened in order to celebrate the victory of moving through and moving past a tragedy. Ive learned in life that we cant be so quick to forget overwhelming or difficult life changes without learning the lessons from them. The truth is that life happens, and we must be willing to deal with, accept, confront, plan, solve, and move forward when lifes most unexpected twists and turns occur. This book is also not meant to become deeply involved in the political issues of Hurricane Katrina. The politics have already played out and are recorded in history. Water Line is simply the story of my familys journey before, during, and after one of lifes roughest moments while also recognizing the different experiences and levels of loss caused by one giant hurricane named Katrina." />
