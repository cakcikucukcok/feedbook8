  <title>How to Die and Live to Tell About It - Becky Bartness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After fourteen years of practice in Chicago, attorney Kate Williams relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, to get a saner lifestyle by cutting down on her hours and developing a social life. A year and a half later, she owns her own law firm in a converted cottage in downtown Phoenix and is a criminal defense attorney that employs a staff of three, a staff that keeps very busy.&lt;p&gt;
Kate, her coworkers, and friends are off and running again when she befriends a tree climbing, alien-watching man living in the backyard of her house-to-be, and she is kidnapped by aliens. Confusion and levity ensue when the CIA, Homeland Security, the US Armed Services, the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office, the Phoenix Police Department, and Kates real estate agent join in the search to find Kate.&lt;p&gt;
Matters are further complicated when Kates mother makes a surprise visit, and Kate and her friends are confronted by their most dangerous foe yet." />
