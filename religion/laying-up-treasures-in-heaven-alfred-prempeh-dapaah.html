  <title>Laying up Treasures in Heaven - Alfred Prempeh-Dapaah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a child of God and a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven, do you know
how you are connected to heaven on as far as your daily life is concerned?
Moreover, did you know that you have a heavenly account where you can
lay up treasures for yourself? Our Lord Jesus Christ revealed it to us when
he said; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
Where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
And where thieves do not break through nor steal
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also
Matthew 6:20-21 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
And how do we lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven  and how do we
tap into this heavenly account to make use of these treasures on earth? The
treasures we lay up for ourselves in heaven are not only to be enjoyed after
we leave this earth and go be with the Lord. The enjoyment of our heavenly
treasures begins right here on earth as it is the Fathers will for us in Christ.
This book reveals not only how to lay up the treasures; it also reveals how to
access the treasures as well in order to have your needs met according to the
riches of the Fathers glory in Christ Jesus. A must read for every kingdom
citizen on earth." />
