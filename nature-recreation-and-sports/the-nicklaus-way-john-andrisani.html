  <title>The Nicklaus Way - John Andrisani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jack Nicklaus set a record for most career victories in major championships, capturing a total of eighteen between 1962 and 1986, including six Masters wins. In 1988 &lt;em&gt;Golf&lt;/em&gt; Magazine named the &quot;Golden Bear&quot; Golfer of the Century, recognizing his exceptional swing and shot-making game, his strength as a golf ambassador, and his contributions to the game, including ushering in power-hitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Nicklaus Way,&lt;/em&gt; acclaimed golf writer John Andrisani analyzes how Nicklaus created such a powerful swing and developed near perfect shot selection. Andrisani also reveals the secrets to Nicklaus&#39;s mental and course-management games, and shows golfers how to prepare thoroughly for a round of golf -- Nicklaus style. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     What makes this book unique is that Andrisani goes far beyond the fundamentals of the setup and swing that Nicklaus learned from teacher Jack Grout and that enabled him to win so many major championships. Taking the instructional analysis process to the next level, Andrisani identifies for the first time subtle technical points of Nicklaus&#39;s swing that are not talked about in any of his instructional books or videos, as well as some new swing fundamentals Nicklaus learned from other top teachers such as Rick Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Nicklaus Way,&lt;/em&gt; Andrisani also looks at Nicklaus&#39;s tee-to-green game, sharing with golfers the ins and outs of this great golfer&#39;s uncanny shot-making game. The instruction is easy to follow, so golfers will have no excuse for not being able to hit everything from a power fade drive to a biting short iron to a long putt. &lt;/p&gt;" />
