  <title>The Kids in Mrs. Hildebrand&#39;s Class - Linda Dallmann, Diana Schuppel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A typical first grade class loves learning and their teacher, Mrs. Hildebrand. Then they discover she is very ill with cancer. They find ways to support her through surgery and lengthy treatment. She finds comfort and strength in their openness and genuine caring. She gains much from the experience. During the school year the children learn not only math and reading but what helping, humor and hugs can contribute to the healing process. This book can be a jumping off point for discussion when a student or students in a class or school encounter a similar situation.
&lt;p&gt;
This story was created while the author awaited a chemo treatment. It grew and developed into a book during her first five years of surviving cancer. As her students reached out and helped her get through a difficult time, she wanted to share the same possibility with other teachers, parents and children. This is a subject that touches nearly every one of us. It is important to help the children understand cancer as well." />
