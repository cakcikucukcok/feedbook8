  <title>The Origin of the Milky Way and Other Living Stories of the Cherokee - Barbara R. Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cherokee people have lived in the Great Smoky Mountains for thousands of years. During all this time, they have told stories to each other to explain how things came to be, to pass on lessons about life, and to describe the mountains, animals, plants, and spirits around them. &lt;i&gt;The Origin of the Milky Way and Other Living Stories of the Cherokee&lt;/i&gt; collects 27 stories that are great for kids and are still being told by storytellers today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented by members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in their own words, the stories appear in free-verse form, like poems on the page, so that if you read them aloud, you can hear the rhythm of the stories as they were originally told. Barbara R. Duncan provides a helpful introduction that describes Cherokee people&#39;s past and present ways of life and their storytelling traditions. The book also includes a glossary of key words from the stories, suggestions for further reading, and notes on the storytellers. For young readers, for parents to read aloud to young listeners, and for teachers and libraries, &lt;i&gt;The Origin of the Milky Way&lt;/i&gt; provides an excellent introduction to Cherokee culture. (For readers age 9 and up.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storytellers:&lt;br/&gt;Davy Arch&lt;br/&gt;Robert Bushyhead&lt;br/&gt;Edna Chekelelee&lt;br/&gt;Marie Junaluska&lt;br/&gt;Kathi Littlejohn&lt;br/&gt;Freeman Owle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
