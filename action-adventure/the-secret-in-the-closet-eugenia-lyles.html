  <title>The Secret in the Closet - Eugenia Lyles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story written by an eighty-eight-year-old writer who loved the old farm where her grandfather lived and where she spent many happy days as a child while growing up. It is a fiction story about people that the writer put on the farm in her imagination and has no relation to anyone or anything that has ever happened on the farm or anywhere else in the writers life. In the story, Eve goes back to the farm to find that things there have drastically changed. And so she returns to find love, adventure, and danger. It is a story about childhood adventures, growing up on the farm, and life after leaving and returning to find strange and unexplained things that are going on at the farm. She runs into hidden danger and makes plans to find out what happened to her Uncle Ben and to protect her Aunt Edna from the danger she senses is there on the farm. The writer wrote the story while she spent several days alone recovering from an illness. This story came to her while she was thinking about the old farm and those who lived there many years ago. The farm was so important to her, but the older family members have all passed away and most of the farm has been broken up and sold off to others. The only family members left are grandchildren and their families. Today, the old home has been partially torn down, but the farm is a real place and a small part is still there. The writers children are growing old and have no interest in the farm, so everything will soon pass away. The drawings, as well as all of the writing, were done by the author. She hopes others will enjoy an imaginary trip back to the old farm while reading this book and have a little excitement and adventure while being there. You will probably love seeing Eves old homestead cottage and attending a Christmas wedding while reading this book." />
