          &lt;strong&gt;HE WAS A SECRET AGENT WITH SPECIAL TRAINING…AND SHE WAS AT HIS MERCY &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lila Monroe&#39;s ordinary world was shattered in an instant, when she became an unwitting witness to murder. If not for devastatingly handsome undercover agent Justin Vidal–code name: Lone Wolf–she&#39;d already be dead. Now the only way to remain alive was to return to the scene of the crime and put her much-guarded trust in this mysterious stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before long Lila&#39;s attraction to her newly appointed protector had turned her plain-Jane existence on its head. Justin Vidal may have had an arsenal at his disposal and was well-equipped to handle any situation…but did that include falling for the girl next door?&lt;/p&gt;
