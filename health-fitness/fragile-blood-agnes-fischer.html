  <title>Fragile Blood - Agnes Fischer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Others thought she had everything a woman could want, an adoring husband, two wonderful children and a life many would be envious of, other than Agnes.  This is a novel, based on a true story, about an American nurse who leaves her native Oregon and starts up a new life in Freiburg with her German husband.  Early on in her marriage she realizes that her relationship with the young physicist-teacher is deteriorating.  She doesn&#39;t love him anymore, yet is reluctant to admit it.  What is she to do?  The dilemma is a common one.  The emancipated, loving and direct manner in which she finally approaches separation and continues on with her life is all but common.  Her pursuit?  She wants to find her soul mate, and what a surprise it is when she does.  Her life is turned upside down, and in more ways than one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	This is a book for any responsible bumbler or stumbler, male or female, who is equipped with a loving heart and an open soul and, who has decided to live life according to intuition, even though it can be scary sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
