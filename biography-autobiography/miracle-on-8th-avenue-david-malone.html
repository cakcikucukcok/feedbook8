  <title>Miracle on 8Th Avenue - David Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Retired Fort Worth Police Lieutenant David Malone&#39;s gripping memoir spans his twenty-year career.  With searing candor and sparkling insight, he deftly illuminates many gritty and inspiring memories.  Following the shooting of his fellow officer, who dies in Malone&#39;s squad car speeding to the hospital, he begins a downward slide.  He sinks into the abyss of depression and post traumatic stress, from which there seems no escape.  As  the years pass, Malone faces more trauma and has to shoot a man in self defense.  Finally, a family emergency brings him to a hospital on 8th Avenue, where he faces his greatest crossroad.  His life is forever changed.  This is a book of hope in the midst of hopelessness.  The book ends with Malone speaking to the people of Sydney at the 2000 Summer Olympics." />
