  <title>One-Pennyworth and the Butterfields Part One Children of the Streets Part Two A Boy Called Dreamtime - Gordon Ferguson Mackenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year is eighteen-ten, a brother and sister live in a workhouse in the City of York, England. Sam and April Butterfield are orphans. One night they&#39;re forced to leave the workhouse and make their own way in the world. In despair they wander the streets of York. Their lives changed when meeting a man who gives the impression of being wealthy. But it turns out the man is not what he portrayed himself to be. Shortly after that they meet a new friend. Like them, he lives on the streets and begs for money. He teaches Sam and April how to beg, so they can buy food. What lies in front of them they could not have imagined? Good and Bad adventures. They shall meet other friends, and they&#39;ll meet people they would not want as friends. But they will make a friend of an Aboriginal, a native of New South Wales: a boy called Dreamtime." />
