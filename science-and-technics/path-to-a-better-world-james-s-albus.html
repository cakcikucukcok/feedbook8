  <title>Path to a Better World - James S. Albus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is it really possible to live in a world without deprivation or economic strife, but instead with peace, prosperity, and better opportunities? &lt;i&gt;Path to a Better World&lt;/i&gt; proposes a practical plan that provides the means to make this dream a realityand all before the end of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Albus, an engineer, neuroscientist, and international expert in robotics and intelligent systems, begins by sharing his vision of an ideal world and contrasts that with the current reality.  After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the cur-rent free market capitalist system, Albus suggests an improved version of capitalization that has the potential to broaden the ownership of capital and stimulate significant economic growth. Included is a review of our nations technical progress to date and a proposal that encourages future technological advances that possess the capabilities to propel the country into an unprecedented era of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Path to a Better World&lt;/i&gt; is a well-researched, informative guidebook that allows Americans to imagine a life under a new form of capitalism that has the potential to offer the people of this great nation domestic tranquility, economic justice, and the pursuit of happiness for not only ourselves, but also our posterity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
