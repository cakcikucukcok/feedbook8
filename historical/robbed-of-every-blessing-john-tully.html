  <title>Robbed of Every Blessing - John Tully</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ireland, early 1800s. The Napoleonic Wars have ended, leaving an already disjointed country in peril. Maurice O&#39;Dwyer, a young Irishman, considers the lifeless body of an English tithe-collector slain under a rain-filled sky. From that moment it seems his fate is sealed: he and his young simpleton brother, Padraig, are exiled to Australia, &lt;i&gt;An Astr치il&lt;/i&gt;, to the convict-filled island of Van Diemen&#39;s Land - leaving behind his love, his land, and his liberty. However, in the bush Maurice discovers that there are allies in the most unlikely of places.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the critics said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;With the passion of an activist and the ear of a poet, John Tully constructs his novel out of the differing perspectives of the colonial project, weaving Irish lives and English lives, black experiences and white experiences into a dense tapestry of oppression and the many little resistances it fostered. This is an account of settlement in all its complexity, a multilayered book written with a deep sympathy for ordinary people coping with the collision of very different worlds. It&#39;s a text built from parallels, echoes and resonances, a much-needed excavation of a past that still haunts us.&amp;quot; - Jeff Sparrow, co-author of &lt;i&gt;Radical Melbourne: A Secret History&lt;/i&gt;" />
