  <title>Cheyenne Wife (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) (Colorado Confidential, Book 8) - Judith Stacy</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;ABANDONED, ALONE, PENNILESS&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Lily St. Claire buried her father along the Santa Fe Trail her life of privilege and ease had ended. Her future had loomed ahead of her, empty and unknowable until North Walker–half-Cheyenne and all man–bargained for her with horses and hope for brighter days for his people, his family, his heart!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;North Walker personified the rugged frontier that spawned him. Elegant, refined Lily St. Claire belonged to a different world–but she was perfect for his plan to bring their worlds together. She would teach his sister Eastern manners and then she would be free to go. But in his heart he was beginning to hope that Lily would never leave.&lt;/p&gt;
