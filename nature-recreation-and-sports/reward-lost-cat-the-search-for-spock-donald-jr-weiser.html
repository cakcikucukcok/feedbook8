  <title>Reward, Lost Cat, The Search for Spock - Donald Jr. Weiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story where the main characters are feline. There are some humans too. It is a story of cat love and loss. It is also a story of two humans finding each other and of human love and bonding. My name is Don Weiser. I had three cats: Jones (who is all black with green eyes and is going on 21 years of age), Spock (who is an Abyssinian and is presently lost), and Sam (who is a huge orange tabby who was a stray). I lived in Albany, NY for 17 years and worked for the Department of Social Services. My wife Beth lives in North Carolina and had three cats: Smokey (who is a lovely lion like gray tabby with the largest head I have ever seen), Maggie (who was a solid black cat with gold eyes), and Rosy (who is also a solid black cat with gold eyes and who is Maggie&amp;#39;s daughter). Beth and I are now married (8/90) and live in North Carolina with our six cats. Maggie is dead, Spock is lost, and Junior (the youngster cat who is a tabby) now lives with us. These are the main characters and the story is about how we all came to live together in North Carolina. I hope you find it interesting. It may make you cry, I hope it makes you laugh too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My book is meant to help anyone whose pet is lost. What to do, what steps to take before your pet is lost to help ensure that it doesn&amp;#39;t get lost and to make recovery easier. If it does become lost, what to do in the first hours, first days, first weeks, and long term up to how to deal with the possibility of never finding your pet." />
