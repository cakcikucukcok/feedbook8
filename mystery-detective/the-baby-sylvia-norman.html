  <title>The Baby - Sylvia Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Patricia and William cant wait to have children, but as soon as she gives birth, things seem to change. First, although she doesnt remember it, Patricia apparently tried to commit suicide in the hospital room. The doctors write it off as postpartum depression, but Patricia has the oddest feeling her baby, Bernard, had something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William tries to be supportive of his recovering wife. He is careful and loving with their son, but she seems almost afraid of little Bernard. She doesnt treat him as a mother wouldwith love, compassion, and patience. To Patricia, Bernard is some kind of monster, and sometimes, she swears he looks like an old man  and talks like one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Bernard the evil creature she suspects, or is the horror just part of Patricias twisted imagination? William fears for his family, but hes not sure where to turn. He hates to think his wife is mad, yet her behavior gives him little choice. Patricia, however, feels she has a purpose: to destroy the child she brought into the world before he hurts others, William included.&lt;/p&gt;" />
