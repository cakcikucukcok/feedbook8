  <title>Rain - Don Paterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this, his first volume of original verse since the award-winning &lt;i&gt;Landing Light&lt;/i&gt;, Don Paterson is found writing at his most memorable and direct. In an assembly of masterful lyrics and monologues, he conjures a series of fables and charms that serve both to expose us to the unsettling forces within the world and to offer some protection against them. Whether outwardly elemental in their address or more personal in their direction, these poems--addressed to the rain and the sea, to his young sons or beloved friends--never shy from their inquiry into truth and lie, embracing everything in scope from the rangy narrative to the tiny renku. &lt;i&gt;Rain&lt;/i&gt;, which includes the winner of this year&#39;s Forward Prize for the Best Individual Poem and an extended elegy for the poet Michael Donaghy, is Paterson&#39;s most intimate and manifest collection to date.&lt;/p&gt;" />
