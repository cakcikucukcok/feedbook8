  <title>Disappearance at Mount Sinai - Jim Musgrave, Ellen Bernabei, X Graphicz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Top 100 Amazon Downloaded Mystery Second Mystery in the Best-Selling Pat O&#39;Malley Historical Steampunk series It&#39;s 1866 in New York City. Civil War Vet and Detective Pat O&#39;Malley&#39;s biggest case returns him to the deep, dark South to search for the kidnapped wealthiest inventor and entrepreneur in America. But the widening gyre of anti-Semitism and racism pulls him down into the pit of hell itself. Disguised as an Oxford England Professor, O&#39;Malley infiltrates the anti-Semites&#39; group and travels with his partners, Becky Charming and his father, Robert, down to a Collierville, Tennessee mansion.  Why 8,000+ Readers Have This Book This is an historical mystery that pushes the envelope with a worldwide eugenics conspiracy. It has a mystical element that includes Jewish folklore. Pat O&#39;Malley is an interesting and compelling sleuth. The historical characters used are accurate and relevant. Musgrave brings the 1860s in New York City to life in his mysteries. ??? This was a Featured Summer Read in the Jewish Daily Forward At the crux of this case are a Jewish father and his five-year-old son, Seth. They have developed a unique bond that relies on Jewish folklore and a belief that they are Mazikeen, half-angel and half-human, born from the loins of Adam&#39;s strange female cohorts during the 130 years he was banished from the Garden. Will O&#39;Malley find Dr. Mergenthaler before it&#39;s too late? What does this world-wide eugenics group have planned for the mongrel races? Read Jim Musgrave&#39;s Disappearance at Mount Sinai, the second mystery in the series of Pat O&#39;Malley Mini-Mysteries.  ??? Critical Acclaim for Disappearance at Mount Sinai &quot;Musgrave writes with intuitive insight into the prejudice of man&#39;s bigotry and greed, driven by ambition, and lust for power. He skillfully incorporates engaging dialogue, intriguing mystery, and fast-moving action to keep the reader in suspense right up to an intense dramatic unexpected conclusion.  Disappearance at Mount Sinai ensures author Jim Musgrave a growing fan base eagerly anticipating another sequel in the Pat O&#39;Malley Historical Mystery Series.&quot; Richard Blake, Blog Critics  &quot;Jim Musgrave is an award-winning author and it&#39;s easy to see why. The characters are well-developed and feel authentic; he captures the essence of America&#39;s reconstructive era perfectly and the pace of the story is steady. The mystery is complex and dramatic without being far-fetched or cliché. Musgrave even nailed the dialogue and interactions between such strongly divided cultures. The conclusion, just like the rest of the book, does not disappoint. Disappearance at Mount Sinai is absolutely a mystery worth reading.&quot; Ashley LaMar, Closed the Cover Book Reviews" />
