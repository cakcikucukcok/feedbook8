Your life is your fairy-tale story. You can make it happen as you will learn the MAGICAL module, which is the following:
Momentum
This is about how to connect with your inner power, love yourself, or write your own life and make it happen. This is the chapter where all our bad or good experiences happen; and if we are able to connect with our soul, inner self, God, or whatever you call it, you can see the magic of the moment and how blessed you are and how can you use your magic to create more magic around you. But if you cannot connect, then ask for help as you will be ending up going in circle and not moving on to next chapter of your life. Open your heart and mind to the universe so you can get unlimited information back to you, and you will be the master of your life how to live it. 
Acceptance
Learn to accept where you are in order to allow yourself to find positives on your situation, and raise your awareness on negatives in order to have clear vision of how you want to spend each moment and how you want your future to be. 
Goal
To understand who you are at the present and to be conscious of the choices you make, have a goal. Dream your wishes, visualize your dreams, and break them in small goals.
Inspiration
Dont forget to pause and notice the amazing things around us so you can get inspired from anything that is surrounded you, bad or good things. You still will have something to spark your inspiration and fire your creativity. 
Commitment
Be a good listener to your inner guidance, nature, and all your senses and trust the universe. Give time and flow with time by being spontaneous in order to understand when the time is right to do what you need to do. 
Affirmation
Tell yourself how good you are and what amazing things you are doing and what great abilities you have to fulfill your purpose.
Love
Love yourself and everything on this earth to attract the love energy that leads to you living in a magical world. Love is the medicine of life and the place where you get your answers" />
