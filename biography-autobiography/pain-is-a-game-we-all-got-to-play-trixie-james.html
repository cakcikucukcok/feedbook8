Trixie is one of the few, who was able to penetrate and move up the ladder, but the journey wasn&#39;t easy, because Trixie from the beginning was set up to fail, with a mother who loved her but had difficulty putting Trixie&#39;s needs above her own, a father who constantly abandoned her because he was a dead beat, her mother&#39;s family except for two aunts who resented her because they felt she was given everything, and her father&#39;s family who except for an uncle and great uncle acted as if she didn&#39;t exist." />
