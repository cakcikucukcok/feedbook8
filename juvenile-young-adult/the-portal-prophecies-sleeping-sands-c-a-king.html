  <title>The Portal Prophecies: Sleeping Sands - C. A. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It’s the final meeting of the camp before Willow and her friends find themselves whisked away to different schools hidden all over the main world. When Cassandrhea Tibbins interrupts, changes in plans are set in motion. With ‘The Empowered’ newspaper, run by the Quidnunks, continuing to pipe out damaging articles about Willow, there is no choice but to hide her from everyone. Never has she felt so isolated and helpless. It will take all of Willow’s strength to muster enough courage to face old and new enemies without the support of her allies. 
This fourth book of the Portal Prophecies series, delves deep into the understanding of magic and self-discovery. The plot continues to twist and turn as Cornelius’ ideas dive further into madness. Will Willow be able to handle this new pressure of hiding everything about herself from assassins, reporters, and new enemies or will she end up on the run from everyone? Will she be able to figure out the meaning of the latest prophecy alone?" />
