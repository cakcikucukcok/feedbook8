  <title>Get on the Journey - David Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is Get On The Journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I felt led to start writing mens devotions. They were primarily written for JourneyMen, men on a journey and walking with Christ. I soon found out that my devotions were not only being read by JourneyMen but also by women on the journey. Daily and manly activities end up being themes for devotion. Gods Word can be applied to my life, and in turn to your life, through these devotions. Devotion life topics include fishing, washing the car, cleaning the pool, watching television, Peyton Manning being released, working, sleeping, winning, losing, granite shopping, etc. Each devotional also contains probing questions that can be used for self-examination or for small group study. Get On The Journey contains fifty-two devotions that recap a year of my life and writing but can be read and explored on your journey at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;David Smith, Journeymen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you get on the journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through trials and temptations God will strengthen our faith as we journey in the race of life. It is here I find Davids devotionals an inspiration for each one of us who gather together in the name of Christ.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;David has a special talent for reflecting lifes circumstances as a tool to help us all join in the race together. Sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we cry. As you read Davids devotionals, meditate on your own life circumstances. Consider how God is shaping and molding you to be a JourneyMana man on a journey in life with Jesus as his Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
