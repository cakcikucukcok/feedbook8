  <title>Handbook for Fairy Godmothers - Diana Spirithawk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is truly a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; handbook on the art and practice of creating more love inside of ourselves and how to share from that place of loving into the world. It is filled with techniques, stories and motivation to that end and to happier, healthier, more loving lives. Her personal stories demonstrate the power of love, in all its many expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her &amp;ldquo;big picture&amp;rdquo; is to attract a global community whereby inner and outer activities of kindness, caring, sharing, peace, love and joy are the new state of the world. She gives historic and scientific studies to support the idea that &amp;ldquo;now is the time&amp;rdquo; to make the shift into the next millennium. Her stories are inspirational, heartfelt, sometimes poignant, embracing a deeper, more inclusive humanity waiting to be expressed. She lays out a very practical and simple, do-able plan that anyone in any walk of life can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she uses the metaphor of Fairy Godmother, she includes men as Beary Godfathers. Her story will make you laugh, cry and think, but most importantly, it will inspire you to believe that there is hope for a new world, that love is the magic glue of our universe and &amp;ldquo;love is the opening door&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
