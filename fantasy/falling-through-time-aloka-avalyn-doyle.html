  <title>Falling Through Time - Aloka, Avalyn Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1987 and thirty-three-year-old Lina has just left her husband and two teenage sons and returned to her mothers house, emotionally spent from the pain of harboring the secret of domestic violence for too long. As her journey eventually leads her to the mountains and into the arms of new lovers, Lina has no idea of what lies ahead. She only hopes it is peace.
After enjoying sexual freedom for a while, she remarries a kind and gentle man and lives in the Australian Alps. But Lina begins to feel dissatisfied with monogamy, leaving her with unfulfilled dreams of freedom and travel. After she makes a shocking discovery of past lives as a sacred prostitute and realizes how it has affected her modern, sexual adventures, Lina travels with nothing but a backpack to the Middle East to search for answers. Vulnerable and terrified, she plummets through time, reliving death and entombment. When she meets old lovers, her fear is explained. But can she survive illness and exposure within a strange but beautiful culture?
Falling through Time reveals one womans fascinating search for God, meaning, and redemption after she travels to the Middle East to uncover secrets from her soul." />
