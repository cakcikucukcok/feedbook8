  <title>Jaguar and Five Rabbit - Norris Ray Peery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within these pages lives a story of love, of friendships, and of families, which are imbedded within a place and time, where the most diametrically opposite of human values existed and survived side-by-side, where heaven and hell daily rubbed their social elbows, and each of their elements were ever threatening the survival of their counterpart. Here is a story of people caught between the gears and wheels of their god&#39;s invisible machinery that daily drives their universe. Here is portrayed both the physical and psychological landscape of a time whose structures, writings, and beliefs have now been systematically destroyed by a new foreign master and a new foreign religion, which has a so-called &quot;Modern Strategy&quot; about blood sacrifice and intellectual domination. Here is the story of lovers, whose powerful desire to be forever together, is the magic that guides them through an ever-fluxing nightmare that is their reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story opens in the capitol city of the Aztec Empire during the night of November the 8th in the year 1516 CE." />
