  <title>Comprehensive National Power - P K Singh, Y K Gera, Sandeep Dewan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the book “Comprehensive National Power – A Model for India” an attempt has been made to quantify and describe those attributes that most accurately portray India’s capability to exert its national will. An effort has been made to access how various powers compared in this study could exert their national power to leverage the international environment to their national advantage. This study has been carried out in the backdrop of the rise and fall of countries and empires, and an assessment of the inbuilt longevity to power.
This well researched book is a result of the project study allocated by Headquarters Army Training Command to the United Service Institution of India, New Delhi. This study is likely to be a foundational work for future studies on the subject. This would eventually lead to more awareness of the concept of Comprehensive National Power. As a result a national consensus is likely to emerge on the steps India would need to take to further hone its Comprehensive National Power in order to realise the national aspirations." />
