  <title>Forbidden No More - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trisha&amp;#39;s husband left her for a younger and prettier woman. She needs to know that her classic hourglass shape is still desirable. When she sees her nineteen-year-old son Lucas just out of the shower, she realizes how much he resembles his dad at the same age. But can she compete with a hot babe his own age?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trisha was too horrified by what she had done to make sandwiches now. Her mind whirled with confusion as she hurried away from Lucas. On her way through the kitchen, she grabbed a cold bottle of beer out of the fridge and padded to her bedroom. After closing the door, she sat down on her bed and stared into space, sipping the beer occasionally. She wondered what she had just done to her lifeand to her son.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even now, she could barely think. What if she had really injured the son she had treasured all her life? He was in no condition to study now. Maybe she had ruined his chance to prepare for the SAT. She should have just let him go chase girls on his own. That would be normal for a guy his age, especially one as muscular and handsome as he was. At least she could have controlled her temper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, what was she doing? She hadn&amp;#39;t thought anything through. Maybe her mind was completely scrambled after losing her husband. After all, she was middle-aged and overweight. Of course Lucas wanted the young, slender, busty girl in the picture. Why wouldn&amp;#39;t he?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another thought struck her. What if she had just hurt her chance to have grandchildren some day? She set the beer on the nightstand and pulled off the T-shirt, which was still damp. At her dresser, she grabbed a nightshirt off the top and slipped it on. It happened to be white, with spaghetti straps and bra cups, and reached just past her butt, so it would not be too hot to wear. She collapsed on her bed, feeling guilty, hurt, and more confused than ever." />
