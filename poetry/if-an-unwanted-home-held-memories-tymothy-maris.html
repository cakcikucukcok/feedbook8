  <title>If an (Unwanted) Home Held Memories - Tymothy Maris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Book (Chapter 3: the Lost Years) is based on my experiences while living in OPPRESSION during the beginning of the new millennium. This Book could be much larger in size although I have left out many a shocking experience. Such experiences entail the following :: beatings of patients, patients fighting staff and/or patients (including myself), patients getting THE NEEDLE or THE BOX and staff retaliation against patients (including myself). Not to say all was bad, there were some good times, especially toward the end.
&lt;p&gt;	The cover of the book (9 nines falling from a dark cloud) onto a landscape with nine lonely trees signifies the 9 years and 9 months of the OPPRESSION. 
&lt;p&gt;	The Poems in this Book are mostly serious, sometimes funny and many times with a punch-line at the end. The Poems give one a hint, via a Year by Year (9 Years and 9 months) accounting of what is was like to live in Oppression in New York State , USA.
&lt;p&gt;	Many Poems are Imagery Poems, Rhyme Poems, Name Poems  and my own flavors.
