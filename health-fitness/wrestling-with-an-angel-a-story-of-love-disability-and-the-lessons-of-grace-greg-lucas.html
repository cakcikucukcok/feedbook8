  <title>Wrestling with an Angel: A Story of Love, Disability, and the Lessons of Grace - Greg Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It sounded at first like something out of an old horror movie. I thought maybe someone was just playing around, but then I heard it again and again, a loud piercing cry, and less like Hollywood every time. The windows were down in my police cruiser on that warm fall day, but I still couldn&amp;#39;t tell where the sounds came from. I began looking around for the unlikely sight of someone being disemboweled in a mall parking lot on a Saturday afternoon. Seeing nothing, and still hearing the screams, I called in a &amp;#39;disturbance.&amp;#39; Around the next corner I found the source of the commotion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So begins Greg Lucas&amp;#39; captivating account of life as a husband, a police officer, and Jake&amp;#39;s dad. Jake Lucas, the first of four children, lives with severe physical and mental challenges. Caring for him each day is an ordeal few of us can imagine, and this story of Jake&amp;#39;s first 17 years is not one you will soon forget. But the remarkable thing is how the whole narrative is saturated with wonder at the grace and goodness of God, who brings hope and promise through his Son into the darkest of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book, we see that Jake&amp;#39;s problems are our problems, only bigger, and the challenges of caring for him carry profound lessons about God&amp;#39;s care for us. &lt;em&gt;Wrestling with an Angel&lt;/em&gt; is about tragedy and laughter and pain and joy. It is about faith and grace and endurance and God&amp;#39;s unfailing, loving wisdom daily being worked out in each of our lives, whatever the nature or extent of our difficulties. Here is a book that may explain faith to you in ways you never quite grasped, through a life few of us can relate to. When it is all done, we come away better able to live as Christ calls us to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
