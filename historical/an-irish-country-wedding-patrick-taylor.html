  <title>An Irish Country Wedding - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Wedding&lt;/i&gt; is another heart-warming tale from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Patrick Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is in the air in the colourful Ulster village of Ballybucklebo, where Dr. Fingal Flahertie O&#39;Reilly has finally proposed to the darling of his youth, Kitty O&#39;Hallorhan. There&#39;s a wedding to be planned, but before O&#39;Reilly can make it to the altar, he and his young colleague, Barry Laverty, M.B., must deal with the usual round of eccentric patients--and crises both large and small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a G.P. in a place like Ballybucklebo often means more than simply splinting broken bones and tending to aches and pains. It can also mean helping a struggling young couple acquire their first home, clearing the name of a cat accused of preying on a neighbor&#39;s prize pigeons, and encouraging a bright working-class girl who dreams of someday becoming a doctor herself. And, if you&#39;re Barry Laverty, still smarting from a painful breakup, there might even be a chance for a new romance with a lovely school teacher, if her passionate political convictions don&#39;t get in the way.&lt;br&gt;Much has changed in Ballybucklebo, and bigger changes are in store, but the lives and practices of these Irish country doctors remain as captivating and irresistible as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
