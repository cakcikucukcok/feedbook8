  <title>The Source - Dr. Tara Swart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, a Neuroscientist and Senior Lecturer at MIT reveals the surprising science that supports The Law of Attraction as an effective tool for self-discovery and offers a guide to discovering your authentic self to access your best life now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-help books like &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; show us that if we can tap into &amp;#8220;The Law of Attraction,&amp;#8221; we have the power to change our destiny simply by reshaping our mind. Millions of people have used the ancient systems of manifestation and visualization to find health, success, love, friendship, wealth, and more. But does the &amp;#8220;Law of Attraction&amp;#8221; actually work? And more important, is this kind of life-changing philosophy within reach for everyone, even the most skeptical among us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Tara Swart, psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and Senior Lecturer at MIT shows us in &lt;em&gt;The Source&lt;/em&gt;, if we can strip away our skepticism, these ancient tools of manifestation and visualization are fundamentally powerful and incredibly effective at freeing us of self-limiting behaviors and propelling us toward our truest, most authentic selves. Swart reveals how and why these systems actually work by offering the latest breakthroughs in neuroscience and behavioral psychology, including lessons in neuroplasticity, magneticism, emotional and logical thinking, and even hydration, self-care, and relaxation. Next, she describes her own journey from skeptic to believer, and guides readers through the scientific breakthroughs and personal revelations that changed her from an unhappy, close-minded, and disconnected woman wanting more from life, to a successful entrepreneur living with confidence, purpose, and joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, most of the things we want&amp;#8212;health, happiness, wealth, love&amp;#8212;are governed by our ability to think, feel, and act&amp;#8212;in other words, by our brain. Dr. Swart combines the insights and inspiration of &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; with the practical lessons of &lt;em&gt;The Master Key System&lt;/em&gt; to help a new generation fulfill their dreams. &lt;em&gt;The Source&lt;/em&gt; is a rigorous, proven toolkit for unlocking our minds&amp;#8212;and reaching our fullest potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
