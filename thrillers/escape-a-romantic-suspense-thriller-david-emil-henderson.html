  <title>Escape!: A Romantic-Suspense-Thriller - David Emil Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s original intent for &amp;ldquo;Escape!&amp;rdquo; was a fast-paced romantic thriller suitable for escaping boredom while flying on a coast-to-coast airliner. While gazing at the rolling landscape beneath the wings, Henderson imagined a hot fugitive couple running from cold contract killers, while eluding pursuit by the FBI and every other law enforcement agency along their 2000-mile route from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean.&amp;nbsp; Among the plot&amp;rsquo;s surprises was one for the author: the unexpected emergence of the assertive and spicy Elissa Bennett Pope as the story&amp;rsquo;s brightest star.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elissa is the daughter of Italian-American parents in Chicago&amp;rsquo;s wealthiest suburb, groomed from puberty to marry a multi-millionaire like Patrick Livingston Pope, heir to Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Pope Machinery empire. Unfortunately, her prize had become a pugilist, beating her to pulp from time to time. Her desperate urge for freedom ended in a bitter divorce, and she escaped with just enough resources to become an independent real estate broker, property manager, and &amp;mdash; for personal therapy &amp;mdash; a summer stock theatrical performer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When California architect Grey Harper arrived in peaceful Lake Forest to convert a former military base into a $60 million luxury housing development, Elissa&amp;rsquo;s agency found a suitable cottage for him to rent. It was while meeting in that cottage that a strange intruder set in motion Elissa&amp;rsquo;s most hectic escape ever &amp;mdash; running with Harper for their lives, for more than 2000 miles in a Mercedes-Benz roadster, to a clifftop climax at Harper&amp;rsquo;s spectacular home in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Throughout the journey, Elissa is never quite sure whether Harper is just a brilliant architect with a California tan, water-blue eyes surrounded by crinkles whenever he smiled, a masculine voice and a wry sense of humor &amp;mdash; or a widower with a dark past, accused by the FBI of murdering his Chicago client to cover-up a major screw-up. Elissa&amp;rsquo;s survival is at stake in either case, and she must always rely upon her own wits and courage and cash, every minute of every day &amp;mdash; and night!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Online reader reviews of this novel have all posted four or five stars, including this brief comment: &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a fun read, you&amp;#39;ve found it! The pace and twists rank right up there with Dan Brown but with better developed characters and a more realistic (but no less exciting!) plot, making this a book that&amp;#39;s hard to put down.&amp;quot; (Posted by MariC on Amazon)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
