      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;A href=book_excerpt.asp?bookid=27784 target=&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;Click here to read an excerpt from the book.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My book Deep Thoughts has a wide range of thoughts about life, thoughts that every person has experienced at least once in their life, the book is filled with thoughts and meanings to everyday life, which are very intense to the mind, such as love and the feeling of losing love.  My thoughts on having a day but truly not knowing this may be your last day or how blessed we are to have this day. My thoughts on wishing you could have yesterday back to change a moment of that day.  My thoughts on making our children better so they will have a better future than us.  My thoughts on knowing how truly blessed you are just to be with that special person in your life. I have broken down words such as love, bless, color, black, touch, day, thug, system, and miss all these word with a meaning that will allow you to look at them with a different understanding.
This book was written just to allow people to think about certain thoughts or feelings we sometime take for granted or really dont even think about because its just a regular part of life or should I say just the normal way to live.
Are you ready to order your book today? To enjoy thoughts on everyday things like you have never done before?  If so, get your copy of Deep Thoughts today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review on Deep Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep Thoughts, By Phillip Reed, is a wonderful book of information and &lt;br&gt;
sayings that will open your mind and make you think and look within &lt;br&gt;
yourself  for meaning.  Sometimes we pass the day just to get things done, to &lt;br&gt;
start a task and finish it, without distraction. But life is full of &lt;br&gt;
distractions. Life is full of thoughts, full of events.  What if you stop each day &lt;br&gt;
and  read a paragraph, read a saying, read something that will get your mind &lt;br&gt;
and your heart going? Could we all use a moment each day to reflect, to &lt;br&gt;
gain knowledge, to gain emotion?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Reed&#39;s book gives you that.  With thoughts like, &quot;Remember to be all &lt;br&gt;
you can be, you only have to be yourself!!&quot; and &quot;In order to be a great Leader, &lt;br&gt;
you had to be a great Follower! You can&#39;t be one without the other!&quot; With &lt;br&gt;
thoughts on Love, Sometimes, Hard Times, Understanding, Locked Up, If &lt;br&gt;
Only For a Day, and much, much more, Reed gives us a small sentence or &lt;br&gt;
paragraph that give you a jumpstart on your day, or on your week.&lt;br&gt;
In school, we used to have daily thoughts and that is just what this &lt;br&gt;
book give us, daily thoughts, but &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot;.  I have found so many &lt;br&gt;
uses for this book. I have torn pages and given to my children when I think they &lt;br&gt;
need a push or a lesson.  I have put pages up on my bulletin board in front &lt;br&gt;
of me to keep me going, to keep me focused. I have printed and given copies &lt;br&gt;
to friends and family.  I keep the book close and read a page a day, when &lt;br&gt;
I finish the book I start over again. I can&#39;t wait for the next 
installment of &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is a must read for parents, for business professionals, for &lt;br&gt;
everyday people, for EVERYBODY.  Pick it up. Read It and explore, not only the &lt;br&gt;
book, but what&#39;s inside you.&lt;br&gt;
