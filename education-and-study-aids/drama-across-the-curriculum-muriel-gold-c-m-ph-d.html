  <title>Drama Across the Curriculum - Muriel Gold C.M. Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Golds Fictional Family technique was an invitation to begin one of the most exciting experiences of my teaching career a method that would address all my teaching goals: effective writing instruction; confidence building; and writing across the curriculum. Looking at the technique from a purely pedagogic viewpoint, I had no idea what excitement the Fictional Family would engender in students from all disciplines, from fine arts to business, an excitement which has been a satisfaction to encounter. &lt;/p&gt;_JUDY KALMAN
&lt;p&gt;As I read through the chapters, I am convinced again and again of the power of drama as a learning medium across the curriculum. I am convinced, yes, partly by the various teachers who use the Fictional Family techniques creatively and sensitively, but particularly by the learners who seem to have benefited from the techniques and whose learning is so evident in what they produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you now to read these descriptions and to judge for yourself It is the quality and potential of students learning which this volume places in the spotlight and which drama seeks to serve. &lt;/p&gt;
