  <title>Twist of Fate - Michael Belanger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi, my name is ray; I sit here with pending assault charges and possible murder charges against me. I acted on my own accord and someone is unconscious and unstable. To tell you the truth, I dont care if he lives or dies. If I am guilty then at least I have a roof over my head for the rest of my life. The food is worse than the schools food, unless it is your last meal, then it is better than most 4 star restaurants on the outside. The jail has a gym that consists of a basketball court and weights. There is a baseball field and a track outside, just in case I want to exercise my body. The only bad thing is that they are only open from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. everyday. It is kind of like having something that someone else wants and tormenting him or her with it and keeping it anyway. If I decided to exercise my mind, there is a library. This Library has both Apple and IBM computers. I can even take college-level courses as part of my rehab. In a small way this place kind of reminds me of the orphanage." />
