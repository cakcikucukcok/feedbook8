  <title>Mount Terminus - David Grand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Grand&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Mount Terminus&lt;/i&gt; is a dark, majestic novel about art, family, overwhelming love, and the birth of Los Angeles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his mother&#39;s death, young Bloom boards a train with his bereaved father, Jacob, to travel west across mountains and deserts to California: Mount Terminus, their new home at the desolate end of the world. There, in a villa built atop a rare desert spring, they live apart from society, supported by the income from Jacob&#39;s invention, the Rosenbloom Loop, a piece of technology that has revolutionized the nascent art of filmmaking. There, Bloom grows up in the shadow of his father&#39;s grief, with only a pair of servants, the house&#39;s ghosts, and his own artistic muse for company.&lt;br&gt;     But Jacob can&#39;t forever protect his family from his past--the dramatic series of events that has taken him from the Hebrew Orphan Asylum on New York City&#39;s Lower East Side and into the graces of beautiful twin girls, and finally to this fragile refuge in pre-Hollywood Los Angeles. And Bloom, now an eccentric dark genius, can&#39;t live alone at the top of the mountain forever. Prodded by his newly discovered half brother, in every way his opposite, Bloom will have to come down to meet the world. Otherwise the orange farmers and the vaqueros, the speculators and the developers, the artists and the barons of the silver screen, will surely come up the mountain to meet him.&lt;br&gt;     Triumphant and enthralling, &lt;i&gt;Mount Terminus &lt;/i&gt;marks a magnificent return for David Grand; it&#39;s the novel he was born to write.&lt;/p&gt;" />
