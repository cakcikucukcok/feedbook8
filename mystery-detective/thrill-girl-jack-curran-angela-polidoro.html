  <title>Thrill Girl - Jack Curran, Angela Polidoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a tense summer in the City of Angels. A killer is on the loose. She&amp;rsquo;s blonde, she&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, and she murders bad guys.&amp;nbsp; On three different occasions, she thwarted a mugging in progress, saving the innocent, dispatching the guilty, and fading away like a whisper in the rain. She never waits around for thanks.&amp;nbsp; Apparently she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who is this woman?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Curran, star reporter, is determined to find out.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;rsquo;s a good citizen. A war hero. A journalist who wants to write fiction, which he plans to once he files an exclusive on Thrill Girl&amp;rsquo;s identity. When Thrill Girl strikes a fourth time, adding two more to her body count while saving a pretty shop girl, his investigation leads him to socialite Alana Maxwell.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;s blonde. She&amp;rsquo;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does she murder bad guys?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his publisher&amp;rsquo;s warning to beware her very connected and powerful step-brother, Jack goes to ask her, face to face. But Alana Maxwell doesn&amp;rsquo;t care that a newspaperman is tracking her like a hound with a snout full of fox.&amp;nbsp; She has only one thing on her mind, saving her younger brother&amp;rsquo;s life. It&amp;rsquo;s something she&amp;rsquo;ll do anything to accomplish. &lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;. Including taking illicit drugs, living with blackouts and hallucinations, and putting herself in the hands of a mysterious doctor she has no good reason to trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Jack can nail down Alana&amp;#39;s connection to Thrill Girl, LA is rocked by an even more lurid crime. A bum is ripped to pieces near the Griffith Park Zoo. The coroner says the bite marks have traces of human and animal saliva. The cops go crazy. Jack&amp;rsquo;s newspaper proclaims a monster&amp;rsquo;s in town. The good citizens of LA lock their doors and windows and clamor for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack is determined to provide them. He hears a rumor about something called a &lt;em&gt;der Katzenjunge&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Translation? A European myth about men with the mutant ability to temporarily transmogrify into a savage, feline-like creature. What the hell would a crackpot story like that have to do with Thrill Girl, he wonders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrill Girl&amp;rsquo;s story is the epitome of &lt;em&gt;noir&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The complex plot examines the vibe of the decade of the 1950s &amp;ndash; a time historians refer to as the &amp;ldquo;Age of Anxiety.&amp;rdquo; This post-Atomic era predates the upheaval of the 1960s, but the seeds of the turmoil to come started in the years after WWII. Sexual and racial roles, upended by war,&amp;nbsp;rapidly evolved in ways many found difficult to fathom. For the first time, there was a widespread need for, and availability of, mood-altering prescription drugs. Scientific advances &amp;nbsp;accumulated at a rate most could not fathom, and the military-industrial complex was beginning to assume a powerful influence over the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jack says,&lt;em&gt; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s as if there&amp;rsquo;s an earthquake shaking all the time. Life isn&amp;rsquo;t in any way the same as it was before the war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he uncovers a plot involving the evilest type of medical research and experimentation, Jack finally understands the dark heart of the Maxwell family&amp;rsquo;s secrets. The ramifications of these secrets drive the crimes he is investigating, and much, much more. &amp;nbsp;On a frenetic night racked by murder, revenge-fueled confrontation, and the betrayal of those he trusted most, a shocking twist of plot leaves Jack with only two questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will he, and what can he do to get the true story of Thrill Girl out into the open?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
