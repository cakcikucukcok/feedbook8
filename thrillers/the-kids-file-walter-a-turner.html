      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Max Cantu is a teacher turned private detective in the beautiful city of Newport Beach, California. He and his wife, Bryn, just welcomed their newborn baby daughter home. Brooke is everything a daddy could hope for. Max would be content sitting around, rocking her in her crib, and staring at her all day. Of course, work has other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returns to his office one morning to find three frantic calls from a Ms. Ella Frou. Ms. Frou soon shows up on his doorstep, and she has a serious complaint: her beloved dog, Casey, has been stolen.. So begins several disparate cases that will take Max away from his cozy home and newborn girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max comes upon a variety of clients. He interacts with a cross section of characters in order to solve his cases.&lt;/p&gt;" />
