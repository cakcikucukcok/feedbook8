  <title>KILLING MAINE - Mike Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="KIRKUS - Another stellar ride from Bond; checking out Pono&#39;s first adventure [SAVING PARADISE]isn&#39;t a prerequisite, but this will make readers want to.   Book Description:  Surfer and Special Forces vet Pono Hawkins quits sunny Hawaii for Maine&#39;s brutal winter to help former SF buddy Bucky Franklin beat a murder rap. The same Bucky who once sent Pono to military prison then married his girlfriend Lexie. But in Special Forces you never leave a buddy behind no matter what they&#39;ve done. Especially if they once saved your life.   An unknown sniper has shot environmental exec Ronnie Dalt, and the police say it was Bucky. So Pono finds himself hooked up with Bucky&#39;s wife Lexie trying to find Bucky an alibi. And meets an old flame, the fierce and beautiful attorney Erica, and then the dead man&#39;s wife Abigail, who has never met a man she couldn&#39;t devour alive.   Unknown killers stalk Pono as he tries to unravel Ronnie&#39;s death. Nothing is certain, no one can be trusted, no place is safe. There&#39;s a million square miles of wildlands out there to hide a man&#39;s body. And with a rap sheet that includes two jail sentences, Pono is the number one target of every cop in the state.  Sadly Maine turns out to be as politically corrupt as Hawaii, with huge energy corporations gobbling up the state&#39;s beautiful mountains and purchasing its politicians at bargain prices. Once again Pono finds himself hunted, shot at, betrayed, stalked by knife-wielding assassins, and in love with three women.  Second in the Pono Hawkins series after the critically-acclaimed, best-seller SAVING PARADISE, KILLING MAINE is an insider&#39;s view of crooked Maine politics, the state&#39;s magical and fast-disappearing natural beauty, and how a lone commando hunts down those who hunt him, and is based on the author&#39;s own experiences in Maine, the Middle East and elsewhere." />
