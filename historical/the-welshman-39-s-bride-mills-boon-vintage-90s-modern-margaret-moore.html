          &lt;strong&gt;THE LADY GENEVIEVE WAS IN DESPERATE NEED OF RESCUE &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So much so that even Welsh charmer Dylan DeLanyea looked like the answer to her prayers. But as she took her solemn vows before the exalted guests, she could only hope that her handsome husband would someday forgive her for trapping him into a hasty wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dylan&#39;s Lady wife was a woman of many talents. Indeed, his unplanned marriage to the beautiful chatelaine was turning out to be very pleasant indeed… and definitely more passionate than he had ever dreamed!&lt;/p&gt;
