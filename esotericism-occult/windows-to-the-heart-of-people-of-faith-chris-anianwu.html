  <title>Windows to the Heart of People of Faith - Chris Anianwu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The people who wrote their names in gold in the sight of God were people of faith. Those ordinary people changed their world by believing God in the face of incredible odds. Each of them passed through unimaginable circumstances but because they held unto God, He moved in their favor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To prove God as they did or to excel their exploits in the field of faith, it is important for us to peep into their mindset when they were in the eyes of the storms of life. The problem is that if we fail to walk in faith, we miss God. On the other hand, if we fail to learn from people of faith, we stand to lose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A close look at what people of faith said or did when they were in the battlefield will help anybody who wants to travel far with God. A good understanding of how they were feeling and proper appropriation to our circumstances will give us the much needed victory. If they succeeded with few examples to guide them, we can do better. The ball is in our court." />
