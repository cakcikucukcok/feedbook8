  <title>Emmy &amp; Oliver - Robin Benway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emmy and Oliver were going to be best friends forever, or maybe even more, before their futures were ripped apart. In Emmy&amp;#39;s soul, despite the space and time between them, their connection has never been severed. But is their story still written in the stars? Or are their hearts like the pieces of two different puzzles&amp;#8212;impossible to fit together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmy just wants to be in charge of her own life. . . . She wants to stay out late, surf her favorite beach&amp;#8212;go anywhere without her parents&amp;#39; relentless worrying. But Emmy&amp;#39;s parents can&amp;#39;t seem to let her grow up&amp;#8212;not since the day Oliver disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver needs a moment to figure out his heart. . . . He&amp;#39;d thought, all these years, that his dad was the good guy. He never knew that it was his father who had kidnapped him and kept him on the run. Discovering it, and finding himself returned to his old hometown, all at once, has his heart racing, and his thoughts swirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers who love Sarah Dessen will devour these pages with hearts in throats as Emmy and Oliver struggle to face the messy, confusing consequences of Oliver&amp;#39;s father&amp;#39;s crime. Full of romance, coming-of-age emotion, and heartache, these two equally compelling characters create an unforgettable story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
