  <title>The Scottish Novels - Robert Louis Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduced by Jenni Calder and Roderick Watson.  Kidnapped - Catriona - The Master of Ballantrae - Weir of Hermiston  These four great novels take us deep into Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s imaginative and bitter-sweet relationship with his native country.  Kidnapped, and its sequel Catriona, are renowned the world over as supreme stories of adventure and romance. On another level they also explore the subtle divisions of Scottish history and character in the eighteenth century, and (some would say) the present day.  The Master of Ballantrae takes a darker and more disturbing turn, with its tale of rival brothers caught in a web  of hatred, obsession, love and betrayal which draws them to their end in the frozen wastes of North America.  Stevenson&#39;s fascination with the divided nature of the human self (most obviously demonstrated in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde) appears again in the Weir of Hermiston with its terrible confrontation between a father and his son.  With an unsurpassed combination of physical adventure and psychological insight, The Scottish Novels have moved and thrilled readers and writers from Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries to the present day." />
