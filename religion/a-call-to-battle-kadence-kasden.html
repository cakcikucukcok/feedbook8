  <title>A Call to Battle - Kadence Kasden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At an early age, Kadence Kasden gave into Satan and accepted the plans he had for her. Since battling rejection from childhood from her mother and her peers at school, Satan seemed like the only refuge and safety from the trials she walked through on a daily basis. Instead of making her life easier it slowly started shifting down a downward spiral from demonic visitations, witchcraft, and psychic power to eventually becoming a servant to Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Call to Battle is directed to anyone who has ever struggled with rejection, hopelessness, or dont believe they can break Satans controlling powers over their lives. Kadences story offers hope and shows how Jesus Christ can rescue and save anyone who is walking alongside the pit of hell. Instead of being one of Satans servants, Kadence is now marching in the army of God, demonstrating to the lost the love and salvation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
