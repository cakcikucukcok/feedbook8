  <title>The Psychic Vampire - Dr. Thomas E. Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rosemary Shane is a beautiful woman, and it is time for John Whitney, her fianc and the oldest son in a content Christian family, to bring her home to meet everyone. As she sits down to dinner, no one knows that encased within her are demons far worse than any storied horror. Rosemary is a psychic vampire.
John, disillusioned from his military service in Iraq, is desperately searching for meaning in life. The Whitney family is thrilled to meet Rosemary, but they have no idea that misery is about to befall all of them. In his vulnerable state, John has fallen victim to Rosemarys powerful spell. As soon as the family realizes Rosemary is using her radical, hellfire version of Christianity to subdue and placate his mind, they make every attempt to combat the cultish brainwashing that has seemingly transformed John into a completely different person.
If it is true that legendary vampires find nourishment in human blood, then psychic vampires must feed on the human mind. In this classic battle of good versus evil, the Whitney family must quickly find a way to save their brother before Rosemarys satanic forces steal him away from them forever." />
