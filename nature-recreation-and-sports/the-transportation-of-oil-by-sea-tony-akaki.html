  <title>The Transportation of Oil by Sea - Tony Akaki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before the coming of the dot com era it was by no accident that the richest individuals in the world were involved with tankers. Probably the most famous ship owner in the world was Aristotle Socrates Onassis. But before one looks at tanker freights of which Onassis among others managed to secure a good return on capital it is crucial to recap and examine some of the factors that affected the tanker industry starting with the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Transportation of Oil by Sea&lt;/i&gt; offers a fascinating introductory account of crude oil transportation and how international issues from World War II, pre-independence Zimbabwe, and the Iran-Iraq War have been influenced by considerations for oil production and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Tony Akaki presents a diversity of geographical, political, environmental, and economic insights in one volume, offering a compelling look at this often-overlooked aspect of history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
