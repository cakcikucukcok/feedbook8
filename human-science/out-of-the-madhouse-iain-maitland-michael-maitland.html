  <title>Out of the Madhouse - Iain Maitland, Michael Maitland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once upon a time, there lived a happy family called the Maitlands. Iain, the father, was a writer. Tracey, the mother, worked at a nearby school. They had three bright and charming children, Michael, Sophie and Adam. It looked like the perfect family life. 
Until October 2012, when Iain received a message. Michael had been taken to hospital. Years of depression, anxiety and anorexia had taken their toll, and he had pneumonia and a collapsed lung. The doctors weren&#39;t sure if he would make it.
Told with humour and frankness through Michael&#39;s diary entries and Iain&#39;s own reflections, Out of the Madhouse charts Michael&#39;s journey to recovery from entering the Priory and returning home, to becoming a mental health ambassador for young people. Sharing tips and techniques that have helped them and others to self-manage, this is an essential resource for anyone experiencing depression, anxiety, OCD and similar issues." />
