  <title>White Thaw: the Helheim Conspiracy - Paul Mark Tag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Linda Kipling has had her share of excitement working as a meteorologist with the Naval Research Laboratory. Twice in four years, she and her boss, the arrogant Dr. Victor Silverstein, have faced international crises requiring heroic action. Now, in 2011, Kipling faces her most formidable foe yet: her only remaining relatives, the Mller family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debates about climate change continue as two researchers in Greenland mysteriously disappear. Kipling soon comes to a horrific realization: not all observed climatic aberrations are coming from natural variation or an increase in greenhouse gases. Instead, someone is tampering with nature, risking a cataclysmic event that could destroy the world. Her dying father is suspicious; he believes distant relatives in South America are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mller family was once part of Hitlers inner circle. They escaped from Germany in 1945 with a fortune in gold, and now they hope to alter the worlds climate for their own purposes. Kipling must head to Greenland under the guise of familial reunion in order to dismantle the Mller plan and save the planet from a climatic apocalypse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Mark Tag[s] books never disappoint. He is a gifted writer and knows how to craft a great story.  White Thaw takes us on a great adventure [involving] global warming [and] poses the question of just how far would a group go to win.&lt;/p&gt;
