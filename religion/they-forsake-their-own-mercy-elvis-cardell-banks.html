  <title>They Forsake Their Own Mercy - Elvis Cardell Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for the sins of the people.  The Lord did not want those who believed in Him to perish.  Sadly, only a few souls will enter through the narrow gate that leads to eternal life.  (Matthew 7:13-15)  Many souls purport to believe in Jesus Christ, but they do not believe in Him according to what has been written in the scriptures.  Satan has sent false teachers into the world and deceived the people.  In keeping the people in darkness, Satan has kept the people separated from God.
In this remarkable work, author Elvis Cardell Banks has exposed Satans method of deception and debunked many of the insidious lies the devil has crafted to deceive the people.  Jesus repeatedly warned the people to beware of those who would teach lies and cause them to reject the knowledge of salvation.  (Hosea 4:6)  Despite the Masters warning, nearly all of creation will be destroyed.  Wolves have put on sheeps clothing and lured the people away from the Shepherd.
A book that is sure to elevate readers spiritual knowledge and understanding, Banks penetrating and insightful prose exposes Satans witchcraft and refutes false prophets lying vanities." />
