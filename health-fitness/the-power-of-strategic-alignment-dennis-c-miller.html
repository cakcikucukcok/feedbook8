  <title>The Power of Strategic Alignment - Dennis C. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dennis has written a practical approach to an issue that plagues so many organizations. The Power of Strategic Alignment is important for any corporation but it is an absolute imperative for a non-profit organization. There is such a temptation to follow the money. Additionally, there are so many needs in the world that can easily distract good-hearted people and cause organizations to splinter in various directions. 
David Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer
Make-A-Wish America
Any organization&#39;s impact depends on strong leaders and not just the CEO. The Power of Strategic Alignment helps senior leaders harness the power of your non-profits&#39; strategy to achieve even more for those you serve.
Carolyn S. Miles, President &amp; Chief Executive
Save the Children
This is a must-read book for nonprofit CEOs and board members that highlight the importance of communication and developing an organization&#39;s leaders, strategies and goals to be successful. The book really illustrates the key elements to make things happen and getting positive results.
Jonathan R. Pearson, Executive Director, Corporate Philanthropy and Community Affairs
Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey
Drawing on his rich experience as the CEO and now as a highly regarded nonprofit strategic advisor, Dennis Miller provides the reader with a succinct yet comprehensive formula for nonprofit organization leaders and boards to maximize their effectiveness and success. He stresses how an organization, in order to have a successful strategic plan, must have a clear and compelling vision; have completed a comprehensive assessment of key strengths and critical weaknesses; possess a comprehensive funding plan; and complete a detailed plan for implementation and execution. I urge senior executives and board leaders of nonprofit organizations to read this book.
