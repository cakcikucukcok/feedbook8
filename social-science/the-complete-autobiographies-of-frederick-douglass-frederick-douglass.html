  <title>The Complete Autobiographies of Frederick Douglass - Frederick Douglass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frederick Douglass was born a slave, he escaped a brutal system and through sheer force of will educated himself and became an abolitionist, editor, orator, author, statesman, and reformer. This three-in-one omnibus edition of Frederick Douglass autobiographies provides the quintessential narrative of his life. &#39;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&#39; is one of the most influential autobiographies ever written. This classic did as much as or more than any other book to motivate the abolitionists to continue to fight for freedom in America. This is one of the most unlikely and powerful success stories ever written. In Frederick Douglass&#39; autobiography &#39;My Bondage and My Freedom&#39; we can see the power of literacy and belief. Douglass transforms himself from slave to an abolitionist, journalist, orator, and one of the most powerful voices to emerge from the American civil rights movement with little more than force of will. The breadth of his accomplishments gave hope to generations of people who came after him in their fight for civil rights. &#39;The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&#39; was Douglass&#39; third autobiography. In it he was able to go into greater detail about his life as a slave and his escape from slavery, as he and his family were no longer in any danger from the reception of his work. It is also the only of Douglass&#39; autobiographies to discuss his life during and after the Civil War, including his encounters with American Presidents such as Lincoln, Grant, and Garfield." />
