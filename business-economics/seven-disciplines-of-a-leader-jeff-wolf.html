  <title>Seven Disciplines of A Leader - Jeff Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Recognize, develop, and embody great leadership&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seven Disciplines of A Leader&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive manual for building better leaders. Author and executive coach Jeff Wolf is a respected authority on leadership, and his strategies and inspiration have fostered dramatic growth in some of the nation&#39;s top companies. In this book, he shares the secrets of great leadership to help readers align professional development and exemplify these traits themselves. Each of the Disciplines is valuable on its own, but together they add up to more than a sum of their parts, and work synergistically to propel leaders to higher and higher effectiveness and companies to better and better business. From initiative, to planning, to community service, readers will gain deep insight into what separates the good from the great, and how organizations can nurture these qualities in their employees with leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good leader gets results, but a great leader inspires every single member of the team to reach their utmost potential every single time. A great leader makes everyone shine, and provides the vision, the tools, and the support people need to do their very best work. This book describes how it&#39;s done, and how greatness can be learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover the traits that make leaders great&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Align leadership development training to maximize potential&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Foster the right attitudes and behaviors for better outcomes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build a culture of sustainable success that permeates the organization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individual achievement is great, but fostering a culture of achievement sends business into the future on an upward trajectory. It&#39;s more than just a single inspired employee; it&#39;s about recognizing the signs of potential leadership and nurturing them to fruition throughout the organization. &lt;i&gt;Seven Disciplines of A Leader&lt;/i&gt; is the field guide to great leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
