  <title>Benedict&#39;s Rule: A Translation and Commentary - Terrance G. Kardong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Benedict&amp;#39;s Rule: A Translation and Commentary&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;is the first line-by-line exegesis of the entire Rule of Benedict written originally in English. This full commentary - predominately a literary and historical criticism - is based on and includes a new translation and is accompanied by essays on Benedict&amp;#39;s spiritual doctrine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A monk who has striven to live according to the Rule of Benedict for thirty-five years, Father Kardong relates it to modern monastic life while examining the sources (Cassian, Augustine, and Basil) Benedict used to establish his Rule. Overviews - summaries of notes, source criticism, or structural criticism - follow some chapters, and a large bibliography of the current scholarship and source references are also included.&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Benedict&amp;#39;s Rule: A Translation and Commentary&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;also includes the Latin text of the&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Regula Benedicti&lt;/I&gt;. This reference work is invaluable to libraries and to those who are called to interpret the Rule. It will be opened again and again. Indexed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
