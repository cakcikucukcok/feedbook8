  <title>Letters to the Rock - Leonie Phoenix, Leonie Phoenix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Letters to the Rock is the story of a spiritual journey, told in poems, starting from reliance on worldly concerns, through conflict, to the healing process, and eventual trust in the True Rock, Jesus Christ.
The poems are simple, honest and moving. They will tug on your heart-strings and inspire your spirit. They journal a painful emotional struggle, followed by deep spiritual healing, to the ultimate arrival at joy in faith and trust in God. 
Leonie Phoenix is an avid believer that God can transform any situation to bring about good. She hopes that through sharing her experiences, she can help others find new meaning and purpose in their lives.  She lives in the Caribbean with her husband and children.
Fascinating and beautiful. I like the whole idea, and how it is expressed. It is excellent food for thought. Brenda Quin, co-author of That Still Small Voice.
Thought-provoking The writer has understood that the suffering endured now will lead to eventual true joy if the individual uses it to empty him or herself of their worldly desires and replaces them with the in-dwelling Spirit of God, who refills us with the peace and love and mind of Christ. Peter Westin, co-author of That Still Small Voice.
I enjoyed the poems very much. They conjured up many images and the message from the writing has helped me with my own personal inner struggles. I got a deep understanding of the writer. She realises God doesnt always answer her pleas and cries in the way she wants. But, no matter where this journey takes her, she will always win through. She has learnt to trust God. She praises Him and her heart is now on fire within Gods warmth. Colin Wilson, author of The Judith Code.
Leonies writings are an expression of her very heart, body, soul and mind. Cathartic and healing, her pen creates a space for spirituality which takes her readers from the underworld to the divine. She&#39;s the pilgrim poet. Quincy Brown, Performing Artiste and Radio Personality." />
