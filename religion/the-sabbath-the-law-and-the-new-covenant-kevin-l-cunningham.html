  <title>The Sabbath, the Law, and the New Covenant - Kevin L. Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Religion is a hard topic to discuss, especially with family members who do not have the same religious beliefs. This book began as a paper given to family members and friends in an attempt to show them what the scriptures teach about the Sabbath. Though a number of Sabbath-keeping church members and leaders refused to discuss the paper, other ministers and church friends thought it should be published. Years of studying and writing have culminated into The Sabbath, the Law, and the New Covenant.  This book takes the central theme of the Bible, Gods redemptive plan for mankind, and walks the reader through the scriptures.  It begins with the plans inception and then explains how the plan was introduced to man, how it began to unfold, and finally how the plan was fulfilled.  This book highlights many of the scriptures that teach about the Sabbath, the Old Testament Laws, including the Ten Commandments, and the New Testament covenant of Jesus Christ, while comparing some widely held beliefs with the word of God. For all who truly love the word of God and worship on the seventh-day Sabbath, this book is a must-read. Those who wish to learn about the subject matter will also find the information insightful, coming from one who formerly worshiped on the seventh-day Sabbath." />
