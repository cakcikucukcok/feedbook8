  <title>Jungle Jim - D. P. De Lucchi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world has ended and only Jim is to blame... And possibly God. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; It wasnt long ago that Jim was dreaming of a perfect world; a world of peace and plenty, a place where people dont hurt or bother one another but instead try to understand each other, though when Jim dreamt of such a place, it had not sounded like a curse. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;   Jungle Jim is the story of a post-modern world that almost worked but failed during a growing pain and the man who witnessed it all happen, just as the ancient prophecies and calendars foretold. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;   Follow Jims epic saga from a fiery airplane in the sky, to a cold clammy hole in the jungle; from a hole in the jungle, to the real world, a brand new utopia full of colorful animals, and friendly dinosaurs. Trace Jims steps back from one side of the hole to the other and back again, to find a bloated and gassy old man in a bunker who is not sure whether to blame God or himself for the worlds he has seen destroyed, and finally, ask the daunting questions that Jim thought he had already answered during his life of pseudo-slavery as a disgruntled and under-appreciated grocer that inevitably sent him on his folly.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; What is perfection? and What is happiness? And most importantly What is the purpose of all of this?" />
