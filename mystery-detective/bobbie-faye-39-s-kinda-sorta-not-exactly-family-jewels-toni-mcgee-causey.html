  <title>Bobbie Faye&#39;s (kinda, sorta, not exactly) Family Jewels - Toni McGee Causey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Bobbie Faye&#39;s Very (very, very, very) Bad Day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Causey doesn&#39;t miss a beat in this wonderful, wacky celebration of Southern eccentricity.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Publisher&#39;s Weekly, &lt;/i&gt;starred review &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s about time women had an Amazon to look up to... Bobbie Faye is a hurricane-force heroine who makes this novel the perfect adventure yarn.&quot;-- &lt;i&gt;The Tampa Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you like Janet Evanovich, if you&#39;re looking for a lot of unlikely action (when is the last time someone you know escaped a burning boat by lassoing an oil rig?), or if you&#39;re simply having a bad day, go out and find Bobbie Faye. She&#39;s an outrageous hoot.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The New Orleans Times-Picayune&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bobbie Faye, Southern, eloquent, kick-ass, highly accomplished and just plain nuts, is a magnet for the most colorful collection of riff-raff and the most sexually compelling males south of Minneapolis. Throw in an unlikely MacGuffin and you&#39;ve got a very, (very, very, very) entertaining book.&quot;--Harley Jane Kozak, Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Dating Dead Men &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been a whole freaking month since Bobbie Faye Sumrall had blown up anything or been shot at, and that was almost a new record. Then her diva cousin Francesca waltzed up to where she manned the gun counter in Ce Ce&#39;s Cajun Outfitter and Feng Shui Emporium and everything just went to hell. Fast.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca&#39;s mom has disappeared with exceptionally valuable diamonds swiped from Francesca&#39;s dad (difficult marriage) so &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; Francesca broadcast to every insane psycho that Bobbie Faye could recover the ersatz family jewels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accused of one man&#39;s murder, Bobbie Faye&#39;s on the run as an unintentional Pied Piper to a rabid band of thieves. She has to find the diamonds, figure out the motives of the dead sexy FBI agent who&#39;s pressing her for more than just the jewels, all while racing to side-step her steamy (and steamed) detective ex-boyfriend before the deadline arrives and the diamonds disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bobbie Faye Sumrall is back in fighting form in this second installment of crazy, wacky adventure through Cajun country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
