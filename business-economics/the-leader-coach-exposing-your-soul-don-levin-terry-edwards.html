  <title>The Leader Coach: Exposing Your Soul - Don Levin, Terry Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leaders today come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and creeds.

While certainly still a manager and a leader, the role of Leader Coach is all about the special relationship that develops between Leader Coach and Player through the art of effective communication. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By developing your team (players) through the use of the &lt;strong&gt;Social, Performance, and Developmental Conversations&lt;/strong&gt;, a Leader Coach can help release achievement drive and enhance performance in their players.
