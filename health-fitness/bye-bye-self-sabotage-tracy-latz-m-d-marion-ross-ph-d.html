  <title>Bye-Bye Self-Sabotage! - Tracy Latz M.D., Marion Ross Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bye Bye SelfSabotage
by Tracy Latz &amp; Marion Ross
Dr.s Latz and Ross lead you on a wild journey toward your own personal transformation by mindfully applying concepts in neuroscience, quantum physics, and a combination of proven techniques and practices to blast through the obstacles blocking your path. The authors define the shrinks greatest hits (a.k.a. the 12 Keys) - the core issues that create chaos, stress and lack of joy in your relationships, health, career and life. In the opening of the book, Dr. Bernie Siegel, author of Love, Medicine and Miracles, says The lessons to be learned from this book are age-old but re-framed in ways that are easy to incorporate and appropriate to our lifestyle today. They ring true for me.
This book gives profound, easy-to-use practices that allow the readers to rapidly transform their lives! Dr.s Latz and Ross are called The Shift Doctors because in this book you will find:
The Neuroscience behind Self-Sabotage and why it has been so difficult for you to create lasting change
Bulleted, targeted recommendations at the end of each chapter to show the most rapid way to overcome issues that affect your health, emotions, relationships, finances, and career along with real-life examples of how others have shifted their lives using the tools in this book.
An intensive personal healing journey allowing you to shift your perception and situation for a jump start in life
A reference guide to be consulted one chapter at a time whenever a specific issue or challenge arises and stalls forward momentum in your life.
For anyone truly serious about changing any long-established dysfunctional emotional patterns, thoughts or behaviors that have them stuck, Bye Bye Self- Sabotage is the answer!" />
