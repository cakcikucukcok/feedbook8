  <title>Another Part of Me - Edwing Guilloteau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Another Part of Me is my second inspirational book of poetry. It covers a variety of topics on resilience, mindfulness, mutual love, faith, paradoxes, dreams, and includes a poem dedicated to the undocumented hands. My first book of poetry, Afflatus, is available through Xlibris.com and was published on December 2014.
	This new poetry book is a ballade of spirituality, psychology and philosophy. I was inspired to be rather than to seem. Take my poetic words as an expression of my guilty pleasure to connect us to one another with love and knowledge of our own moment in life." />
