  <title>Fourteen Fraught Fables and One Debatable Day - Merritt Abrash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        As suggested by the title Fourteen Fraught Fables and One Debatable Day, this book is composed of two independent parts.  The fourteen fables are brief
        subjective tales, some which might be called surreal, others simply fantastic, but all of them bizarre
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        products of a rare imagination.  They take place in a world which seems at first very like our own, but which by the end of each has altered into
        something disconcertingly unexpected.  A characteristic example: through sheer will power, the narrator rides his exercise bicycle off its stand and
        into realms he had never dreamt of.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                The longer work, One Debatable Day, tells of the humorously narrated quest by Valentinevery much of an Everyman in his virtues and
        shortcomingsto find out what the particular day of the story should be about.  This proves more difficult than he (or the reader) might have thought,
        since Valentines commitment to simple honesty and his respect for sincerity in relationships are shared by few of the wide range of people he
        encounters.  Not until he has shaken himself free from exaggerated aestheticism, political hypocrisy and self-serving religious formulations does he
        finally gain insight into what the day should be about, aided by a presumed guardian angel and a movie-buff cavalry horse.  His search is fulfilled in
        extended episodes of original humor, both high and low, playing out against the background of the desire of every human being to understand how each of
        ones days ought to be lived.
    &lt;/p&gt;
