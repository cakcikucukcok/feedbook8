In some cases, he will be called upon to alter a specific event. In others, he must save lives. A chip implanted in his brain will allow him to fit easily into any era, people, or place.
With his mission in hand, Jeremiah wakes up in 1863 as Major Trevor Tompkins, a Union soldier during the Battle of Gettysburg. He crosses paths with a nurse in the trenches, Miriam Klark, and it becomes apparent that she is the person he has traveled to save. He must save not only her life but also save her mind from the horrors of war.
Despite his secret mission, Trevor becomes personally involved with Miriam. As romantic feelings flourish between them, the battle continues to ragebut Miriam has questions. Trevor must protect her at all costs but keep his identity secret, too. Will she trust him long enough to stay alive, or will she try to escape from the mysterious man she has come to love?" />
