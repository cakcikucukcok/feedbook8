  <title>Dracula&#39;s Guest and Other Weird Stories - Bram Stoker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Dracula&#39;s Guest and Other Weird Stories&quot; is a collection of short stories that includes &quot;Dracula&#39;s Guest,&quot; &quot;The Judge&#39;s House,&quot; &quot;The Squaw,&quot; &quot;The Secret of the Growing Gold,&quot; &quot;A Gipsy Prophecy,&quot; &quot;The Coming of Abel Behenna,&quot; &quot;The Burial of the Rats,&quot; &quot;A Dream of Red Hands,&quot; and &quot;Crooken Hands.&quot; Among the most captivating of these tales is &quot;Dracula&#39;s Guest,&quot; which is widely believed to be the first chapter of Stoker&#39;s original &quot;Dracula&quot; manuscript. A young Englishman is restlessly wandering about Munich before traveling to Transylvania. When he foolishly leaves his hotel and explores a dense forest, he finds a graveyard with an evil ghost, endures a snowstorm, and has a surprising encounter with a wolf. This volume also includes the novella &quot;The Lair of the White Worm,&quot; a horror story which revolves around Adam Salton, a native Australian invited to England by his only surviving relative, Richard Salton. All seems well until he meets the neighbors and discovers a cruel mesmerist, an enormous kite, a violent woman with unknown designs, and a colossal white worm seeking victims near its pit. Fans of &quot;Dracula&quot; will delight in this fine collection of horror stories by the same author." />
