      <meta name="description" content="When Dusty, a runt piglet, is entered into a competition at the county fair, his best friend Oliver Wendell Rodent plots to go along. The little mouse insists that Dusty will need protection and will need someone to keep him company.   Oliver stows away on Farmer Joe&#39;s truck and arrives at the county fair with Dusty. The two friends learn something has been stolen and the fairgrounds are closed for the day. Someone has run off with Miss Nellie&#39;s cheese. Everyone believes the rat did it, and Oliver is the main suspect. He is determined to clear his name and find the real culprit. Oliver&#39;s new friend, Mook, a monkey, wants to help, but he is chained to a chair to prevent his escape.   Can Oliver and Dusty help Mook get free, or will their plan lead all three into danger? Dusty must compete for a blue ribbon while trying to prove his friend is innocent of the crime and at the same time help Mook escape." />
