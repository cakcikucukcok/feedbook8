  <title>Cool Waters to Thirsty Souls: Letters to Missionaries from Pastor Don Ohm Lighthouse Baptist Church - Pastor Don Ohm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book title, Cool Waters to Thirsty Souls, is based on Proverbs 25:25 &quot;As cool water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.&quot; While serving on a church staff in Wichita, Kansas, Don married his lovely wife, Deborah, in November, 1969. The young, newlywed couple surrendered to full time Christian service together at a 1969 New Year&#39;s Eve service. Ever since then, missions and missionaries have been as important to them as the church families they have led. Years ago, Pastor Ohm began sending letters of encouragement to the workers in the fields. Now for the last eighteen years, the letters still continue to go to the missionaries from his desk at Lighthouse Baptist Church, San Antonio, Texas. Pastor Ohm has been the senior pastor at Lighthouse since May of 1999. To the foreign and domestic missionaries and to all other readers, may this collection of letters be like a cup of cool water on your journey. May Jesus Christ be glorified." />
