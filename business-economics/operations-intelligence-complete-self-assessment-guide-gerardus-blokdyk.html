What are your current levels and trends in key Operations Intelligence measures or indicators of product and process performance that are important to and directly serve your customers?  in other words, can we track that any Operations Intelligence project is implemented as planned, and is it working?

Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
