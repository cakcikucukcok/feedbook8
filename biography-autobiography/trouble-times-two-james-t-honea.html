  <title>Trouble Times Two - James T Honea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As children, James and John were inseparable. They did everything together, including things Texas Panhandle townsfolk probably didnt appreciate. The good thing, though, if ever one of them was suspected of doing something wrong, the other could stand up and play alibi. In fact, the other could even stand in and take the punishment if need be, because James and John were identical twins.
On a winter day in 1956, the birth of these boys was something of a miracle. Their tiny town would never be the same, especially as the boys grew into their nicknamesThe Terrible Twosome, The Sons of Thunder, or The Daring Duo. For James and John, these werent just nicknames; they were ways of life, as they set off on world-wide adventuresone in the navy and one as a firefighter and paramedic. 
No matter the distance between them, the twins had an unshakable connection, built on a lifetime of strong family support. It wasnt always easy raising two boys, but with unconditional love, the Honea family made it happen. Being a twin is like no other experience on earth, and being a Honea twin is even more exciting. Through danger, adventure, and brotherly love, the ties of family kept them together." />
