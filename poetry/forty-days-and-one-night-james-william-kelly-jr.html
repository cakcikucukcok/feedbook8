  <title>Forty Days and One Night - James William Kelly Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forty Days and One Night is a compilation of poems intended to be used as a motivational aid in the writings of other poets from the novice on up. This collection is a sample of examples of different poetry types and styles. Rhyming, non-rhyming, happy, sad, simple, complex (multiple rhyming schemed), haiku, romantic, faith based, and story poems are the bulk of this set of examples. The straightforward eight syllable poem or &quot;eight syllablur&quot; has been included to point out how simple and repetitive this form can be. Complex multiple rhyming schemed poems are the highlight of this collection and are each very different from one another. The intent here is to encourage poets to be original and explore new and unique writing styles.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well written poem should compare to the sounds of children playing, the wind in the trees, and the music made by tires on a distant highway. These sounds and others should bring pen to paper inspiring one to turn black and white into a vibrant rainbow of words. As there is/are good and bad music, stories, and feelings, there are also good and bad poems. Write, rewrite, read, and reread, don&#39;t be satisfied with average or mediocre writings. The poet is the writers writer specializing in arranging words in more than just a readable format but in a vividly colorful and musical way without the paint brush or the orchestra. When a poem is completed it should be flawless and fulfilling to the author. Feelings will flow as well as the words.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection consists of three groups of poems. The first is a set of eighteen poems titled &quot;A Love Story&quot;. Inspired by life&#39;s rollercoaster ride through love and heartbreak. It classically begins with boy meets girl and a shared romantically passionate love. A love filled with hopes and dreams that could last forever if not for the promiscuous desires of a selfish young man. The pain and anguish felt by him is heart wrenching and ends with him as a lonely old man filled with fond memories and a relentless quest for love and passions of the heart. A life filled with good intentions, selfish mistakes, and a lust for love tainted at times leaving this man old and lonely. Throughout his life&#39;s story death is mentioned in seven of the eighteen poems, he is heartbroken to the point of suicidal contemplations, yet he drives onward. Though at times life can sometimes seem like a downward spiral there is always something to live for or look forward to and thankfully he realizes this before it is too late.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part two is a set of worldly writings with an emphasis on the wide variety of topics to pen poems about. There are so many inspirations, yet so little time. Easily an entire volume could be written about God or love but, expand the imagination into a world of talking frogs, children playing, flowing waters, disease, and laughter. Put yourself in the shoes of a man being released from prison or a poor rich man walking home in the rain. Dream, imagine, feel. Express all of this and more with the mere stroke of a pen. Give this magical, mystical form of self expression to the world, responsibly and lovingly. Share what is within you with those who surround you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we all believe in something and so our beliefs are written so that they may be shared with others. We write about what we believe in hopes that some good will come of it and so I share my faith both lovingly and passionately. I believe what I believe as well as you believe what you believe. My intentions aren&#39;t to push you or persuade you into, or convince you to change what or who you are. I am only sharing what I have faith in. I will admit though that I do hope and pray the best for everyone and that these poems of faith were written for all of you as well with that intent. I love you all and I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
