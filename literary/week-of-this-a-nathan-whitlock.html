  <title>Week of This, A - Nathan Whitlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A brilliant, darkly comic, and startlingly honest novel, A Week of This follows the lives of an extended family over one increasingly desperate week. At the centre of the novel is 38-year-old Manda, a tough, sarcastic woman who has yet to make peace with the town she was brought to as a teenager after her parents&#39; messy divorce. Her estranged mother is crazy, her father is ill and in retreat, her damaged older brother is growing restless and distant, her stepbrother is a grown-up teenager without any real friends, and her husband is a tight-lipped, depressed store-owner who has been pressing Manda to have a baby.
Full of barbed dialogue and hilariously deadpan descriptions of family dynamics and the kind of awkward social dances that get performed every day, A Week of This is a book for people who always feel a little out of place, right where they are. People who are smart enough to know something has gone wrong, but can&#39;t figure out how to fix it. People who know they aren&#39;t kids anymore, but are not quite ready to grow up.
&quot;A Week of This is bleak, funny, sad, smart, and unlike any novel I have ever read. The lives of these characters are so richly imagined I could taste the furnace dust, smell the backed-up sewer, feel the thump of every hangover. It&#39;s an authentic, unsentimental literary experiment that doesn&#39;t read like an experiment. Nathan Whitlock has exposed the timeless heart of lower-middle-class everywhere.&quot; - Todd Babiak, author of The Book of Stanley and The Garneau Block." />
