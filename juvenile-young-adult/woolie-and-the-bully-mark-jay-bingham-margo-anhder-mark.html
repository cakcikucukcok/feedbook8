  <title>Woolie and the Bully - Mark Jay Bingham, Margo Anhder Mark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mary is excited because today is Show and Tell at school. Marys innocent little lamb, Woolie, has a beautiful pink bow and excitedly, is ready to go with Mary to visit the kids at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stage is set for a lively day as Woolie clip-clops down the classroom aisle and settles into a seat, ready to show off in front of Marys class. All is going splendidly until the class is called out for recess and Woolie encounters Tommy Leland Hupp, a bully who quickly knocks the little lamb right off her feet! But when the kids gather for a ball game and Mary hits the ball, it is Woolies turn to run. As she tears around the bases and heads for home plate, the schools worst bully ever, strikes again. But what happens next is a big surprise for every one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Woolie and the Bully &lt;/i&gt;is a heartwarming childrens tale that shares an important message for students around the world that sometimes all a bully really needs is someone to believe in him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
