  <title>Twenty-Nine Tales - James Howerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You dont talk like God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How do you know? Have you ever once talked to Me? What do you want Me to do, start throwing a bunch of thees and thous at you? Im not the threatening kind, Andy. But you owe Me a favor. And it would be better to pay it than not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Oh, Please! Andy crawled off the couch and got to his knees. He clasped his hands in supplication. Please, just leave me alone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Get off the floor, Andrew. Get off your damn knees. And stop folding your hands in front of you, it creeps Me out. Ive had a stomach full of people whimpering on their knees, believe you Me. I never made people to be on their knees, they somehow learned it on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andy stared up at the bumpled-white ceiling. Whats the favor you ask of me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Its a small thing, the voice said. I want you to rescue my daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andy stared at the ceiling. Then he scrambled off the couch and staggered into the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Andy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I need a drink. Maybe four or five. Oh, God! He touched his chest, heard his heart pumping too hard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drink until I pass out and this goes away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Are you talking to yourself, or Me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What? Rescue your...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The daughter of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
