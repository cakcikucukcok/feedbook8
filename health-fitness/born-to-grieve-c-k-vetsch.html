      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its difficult to comprehend that babies are brought into this world with the predestination to grieve. It seems unbelievable that an unborn child or a newborn baby could be set up to grieve and carry that burden throughout a lifetime. In Born to Grieve, author C. K. Vetsch explains how this can happen, shares these peoples stories, and offers hope for their situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using her personal experiences as an unwanted child as a background, Vetsch explores the emotional abuse of unwanted children, the loss of a child, adoption, and abortion, among others, and discusses the consequences and the impacts. In each chapter, she presents general examples and offers a personal or specific anecdote to illustrate the effects and how one may heal from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Born to Grieve, Vetsch helps those affected to look at their lives from a viewpoint of strengths rather than weaknesses. She communicates how its time to put down the burden and find wholeness in body, mind, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
