  <title>Pieces of the Past - Jamie Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The past is closing in on Christine Scott. Uprooted from her pleasant life in Chicago, she and her two children are thrust into the Witness Security Program when the mistakes of her husband catch up with him. He lands in prison, while she and the kids are transplanted to a quiet Kansas town. Christine does her best to keep life normal for her active ten-year-old son and persistently moody seventeen-year old daughter. But when they start receiving gifts from an anonymous sender, reminders of their old life, it becomes obvious that someone has found them. Doug Jackson&#39;s been in service with the US Marshal’s office for fifteen years. He hasn’t lost a witness yet, and doesn’t intend to start with Christine or her family. If he can get them to cooperate, his job might be easier. Unfortunately, no one seems concerned about making Doug&#39;s life easy. Not the man in the white sedan who eludes him, nor the pretty Christine, thoughts of whom he can&#39;t seem to shake. Their lives depend on Doug keeping his head in the game, and he&#39;s determined to do just that." />
