  <title>Oh God! Mrs. Easton - J.R. Shane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every young man dreams of finding an older woman to teach him about sex. Mrs. Easton was a young man&amp;#39;s dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I sat silently, reasoning that nothing I had to offer would be of interest to her. After she emptied her glass and returned from the kitchen, she sat next to me again and took a sip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do you know why you&amp;rsquo;re here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I hope I know, but you can still tell me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love young men. They have no agendas other than getting laid, and they won&amp;rsquo;t break my heart. They have the most amazing cocks that get hard again in a few minutes, and I can train them to do whatever I want. Quite frankly darling, I&amp;rsquo;ve popped more young men&amp;rsquo;s cherries than probably any other woman in the county.&amp;rdquo; She looked at me after taking another drink. &amp;ldquo;Does that offend you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; I had no idea even what to think.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Some of the self-righteous bitches around here have nasty names for me but that still doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop their sons from coming to see me.&amp;rdquo; She paused to take another sip of her drink. &amp;ldquo;Are you a virgin?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Er...I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Does what you did last night count?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not at all. You have to bury yourself inside and leave it there until it shoots. That counts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about time that we took care of that, do you agree?&amp;rdquo; She finished her drink and put the glass on the end table. &amp;ldquo;Take your clothes off. Do it slowly and stop when I tell you.&amp;rdquo;" />
