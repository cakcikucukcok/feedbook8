  <title>The Philanthropist - Adrian Cattermole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They call him The Philanthropist, but nobody knows his real name or his identity. Despite his mystique, one thing is for sure: he has a lot of money and uses it well, making surprise gifts to people in need at an alarming rate. The donations are good for the news, as is this modern day Robin Hood, but people still ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would he give away so much money anonymously? What does he get out of it? His gifts are always unannounced, but the recipients are never shy to make the gifts known, each seeking their own fifteen minutes of fame as the media would then descend. Everyone agrees: its a nice distraction from politics, war, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who is The Philanthropist? How has he managed to keep his identity a secret for so long, and where has all this money come from? The questions are asked, but the hidden hero seems unlikely to make an appearance. This is the secret history of an elusive man, inspiredindeed, obsessedwith giving his money away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
