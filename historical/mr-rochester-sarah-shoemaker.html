  <title>Mr. Rochester - Sarah Shoemaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A CRACKING-GOOD READ!&quot;-- &lt;i&gt;People, &lt;/i&gt;Best New Books&lt;br&gt;  A deft and irresistible retelling of Charlotte Bronte¿s beloved classic Jane Eyre--from the point of view of the dashing, mysterious Mr. Rochester himself.&lt;br&gt;  For 170 years, Edward Fairfax Rochester has stood as one of literature&#39;s most complex and captivating romantic heroes. Sometimes cruel, sometimes tender, Jane Eyre&#39;s mercurial master at Thornfield Hall has mesmerized, beguiled, and, yes, baffled fans of Charlotte Brontv¿&#39;s masterpiece for generations. But his own story has never been told.&lt;br&gt;  We first meet this brilliant, tormented hero as a motherless boy roaming Thornfield&#39;s lonely corridors. On the morning of Edward&#39;s eighth birthday, his father issues a decree: He is to be sent away to get an education, exiled from all he ever loved. Young Edward&#39;s journey will take him across working-class England and the decadence of continental Europe before he lands on the warm, languid shores of faraway Jamaica, where his inheritance lies.&lt;br&gt;  That island, however, holds secrets of its own, and Edward soon grows entangled in morally dubious business dealings and a passionate, whirlwind love affair with the town&#39;s ravishing heiress, Bertha Antoinetta Mason. Eventually, in the wake of a devastating betrayal, Edward must return to England with his increasingly unstable wife to take over as master of Thornfield. And it is there, on a twilight ride, that he meets the stubborn, plain young governess who will steal his heart and teach him how to love again.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Mr. Rochester&lt;/i&gt; is a sweeping coming-of-age story and a stirring tale of adventure, romance, and deceit. Faithful in every particular to Brontv¿&#39;s original yet full of unexpected twists and riveting behind-the-scenes drama, this novel will completely, deliciously, and forever change how we read and remember &lt;i&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/i&gt;." />
