  <title>Stuck With You - Christina Mandelski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Caleb Gray heads to the Texas coast to mentally prepare for a future he isn&#39;t sure he wants, the last person he expects to see is Catie Dixon. Yeah, their mothers have been planning their wedding since they were born, but he and Catie are most definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; friends. He can&#39;t see her as anything but the annoying kid who followed him everywhere. Except, it&#39;s &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; bothering him that everyone is staring at her in that bikini...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Catie got over her crush on Caleb ages ago. So why can&#39;t she see past his ripped body or how unsettled he seems? She&#39;s got her own problems, though. Her future has been set for years and now she&#39;s dreaming of pulling the plug. A week at their families&#39; beach house is just what she needs to pull herself together, and she has no intention of letting Caleb back into her heart...which would be a whole lot easier if he&#39;d put on a shirt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a forced week of togetherness full of beach parties, &lt;br&gt;waterslide mishaps, bonfires, and roller coasters sparks more than an understanding. What do you do when the person standing in the way of your future is the one person you grew up hating...but now don&#39;t?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains summer thunderstorms on the beach, an, er...awkward waterslide incident, and an infuriatingly hot boy who you&#39;ll no longer be able to ignore.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the First Kiss Hypothesis series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The First Kiss Hypothesis&lt;br&gt;* Love and Other Secrets&lt;br&gt;* Stuck With You&lt;/p&gt;" />
