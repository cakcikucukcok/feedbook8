  <title>Night Embrace - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;br&gt;Life is great for me.  I have my chicory coffee, my warm beignets, and my best friend on the cell phone.  Once the sun goes down, I am the baddest thing prowling the night: I command the elements, and I know no fear.  For centuries, I&#39;ve protected the innocent and watched over the mankind, making sure they are safe in a world where nothing is ever certain.  All I want in return is a hot babe in a red dress, who wants nothing more from me then one night.&lt;br&gt;Instead, I get a runaway Mardi Gras float that tries to turn me into roadkill and a beautiful woman who saves my life but can&#39;t remember where she put my pants.  Flamboyant and extravagant, Sunshine Runningwolf should be the perfect woman for me.  She wants nothing past tonight, no ties, no long-term commitments.&lt;br&gt;But every time I look at her, I start yearning for dreams that I buried centuries ago.  With her unconventional ways and ability to baffle me, Sunshine is the one person I find myself needing.  But for me to love her would mean her death.  I am cursed never to know peace or happiness-not so long as my enemy waits in the night to destroy us both.&lt;br&gt;--Talon of the Morrigantes&lt;/p&gt;" />
