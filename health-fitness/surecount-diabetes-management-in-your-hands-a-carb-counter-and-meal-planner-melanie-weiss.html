      <meta name="description" content="Eat Carbs With Confidence! It is important to eat about the same amount of carbohydrates during each meal or snack to keep your blood glucose levels within a targeted range. But you may wonder what foods contain carbohydrates and in what amounts? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SureCount provides the information you need to make informed carbohydrate choices for successful diabetes management.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you have prediabetes, gestational diabetes, Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, or just want or need to maintain a consistent, regulated carbohydrate intake at mealtime, SureCount provides a quick and easy reference guide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SureCount is also valuable for those who care and cook for diabetics as it functions as a diabetes meal planner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SureCount offers a practical and ordered listing for hundreds of every day carbohydrate foods within these 12 categories:&lt;br&gt;Dairy, Cereals, Grains, Juices, Dried Fruits, Fruits, Beans, Vegetables, Snack Foods, Sweets, Free Foods and Combination Foods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every food item is standardized to 1 carbohydrate serving (15 grams of carbohydrates). This makes it easy to quickly choose foods and portion sizes that are within your health provider&amp;#39;s recommendations for daily carbohydrate intake at breakfast, lunch, dinner and even when choosing snacks between mealtimes." />
