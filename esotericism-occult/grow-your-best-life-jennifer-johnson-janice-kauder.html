  <title>Grow Your Best Life - Jennifer Johnson, Janice Kauder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Jennifer Johnson, a treasured member in one of my possibility posses. Shes wise, kind and she says good stuff. I hope you enjoy her inspiration as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;
- Pam Grout, #1 NY Times Bestselling author of E-Squared, Thank and Grow Rich, and 15 other books&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Jennifer Johnson&#39;s book Grow Your Best Life is delightful! Her gardening metaphors for your life will support you in your growth if you follow her simple and practical exercises. This is one personal development book you will easily read all the way through and maybe over and over again.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- Jay Pryor, Speaker, Author, Executive Coach,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaypryorcoaching.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.jaypryorcoaching.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;When my friend of over 30 years asked me to illustrate her book, I was honored. As we collaborated on the images that would convey each chapter&#39;s message, Grow Your Best Life became a magnet encouraging me to illustrate in a new way--with my heart--to visually portray the wisdom and loving kindness that Jennifer embodies in her life and in her book.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- Janice Kauder, fortunate friend, gardener, and illustrator&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you sometimes feel fabulous, uplifted, and powerful; like you are dancing with the Divine? And other times you feel crummy, overwhelmed, and frustrated? In Grow Your Best Life, Jennifer Johnson uses her own life experience to guide you along the path of life&#39;s journey to get and stay happy. She supports you in feeling good by providing a simple structure, practical tips, uplifted thinking, and baby-step exercises to help you stay in step with the Divine. Youll want this book if:&lt;br /&gt;
- you want to feel good more of the time&lt;br /&gt;
- you like simple, practical help&lt;br /&gt;
- you want to gift a friend with beauty and wisdom&lt;/p&gt;" />
