  <title>THIS WAY TO CHRISTMAS - Stories for when you&#39;re snowed in at Christmas - Ruth Sawyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During WWI, one Christmas, a young boy finds himself stranded in a snowed-in hill community in upstate New York, and finds himself experiencing a Christmas he is not accustomed to. He meets a &amp;quot;locked-out fairy&amp;quot; who introduces him to equally lonely neighbours, all of whom were also spending the winter far from home, and each tells him a personal story of the Christmas season. Some stories the neighbours heard in their native homelands long ago.&lt;br /&gt;
A final celebration brings all the neighbours of different nationalities together, forging relationships that will outlast the holiday season and sending a message of hope to a war-torn world.&lt;br /&gt;
Suitable for reading to children aged up to 8 or as a gift to young readers aged 9 and up.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit is donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
