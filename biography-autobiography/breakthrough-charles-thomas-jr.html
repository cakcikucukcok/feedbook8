  <title>Breakthrough - Charles Thomas Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Breakthrough: Stories of Resilience, Tragedy, and Triumph captures the lived experiences and collective wisdom of individuals from varied walks of life. The trials, tribulations, and battle scars that we all don are not meant to be hidden. They should be embraced and shared with the world. Life is but a fleeting moment. Regardless of how long we live, it will not be long enough. As such, it is advisable to smile, have fun, live, learn, enjoy the life journey as much as possible, and break through whatever is holding us back from being the best version of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout Breakthrough, you will have the blessed fortune to learn about and incorporate the wisdom of some remarkable human beings who have experienced a variety of breakthroughs in their lives, are enjoying their journeys, and are successful, based on their own definitions. You will receive advice that will dramatically amend your perspectives on success, achievement, philosophies of life, love, and leadership, and many of the principles necessary for the full engagement and active participation in your life journey. You will learn the elemental importance of not allowing who you are to stop you from becoming who you want to be. The stories and themes of hard work, failure, resilience, learning from others, asking for help, leading from where you are, etc., are most inspirational. I am confident that the insights provided within these pages will offer you value and help you as you prepare or continue to offer useful service as a servant to many.&lt;/p&gt;" />
