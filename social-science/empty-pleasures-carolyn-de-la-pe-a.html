  <title>Empty Pleasures - Carolyn de la Pe単a</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sugar substitutes have been a part of American life since saccharin was introduced at the 1893 World&#39;s Fair. In &lt;i&gt;Empty Pleasures&lt;/i&gt;, the first history of artificial sweeteners in the United States, Carolyn de la Pena blends popular culture with business and women&#39;s history, examining the invention, production, marketing, regulation, and consumption of sugar substitutes such as saccharin, Sucaryl, NutraSweet, and Splenda. She describes how saccharin, an accidental laboratory by-product, was transformed from a perceived adulterant into a healthy ingredient. As food producers and pharmaceutical companies worked together to create diet products, savvy women&#39;s magazine writers and editors promoted artificially sweetened foods as ideal, modern weight-loss aids, and early diet-plan entrepreneurs built menus and fortunes around pleasurable dieting made possible by artificial sweeteners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NutraSweet, Splenda, and their predecessors have enjoyed enormous success by promising that Americans, especially women, can &quot;have their cake and eat it too,&quot; but &lt;i&gt;Empty Pleasures&lt;/i&gt; argues that these &quot;sweet cheats&quot; have fostered troubling and unsustainable eating habits and that the promises of artificial sweeteners are ultimately too good to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
