  <title>Ameher&#39;s  No More Crumbs Chronicle of a 4-D Woman Rising from Hate to Hope - Ameher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It took discipline and practice for me (soul, body and spirit) to be intertwined with the presence of the HOLY SPIRIT completing this 4-dimensional existence here enabling me to achieve this state of WISEMIND amidst trials and tribulations; preparing me for greater things. The Chakra as the Hindus call it is the centering of all these factors creating an implosion or explosion or quietness in spite of the surrounding circumstances and/or experiences inflicted upon by ourselves or others.
We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6:12 has been the theme and focus throughout this book. Wrestling one thing after another but through it all I took ...to me the whole armor of God, that I be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Standing therefore, having my loins girt with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and my feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all taking the shield of faith, wherewith I am able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And taking the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints Ephesians 6:13-18.
Its a story of an immigrant woman finding her place in society and maneuvering old ways of thinking that created enslavement i.e. capitalism without conscience. Her transition from immigrant slave to heir, owning a piece of the pie and the share of the American Dream is inspiring yet provoking to young people, especially those of immigrant extractions and pedigree who find themselves giving up on their dreams due to hardships and challenges of being termed the immigrant." />
