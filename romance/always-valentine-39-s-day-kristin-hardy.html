  <title>Always Valentine&#39;s Day - Kristin Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had his ship finally come in?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Christopher Trask, it was beginning to  look that way. Though his professional life might be a shambles, his Valentine&#39;s Day family reunion on the high seas was looking most promising&amp;#151;especially once he met fellow passenger Larkin Hayes. The beautiful &quot;it&quot; girl was there to keep an eye on her often remarried father. But Christopher couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larkin was suspicious of Christopher from the start&amp;#151;and her father falling for his aunt was certainly complicating matters! Still, a cruise ship wasn&#39;t real life&amp;#133;and Christopher could kiss her senseless. So what was the harm in a little holiday fun? Surely her common sense would return once she was back on dry land&amp;#133;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
