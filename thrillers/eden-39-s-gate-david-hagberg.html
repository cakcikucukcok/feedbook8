      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A wall has gone up and come down since the end of the Second World War, and Germany is once again united. As Berlin rebuilds, the German authorities ask the U.S. for help. Ex-Stasi Captain Helmut Speyer is wanted in his homeland for crimes committed in East Germany under the communist regime. And now Speyer and his group of commandos are up to something in their Montana compound-something that has Germany looking over its shoulder in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former National Security agent Bill Lane and his wife mount an operation to stop Speyer and his commandos. Racing him to the infamous bunker Reichsamt 17, the site of some of the Nazi&#39;s most horrific experiments, Speyer is after one of the deadliest weapons ever made. A race for time with Washington D.C. the hostage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
