  <title>BBW Romance - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frantic after getting fired, BBW Marisa Jamison is relieved when she&amp;#39;s offered the perfect job at a prestigious law firm. There, she meets charismatic billionaire, Jeffrey Bradley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s only one problem...he&amp;#39;s so sleazy that she wonders if the job is even worth it. Even so, she fantasizes about having mind-blowing sex with him and gets all sweaty at the very thought of him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curvy girl Marisa knows that Jeffrey isn&amp;#39;t interested in her &amp;quot;type,&amp;quot; and would never give her a second look. She&amp;#39;s always been self-conscious about her weight, and has yet to find a guy who loves her for her sensual curves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s something about Marisa that Jeffrey can&amp;#39;t resist, and he becomes obsessed with her. Big girls have never been his thing, but ever since they met, he craves her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is his desire for Marisa simply the result of a workplace crush, or is he hiding a scandalous secret that could jeopardize their well-being?&lt;br /&gt;
