  <title>LUST Classics: Fanny Hill - Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure - D. H. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following the death of her parents, a young and innocent Fanny Hill travels to London to find work. She has barely arrived, however, when she is lured into a brothel and has a sexual experience with another woman. A costumer gets her out of there and becomes her lover, but a whole new world has opened to Fanny, who sets out to explore all the pleasures her body has in store for her.
Considered the first prose pornography ‘Fanny Hill - Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure’ (1748) is one of the most prosecuted and banned books of all time. It has often been quoted in popular culture, in Tom Lehrer’s song &quot;Smut&quot; and in an episode of ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circis’ to name a couple.
