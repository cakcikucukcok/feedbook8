  <title>3point8 - Michael Melilli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve heard that when you&#39;ve lost everything, you finally see who you really are.  If that&#39;s true, then I&#39;m not sure I like the thing at the core of myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It scares me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve lost my wife. She&#39;s not dead, but she might as well be-locked in a coma that she&#39;ll never be free from. My daughter is gone too-taken from me before I even had the chance to hold her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They told me she&#39;s dead, but I&#39;m not so sure anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve started seeing things, dark creatures, I feel their taint in the air and the way they make the world feel off . . . wrong. Everyone says it&#39;s all in my mind, that it&#39;s just grief. They say I&#39;m overwhelmed by the sorrow and the loss and that someday it&#39;ll all be better again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe they&#39;re right, or maybe I&#39;m just losing my mind. These things I&#39;m seeing can&#39;t be real; monsters aren&#39;t supposed to exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if they do, then they have my little girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there&#39;s even a chance that my daughter is still alive, then I need to find her. No matter what anyone says. No matter what it takes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter what kind of man it turns me into." />
