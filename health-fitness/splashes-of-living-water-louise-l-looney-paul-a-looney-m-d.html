  <title>Splashes of Living Water - Louise L. Looney, Paul A. Looney M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is your spirit thirsty for peace or does your heart yearn for bubbling springs of joy? Splashes of Living Water invites you to stand under Gods waterfall of grace until your spiritual and emotional reservoirs overflow into the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories of victory and defeat will bring laughter and tears as you relate to those who struggle in their attempts to meet basic needs. Profound insights flow from these life experiences and Gods Word when you accept His invitation to drink Living Water and quench that thirst forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise has brilliantly uncovered and revealed the original psychology book. You wont be able to put this book down. Her questions and solutions through life-examples allowed me to examine my motives and bring my hurts to Jesus for healing.&lt;br /&gt;
Vilet Weaver, author and marketing specialist&lt;/p&gt;
