  <title>The Stop Doing List - Matt Malouf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Learn what &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to do to grow your business&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Stop Doing List&lt;/i&gt; gets you off the treadmill of unproductive, frenetic activity, and sets you on the path toward growth. Running a business has never been easy, but today&#39;s nonstop 24-7-365 world makes moving forward more difficult than ever before. Plenty of resources can show you how to make lists, create schedules and manage your time, but they all seem to expect your time to be 100 per cent devoted to work – not only is that no way to live, it&#39;s no way to &lt;i&gt;grow&lt;/i&gt;. Instead, try doing less. This book shows you how to stop wasting energy on tasks that don&#39;t move you closer to your goals, so you can focus on the things that do. You&#39;ll identify your own Stop Doing list, and learn a systematic and practical way to eliminate, automate or delegate these tasks so they never end up on your To Do list again. You&#39;ll discover your personal path to business success, develop a winning mindset and forever change the way you run your company – and along the way, you&#39;ll gain the freedom, energy and time you need to take back your life. &lt;p&gt;Author Matt Malouf has helped businesses around the globe – from $20M+ corporations to start-ups – achieve their growth objectives. Now, he shares his proven strategies with you: it&#39;s not about doing more; it&#39;s about doing what matters. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find your inner genius and use it to grow your business&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Switch your mindset to one of success&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Attract, train and retain the people you need&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make lasting changes to the way you think about your business&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it seems like the more you do, the less you achieve, it&#39;s time to stop and breathe. Get smarter about growth and start developing &lt;i&gt;The Stop Doing List&lt;/i&gt;." />
