  <title>Hidden Ivies, 3rd Edition, The, EPUB - Howard Greene, Matthew W. Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Completely revised and updated with a dozen new colleges and universities, the essential guide students need to help them choose and gain admission to the outstanding schools that fit them best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Howard and Matthew Greene&amp;#8217;s years of counseling experience and research, &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Ivies&lt;/em&gt; is an invaluable, in-depth look inside sixty-three renowned academic institutions. These private colleges and universities offer students a broad liberal arts education that will help them build a strong foundation for the rest of their lives. The Greenes help families understand what makes an Ivy League college so desirable, and why these Hidden Ivies (some less well-known than others) offer an educational and personal experience to rival that found on Ivy campuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this fully revised and updated edition&amp;#8212;featuring new institutions, including Dickinson College, Fordham University, and Southern Methodist University&amp;#8212;the premier educational consultants and authors of &lt;em&gt;Making It Into a Top College&lt;/em&gt; take you school-by-school, revealing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why these are unique institutions of exceptional merit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What criteria to use in evaluating different programs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The admissions requirements for each selective school&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to approach the selective college admissions process today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Student perspectives on their college experiences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The value of pursuing a liberal arts education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing a college is one of the most important decisions every student&amp;#8212;and their parents&amp;#8212;will ever make. With costs rising and so many to choose from&amp;#8212;and the competition for acceptance more intense than ever before&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;The Hidden Ivies&lt;/em&gt; offers invaluable insights and advice to help every student choose and apply to the right school: the place where they will thrive, academically, socially, and personally.&lt;/p&gt;" />
