  <title>Where the Heavens Kiss the Earth - Rabbi Karmi Ingber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where the Heavens Kiss the Earth is a comprehensive, transformative, enlightening book that reveals the deepest mysteries of life in an entertaining, user-friendly way.
The purpose of life, fate, destiny, free-will and a grand plan, the spiritual universes, body and soul, and more, are explained from the perspective of the great Kabbalists, elucidated with analogies, metaphors and stories that open us up to the profundity of these topics. 
Through the eyes of the mystical wisdom, we can finally get a handle on the inner workings of our world, our being, and how to attain happiness. 
At the end of each chapter, Rabbi Ingber brings theory into action with exercises and practical applications to transform these life enhancing ideas into our daily reality. 
This book is sure to enlighten your mind, inspire your heart and awaken your soul.
I commend Rabbi Ingber for this masterful work and recommend it to all those that want to make their lifes journey in this world more meaningful, significant and purposeful. 
-Rabbi Zev Leff,  Rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva,  Moshav Mattisyahu
Rabbi Ingber presents very challenging concepts in ways that both scholars and laypeople can understand. He provides multiple examples from varied perspectives to elucidate constructs and ensure a deep understanding of the most profound human questions. As such, one finds oneself pulled into each chapter yearning to know more...Thank you for this gift.
   -Dr. Julie Ancis,  Associate V.P. Georgia Institute of Technology, APA Fellow
A penetrating look into the mysteries of the universe by a charismatic, funny, gracious, and knowledgeable teacher. Reading this book was like having a long and enthralling conversation with one of the most talented teachers and scholars of Jewish Mysticism today.
    -Joseph Skibell,  Author, Winship Distinguished Professor Emory University
Where the Heavens Kiss the Earth presents complicated areas in Jewish Philosophy in a clear, pleasant and rational manner, that can be easily understood by all who wish to. It is easy to read and enjoyable, yet so profound and accurate.
