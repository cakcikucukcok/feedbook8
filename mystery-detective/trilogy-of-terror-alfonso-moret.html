  <title>Trilogy of Terror - Alfonso Moret</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Roman and Elsbone were veteran animal trappers and hunters. They were warned by the Chalukyas tribesmen that the Devil Dogs were ferocious and did not fear
    man or any other animal. The hunters were experienced predators and huntsmen and knew that the wild beast that the tribesmen were leery of were just
    Himalayan tempestuous wolves. The Chalukyas tribesmen disclosed to the hunters that they had seen two Devil Dogs bring down a huge wild boar and tear it
    apart one evening at the base of the Mahila Mountains. It is known amongst hunters and wildlife individuals that no wild animal/beasts or man want any part
    of the violent desolate fierce boars; these Devil Dogs were fearsome and vicious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The major deciding factors that finally made the huntsmen want to seek and capture the wolves were these main issues: One, the Los Angeles zoo was offering
    a large amount of money for two legendary Devil Dogs from India. The second aspect was they heard that a single Devil Dog had fought and killed a Siberian
    Tiger; this factor increased their inquisitiveness and curiosity of this sensational beast and its folklore. Their egos also played a part in their
    judgment to capture the animals
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    An element they had to contemplate and had caused them concern was that they were told that the beast only come out after the sun has set. Nightfall, this
    is an advantageous factor for the nighttime predator. So these beasts were nocturnal hunters; this was not an odd characteristic for any wolf, but still it
    was a concern for the hunters. All these tidbits of information just enticed Roman and Elsbone even more, and it heightened their hunting and ego desires.
    The two English veteran hunters were now traveling toward their prey and compensations as they were now heading toward the foothills of the snowcapped
    Himalayas, the hunting grounds of the Devil Dogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The huntsmen eventually had left their regular and familiar stomping grounds of South Africa years earlier because of the civil turmoil that continues to
    cause chaos and havoc with many of the unsettled tribes and conformed city dwellers. The other object and issue was now there are all the new restrictions
    and hunting laws causing hardship on hunters and trappers, also there were the conservation laws protecting the wild beast limiting them even more. Elsbone
    and Roman left Africa and went and took their trade to South America. But after some time, they grew tired of the humid atmosphere, the different language,
    and customs along with the constant damp eerie rain forest. So now they were here in India following the harsh rumors of the ferocious wild Devil Dogs that
    killed cattle, pigs, and villagers and nowthey also heardeven killed mountain lions. The hunters journey did have some hardships. They needed to travel
    far through hot rough desolate deserts with very cold nights.
