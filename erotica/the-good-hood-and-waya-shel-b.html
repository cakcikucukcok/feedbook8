  <title>The Good Hood and Waya - Shel B</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tommy, the oldest of the group, being fifteen and also the biggest one of the group, stood up. With an exaggerated low bow toward Trance announced sarcastically, ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you, The Good Hood. He has indicated previously that he would beat anyones ass who seriously hurts someone, he wants all female members to be treated with respect. Now he wants us to clean up the place and take a bath. 
Everyone laughed until Trance started walking toward Tommy, then it was like everyone turned to stone, no one moved, not a sound was heard. Trance stood so close to Tommy that all he could see was Trances eyes glaring into his. Trances eyes had turned from brown to bright peridot green. Tommy was so startled that he let out a roaring scream. 
Slowly and quietly everyone started picking up the debris and putting it in the dumpster. 
When they were finished, they all took off their clothes down to bare butt and ran as a group, with Tommy in the lead, and dived into the river water. Kelly brought a bar of soap and passed it around as they splashed and played and were enjoying it as children do when they are forced to take a bath, like its hard to get them in the tub and harder to get them out. 
When everyone was dressed and huddled around the fire, Trance stood and said, I have one more thing to say. Forced sex is a definite no in this pack, consensual, fine with me, but no one is to sexually assault anyone else in this or any other gang. There will be no rape among us. 
The girls all clapped their hands and cheered, the boys said nothing." />
