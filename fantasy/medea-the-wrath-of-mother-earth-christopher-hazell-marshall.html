  <title>Medea: The Wrath of Mother Earth - Christopher Hazell-Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Che-Avana is gone, lost long to the Immortals who desperately seek him. Time sleets by, ever strengthening the hand of the Void, bringing ever closer the moment when the Song is broken forever. Far distant from the world that Che-Avana knew as home, Medea, Mother Earth, rages. Every bite of flame and pick axe is a torture to her, every man and woman who walks upon her is an abomination. She wreaks her hatred on those who struggle to survive, unwittingly condemning them to the hardest of lives. Amongst the turmoil two lives entwine unwillingly together, at first driven by the need to survive, but eventually with the understanding that they hold the key to unlocking the greatest secret in the world. And of Che-Avana? He has his own battles to fight against an evil that stalks him through the Everdark." />
