  <title>The Man in the White Linen Suit - David Handler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next clever, witty, and touching installment in the Edgar award-winning Stewart Hoag mystery series&amp;#160;finds the beloved ghostwriter-sleuth&amp;#160;and his faithful neurotic basset hound, Lulu, back in 1990&amp;#8217;s New York City, investigating a bestselling author&amp;#8217;s stolen manuscript and three murders linked to the crime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Washed-up celebrity ghostwriter Stewart &amp;#8220;Hoagy&amp;#8221; Hoag has finally rediscovered his voice and is making progress on what he hopes will be his long-awaited second novel. Burrowed up in his less-than-luxurious, sweltering fifth floor walk-up, he tries not to think of the disparities between himself and his ex-wife, celebrity actress Merilee Nash, who is sifting through film offers&amp;#8212;and also her fickle feelings for Hoagy&amp;#8212;from her elegant eight-room apartment looking over Central Park. When Merilee offers her home for Hoagy&amp;#8217;s use&amp;#160;while she&amp;#8217;s shooting on location, hope blossoms that he might finally get some real work done&amp;#8230; and solidify their rekindling romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Hoagy receives a call from his literary agent asking if he can meet with publishing&amp;#8217;s most ruthless and reviled editor, Sylvia James,&amp;#160;for a drink at the Algonquin Hotel. After disclosing that aging literary genius Addison James&amp;#8212;also Sylvia&amp;#8217;s father and main client&amp;#8212;has not in fact written his last two bestselling historical sagas, Sylvia reveals her suspicions that Addison&amp;#8217;s assistant Tommy O&amp;#8217;Brien&amp;#8212;the true author&amp;#8212;has run away with their most recent manuscript and is holding it for ransom. Tempted by Sylvia&amp;#8217;s offer to bid a hefty advance for his novel-in-progress, Hoagy agrees to help unearth Tommy&amp;#8217;s sudden disappearance. If only he&amp;#8217;d known&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;exactly&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;what he was getting himself into, he might&amp;#8217;ve saved himself from the ensuing grief that follows in his hot pursuit of Tommy. But then, that wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a normal day in the life of Hoagy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clattering claims of a mugging, a stolen manuscript, and three murders, now it&amp;#8217;s up to Hoagy and his short-legged sidekick Lulu&amp;#160;to unravel this baffling, bizarre case.&lt;/p&gt;" />
