  <title>The Eight Principles of Doing Business with Collaboration in the Earth - Ralph S. Collymore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book should be read by sole proprietors, LLCs. Private corporations, public corporations, SMEs, NGOs, church leaders, and leaders of nations. This book is timely for our world that is going through perilous times. The title of the book is The Eight Principles of Doing Business with Collaboration in the Earth. Collaboration is normally considered when national disasters prevail. Our world has been going through financial disasters, social disasters, and health disasters. As a result, the nations of the world, whatever size or status, must embrace collaboration as proposed in this book. Gen. 4:69 (NKJV) records how we may behave.
6) So the LORD said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?
7) If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.
8) Now Cain talked with Abel his brother;  and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
9) Then the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know. Am I my brothers keeper?
This book offers through the Word of God that we are our brothers keeper. When we do business in the earth, we must choose collaboration to replenish the earth with the eight principles: benefit, uniqueness, strategy, innovation, necessity, execution, success, and sustainability." />
