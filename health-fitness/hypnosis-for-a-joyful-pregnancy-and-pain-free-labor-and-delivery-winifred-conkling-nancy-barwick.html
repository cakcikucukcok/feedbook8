Will my pregnancy be difficult? Will my labor be painful? Will I be a good mother?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Hypnosis for a Joyful Pregnancy and Pain-Free Labor and Delivery&lt;/i&gt; will not be able to provide answers to all of the unknowns, this unique and innovative book can teach you how to lessen the common complaints of pregnancy and ease the pain of childbirth. Step-by-step, you will learn how to use hypnosis to induce a state of calm and comfort during any stage of the journey.
