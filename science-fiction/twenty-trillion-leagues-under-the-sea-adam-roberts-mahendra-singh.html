On board, gathered together for the first time, are one of the Navy&#39;s most experienced captains and a tiny skeleton crew of sailors, engineers, and scientists. The &lt;i&gt;Plongeur&lt;/i&gt; makes her first dive and goes down, and down and down. Out of control, the submarine plummets to a depth where the pressure will crush her hull, killing everyone on board, and beyond. The pressure builds, the hull protests, the crew prepare for death, the boat reaches the bottom of the sea and finds nothing. Her final dive continues, the pressure begins to relent, but the depth gauge is useless. They have gone miles down. Hundreds of miles, thousands, and so it goes on. Onboard the crew succumb to madness, betrayal, religious mania, and murder. Has the &lt;i&gt;Plongeur &lt;/i&gt;left the limits of our world and gone elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;" />
