  <title>Bone Dust White - Karin Salvalaggio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Someone is knocking at the door to Grace Adams&#39; house, and he won&#39;t stop. Grace thinks she knows who it is, but when she goes to her second floor window for a look she sees a woman she doesn&#39;t recognize. The woman isn&#39;t alone for long before a man emerges from the dark of the surrounding woods, stabs her, and leaves her for dead. Trying to help, Grace goes to the woman and is shocked to find that it&#39;s her mother Leanne--a woman who abandoned her 11 years before. There&#39;s nothing she can do, and Leanne is already past the point where she can tell Grace what happened all those years ago or why she came back now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Grace was only a child when Leanne left her, Detective Macy Greeley has been waiting for Leanne ever since she disappeared from Collier, MT. She&#39;s looking to close a case that has been haunting the town for far too long, but Collier is a hard-bitten place where the people are fierce when it comes to keeping their feuds between themselves and keeping secrets hidden in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karin Salvalaggio&#39;s outstanding crime fiction debut Bone Dust White is an absolutely stunning work that signals the entrance of a major new talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
