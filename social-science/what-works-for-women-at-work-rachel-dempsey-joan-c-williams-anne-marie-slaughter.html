Authored by Joan C. Williams, one of the nation&amp;#8217;s most-cited experts on women and work, and her daughter, writer Rachel Dempsey, this unique book offers a multi-generational perspective into the realities of today&amp;#8217;s workplace. Often women receive messages that they have only themselves to blame for failing to get ahead&amp;#8212;Negotiate more! Stop being such a wimp! Stop being such a witch!&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;What Works for Women at Work&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;tells women it&amp;#8217;s not their fault. The simple fact is that office politics often benefits men over women.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Based on interviews with 127 successful working women, over half of them women of color,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;What Works for Women at Work&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;presents a toolkit for getting ahead in today&amp;#8217;s workplace. Distilling over 35 years of research, Williams and Dempsey offer four crisp patterns that affect working women:&amp;nbsp; Prove-It-Again!, the Tightrope, the Maternal Wall, and the Tug of War.
