  <title>Beauty School - Lisa Marie Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are a few teachers who I will always remember in my life. Lisa Marie is someone who makes the world a better place with love, kindness and enthusiasm. I will always be grateful to have had Lisa Marie as a teacher. 
Nate Hall, Graduate from the Aveda Institute Las Vegas
Lisa Marie is a true inspiration, role model, mother, beauty professional, teacher, as well as entrepreneur. From the moment I met Lisa my world changed I knew I met a powerhouse and what I did not know was that powerful women would soon be a role model for me someone to aspire to be and great friend. I met Lisa Marie at work where we both taught cosmetology not only did she guide me at work but she taught me life lessons. By watching her I learned how to be a stronger woman by working by her side. When Lisa Marie needs to be serious she can be but I can always count on her to make me laugh. Its an honor to call her role model and friend. 
Candace Harker, Owner of Prodigy Hairdressing
Lisa Marie is an amazing mentor and leader. I had the incredible opportunity to work with her and she taught me so much. She is the type of leader I would love to one day be. Thank you for all your magic!! 
Angelo Denofrio, Master Stylist &amp; Colorist
&quot;Sharing knowledge and experience is the things that Lisa Marie does on a daily basis, with a goal to ensure everyone succeeds. I know the powerful lessons that she presents will continuously inspire. &quot;
