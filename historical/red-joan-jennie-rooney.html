  <title>Red Joan - Jennie Rooney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Currently being adapted to film starring Oscar-winner Judi Dench and actress Sophie Cookson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by the true story of Melita Norwood, a woman unmasked in 1999, at age 87, as the KGB&#39;s longest-serving British spy, &lt;i&gt;Red Joan&lt;/i&gt; centers on the deeply conflicted life of a brilliant young physicist during the Second World War. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talented and impressionable, Cambridge undergraduate Joan Stanley befriends the worldly Sonya, whose daring history is at odds with Joan&#39;s provincial upbringing. Joan also feels a growing attraction toward Leo, Sonya&#39;s mysterious and charismatic cousin. Sonya and Leo, known communist sympathizers with ties to Russia and Germany, interpret wartime loyalty in ways Joan can only begin to fathom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As nations throughout the continent fall to fascism, Joan is enlisted into an urgent project that will change the course of the war&amp;mdash;and the world&amp;mdash;forever. Risking both career and conscience, leaking information to the Soviets, but struggling to maintain her own semblance of morality, Joan is caught at a crossroads in which all paths lead to the same end-game: the deployment of the atomic bomb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life during wartime, however, is often ambiguous, and when&amp;mdash;decades later&amp;mdash;MI5 agents appear at her doorstep, Joan must reaffirm the cost of the choices she made and face the cold truth: our deepest secrets have a way of dragging down those we love the most." />
