  <title>Their Lordship&#39;s Toy - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rose was a young and innocent maid, but her world is now one of lust and depravity. Her Master has corrupted her, and now intends to take her to a party where wickedness and sin are the main attractions. Alone in a four-poster bed, Rose must pleasure any Lord who takes a fancy to her - and she is to prove extremely popular...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The light filtering through the curtains stung my still-sleeping eyes - and the incessant chiming of the clock didn&amp;#39;t help much either. Though I knew it would stop soon enough, I was still more than tempted to hurl a heavy object at it and cease its noise manually. Lord Evans was nowhere to be found - of course, he was a busy man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t expect to wake up by his side every morning, but the lack of warmth at my side was somewhat alarming. Only ten days had passed - but our relationship felt lengthier than that, somehow. We had been through quite a bit together, far more than conventional couples. Even though it had only been ten days, I felt as though we might as well have been together for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two days ago, he had whisked me away to a depraved sort of gathering - many men had done unspeakable things to me, and it was then that I came to the stark realization that Lord Evans was a man of incredibly strange tastes, and those tastes were unwavering. I was still nervous, still skeptical, but there was no denying that I had enjoyed being used as nothing more than an object." />
