  <title>At Last; They’Re Here! - Ed Wooddell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At Last; Theyre Here! is a human drama with a science fiction backdrop. It poses the question of how Earth would react to the knowledge that an alien space ship is heading toward our planet and ample time was available to prepare for its arrival. &lt;p&gt;
Matt Anderson, a nave but brilliant astronomer, creates just such a scenario when he discovers a space ship on target for Earth. Almost immediately, political and military power-brokers the world over set into motion conflicting agendas. Some of the planned actions are based on serious scientific and national security concerns, but some are aimed at personal gain and ambition. &lt;p&gt;
Matt is ill prepared for the turmoil that ensues, especially when political machinations begin to recreate the Cold War. But these actions must be countered while he and his supporters pursue peaceful contact with the ship. Almost beyond Matts ability to comprehend, rogue military and unscrupulous political leaders are bent on the ships destruction, especially as the aliens come dangerously close to Earth with still no contact established. &lt;p&gt;
The all too fragile and corrupt human emotions poised against dogmatic scientists as they seek to resolve what may be the greatest event in human history lead to international confrontations, public panic and personal tragedies that reveal the best and worst in the human character." />
