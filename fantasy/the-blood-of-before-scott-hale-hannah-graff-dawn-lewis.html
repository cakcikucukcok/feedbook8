  <title>The Blood of Before - Scott Hale, Hannah Graff, Dawn Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Blood of Before&lt;br /&gt;
by&lt;br /&gt;
Scott Hale&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
is an anthology of six interconnected horror stories that take place before The Bones of the Earth series.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A mother, called across the Victorian countryside, to return to her family estate and the violent lineage she left behind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The writings of a supernatural investigator sent to explore a village where people die day by day, and the dead refuse to stay buried.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A college graduate, recently fired and drowning in debt, who agrees to babysit her former professor&amp;rsquo;s child&amp;mdash;unaware she might become the boy&amp;rsquo;s new favorite plaything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The egotistical writer of a self-published, self-indulgent horror magazine who follows a lead to a house where a family was murdered, and the murderer who still resides there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the depths of a swamp, children are seen carrying body parts to an island covered in satin, and the woman who lies at its center, gorging herself on their fleshy tributes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A family fractured by hate and distrust come to discover that the grandfather clock they&amp;rsquo;ve purchased is chiming out madness at the midnight hour, causing their love and hate to come together in one hideous, parasitic union.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the darkest violence to the blackest humor, The Blood of Before is a glimpse into the horrors that led up to the Trauma and continue to affect the world of The Bones of the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If The Blood of Before doesn&amp;#39;t make your heart stop...&lt;br /&gt;
you&amp;#39;re already dead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
