  <title>Heart Awakening - Alan F. Zundel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Heart Awakening&lt;/I&gt; is the story of how a young man&#39;s pursuit of love becomes a journey into spiritual awakening. Set during the cultural and spiritual confusion of the early 1970s, it captures the experience of suburban young people searching for deeper meaning in their lives.&lt;/P&gt;
Carl Lehrer has grown cynical after a failed relationship and nearly being drafted. He falls for Sharon Belmont, whose openness to new spiritualities launches him on a personal journey involving meditation, spiritual teachers, and a psychic premonition about their future. Carl&#39;s quest for love and truth eventually leads to a breakthrough experience beyond anything he could have imagined.&lt;/P&gt;
What Readers Say:&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;It&#39;s great-really stays with me. Good opening scene and powerful ending.&quot;-Jane Schaberg, Detroit, Michigan (author of &lt;I&gt;The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene&lt;/I&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;Reading it was a spiritual journey in itself!&quot;-Andy Turner, Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;Definitely has heart. Captured well the dialogue of young people on a spiritual odyssey.&quot;-Elizabeth Prince, Oakland, California&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;Enjoyed it very much-liked the story, and the meditation sequence was pivotal, really satisfying.&quot;-Michael Mangin, Huachuca City, Arizona&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;Liked the ending-satisfying, but realistic. Some of the scenes were really funny!&quot;-Theresa Farmer, Henderson, Nevada&lt;/P&gt;" />
