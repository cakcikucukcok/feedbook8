  <title>Colton&#39;s Ranch Refuge (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Coltons of Eden Falls, Book 2) - Beth Cornelison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;‘You know nothing about the real me.’&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-soldier Gunnar Colton’s only focus is shaking off the horrors of war in his remote cabin – until a murderer abducts another victim from the neighbouring Amish community. Then the Colton code of honour kicks in and it’s his duty to protect the eyewitness who’s the next likely target.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Treating sexy, spitfire actress Violet Chastain as just another assignment is next to impossible, though. There’s more to her than Hollywood. The minute Gunnar lets the starlet and her twin baby boys into his home, the guard around his heart starts to crack. One taste of passion shows him the future he can have with Violet – if the threat closing in doesn’t claim them both.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The Coltons of Eden Falls: Love and justice know no boundaries&lt;/em&gt;
