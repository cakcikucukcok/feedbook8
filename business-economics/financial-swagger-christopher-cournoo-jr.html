  <title>Financial Swagger - Christopher Cournoo Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book started out as a journal reminder. I was in a state of reflection, looking back on my financial achievements and errors. I began to realize that when I achieved financial success, I followed a set of guidelines that Ive been able to rely on throughout my adolescence and adult life. When I made errors and failed, I didnt follow those guidelines. I somehow neglected to connect the dots until I started to just capture my thoughts in a journal. These thoughts were for me to read and make a practice of so that I wouldnt conveniently forget when I needed to recall them the most.
I realized quickly that a lot of these practices are not discussed openly, and more importantly, I realized that the information that I was writing down for me could help many others. I have always wanted to do something to help people financially, and this is the first step. A set of seven primary principles that, when practiced regularly and incorporated into daily thinking and living, will have great impact to many.
This book is a guide. Its a map. The true journey begins when you read the map and take the first step. There will be more financial discoveries along the way. I wrote for an easy read. I believe in simple brilliance. Lengthy reading has a way of losing people. We live in such a fast-paced world in which new information is out around the clock, and many times, we overcomplicate things because the content goes against the pace and flow of the world we live in. This book aims to provide the right blend of information and stay in sync with the pace of the world, fast but plentiful." />
