  <title>&quot;You Are Unique&quot; Aren&#39;t You? - Kumar Vuppala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You Are Unique  Arent you ? 
Biologically it is quite clear that everyone is Unique, right from the birth.
We are told that the human genome is a string of some 70 billion pairs of protein molecules arranged in different sequences. Of course, as I understand it, many parts of the sequence are more or less fixed, but there is still a lot of room for a seemingly infinite number of combinations and permutations that determine individual characteristics.
According to the author in todays day and age of competition where everything is a click away on the net from jobs to businesses, you are Unique Arent You? Is no longer just an adjective but an essential skill to be successful in the corporate world? In the present day Personal Branding is not only for celebrities or artists but is getting increasingly essential for everyone as the web is going more social. Personal Branding is about you telling the world your unique characteristics. 
Everything we say or do now-a-days can potentially end up being on the World Wide Web. However it is possible to contain these to an extent through Online Reputation Management (ORM) with the amount of dependency we have on the internet, lack of positive ORM can be potentially make or break a business or a career. Positive ORM helps monitor a person, company or a brand on the web have maximum visibility of positive information, suppressing any negatives.
Social Media biggest revolution after Sir Timothy John &quot;Tim&quot; Berners-Lee invented internet. Social Media has made large network of people from around the world interact, hang out with each other, share interests, network and even find jobs and promote businesses through their personal profiles, making it essential to question not whether IF but WHEN you should start using them." />
