  <title>Tectonic Plates - How the World Changed - an Elementary Introduction to World - Wide Tectonic Plate Migrations Over 750 Million Years - Peter Roberts  BSc MSc PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a fascinating and intriguing book that tells the geological story of the world over the last 750 million years.  The object of this book is to simplify a complex and very specialised subject so that it can be presented clearly and briefly.  The author presents fourteen briefly-explained plate migration maps of the entire globe, showing the approximated movements and positions of the world&#39;s major tectonic plates over the last 750 million years. This gives &quot;the big picture&quot;, explaining how and why our climate has changed so radically with time.  This book has been written and the maps drawn for beginners, night classes, schools, universities, amateur geologists, climatologists and even for professional geologists.  It is for anyone who wants to understand the causes of the huge changes in the world&#39;s geology, oceans, and climate, which have taken place long before humankind evolved, and which have, in turn, created and moulded our planet&#39;s diverse geographical landscapes." />
