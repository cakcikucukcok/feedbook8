  <title>Ozzy Knows Best - Chris Nickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Always outrageous but equally compelling, &lt;i&gt;Ozzy Knows Best &lt;/i&gt;is THE book to have on Ozzy, MTV&#39;s The Osbournes, and everything in between.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Osbournes: children Kelly and Jack, mother Sharon, and the father, none other than Godfather of Metal Ozzy Osbourne. Starring in MTV&#39;s most popular show ever, the Osbournes have proven that the family of a heavy metal superstar can teach America what parenting is all about with their new twist on family values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s made Ozzy into such a great father? Experience. You name it, he&#39;s done it. He&#39;s bitten the heads off doves and bats, urinated on the Alamo (while wearing a woman&#39;s dress!), and been addicted to drink and drugs. With his first band, Black Sabbath, he practically invented heavy metal. As a solo performer, he&#39;s sold millions of albums, and helped turn the annual Ozzfest tour into one of the biggest events in music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how Ozzy went from being banned at the Alamo to a guest at the White House, from bats to Beverly Hills. It&#39;s all in here, with plenty of trivia-like why oldest daughter, Aimee, didn&#39;t want to be a part of series- and all the parenting tips any father needs to be as good a dad as Ozzy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
