  <title>Swan Maiden - Sharon Margolis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="800 A.D.
Rescued by her half-brother from enforced confinement by Charlemagne in the convent in Verden, Kara is brought to the safe haven of the Harz Mountains, and to the care of Bertagard the Priestess. There she learns that she was marked by the pagan gods at birth to fulfill a prophecy. Her destiny to help her conquered Saxon people lies in the valley blow, on the estate where she grew up, now occupied by the enemy Franks.
Count Gerin the Faithful is the newly appointed count of the region, and hes tasked to enforce the law of Christian conversion. He arrives with the intent to conquer by force until an enchanting earthbound Valkyrie teaches him to love. Kara is coerced to wed the hated Frankish lord. She is torn between loyalty to her people and a growing love for her husband. Together, through compromise, compassion, and increased understanding, they work to bring peace to the war-torn region.
A lavishly detailed historical epic with well-drawn characters, Margoliss novel contains an enjoyable balance of action and romance.
