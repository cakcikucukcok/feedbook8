  <title>Orphan Boys - It Takes a Village to Raise a Child - Phil Mews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1976, the hottest summer for a generation and life was perfect for the two young brothers Philip and Roger. They lived an idyllic life on a farm in the picturesque dales of the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their days spent on the farm, playing on Tarzan swings, building dens and swimming outdoors, their perfect existence was plunged into darkness when tragedy struck the family. Within a ten-week period, the boys lost their parents and were left as orphans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Philip and his brother Roger, how their grandparents stepped in to bring them up and how a family and community came together to deal with the consequences that the devastation of death had left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Orphan Boys&lt;/i&gt; is not a misery memoir. It is a story full of love, strength and hope - an uplifting tale of a family&#39;s survival and how they faced the huge challenges that life threw at them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
