&lt;p&gt;Fourteen-year-old Angie hasnt had what youd call a happy childhood. Shes never really had a home. Because of her familys financial situation, shes never lived in one place for very longuntil they found that one house, where they got to stay for eight wonderful years. Now, they are forced to leave again. This time, Angie is not only leaving a place; shes leaving her school and her best friend, Derrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parting gift, Derrick gives Angie a jade necklace so that shell never forget him. At the time, Angie doesnt realize the importance of the necklace. Shes too busy hating her new home. Forced to move in with her party animal aunt, Angie wishes for escape. Little does she know, creatures in a faraway dimension are about to grant her wish. They have big plans for young Angie, but the road will not be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Angie is taken away to this foreign dimension. Her family believes she has disappeared; in reality, she has been transported to another world, where she is surrounded by unfamiliar creatures. Now, she must discover who is friend or foe, as she travels the long, difficult path back to her own world. What does fate have in store for Angie, and will she live to fulfill her purpose in another dimension as well as on Earth?&lt;/p&gt;" />
