  <title>Pacific Wiretap - Patrick Downey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Fox is an engineering graduate student returning to a summer internship in the telecommunications industry. He has been given a copy of a Confidential letter written by an Air Force colonel on Guam that suggests a wiretap scam of significant proportion has been set up on a fiber-optic undersea cable network. One of the wiretap locations is on Andersen Air Force Base, on Guam, with other locations in California, Japan, and Hawaii. National security may be at risk, aside from theft -of-service. Jonathans task is to determine how the wiretap scam was established, by whom, and for what purpose. He is assigned to work inside the companys cable station on Guam, ostensibly to fine-tune cable equipment, but quietly snoops on the technicians, a task he finds necessary but distasteful. On his second day on Guam he is invited out to Andersen, where he finds the colonel who authored the Confidential letter to his company has been murdered. As Jonathan pursues his investigation he finds the wiretap arrangement has been established for a very intriguing purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action in Pacific Wiretap creates a scene of adventure, crime, and daring that spans the Pacific Ocean itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
