  <title>Dry Water - Robert J.C. Stead, Neil Querengesser, Jean Horton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dry Water&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Donald Strand, from the time of his arrival as a ten-year-old orphan at his relatives’ Manitoba farm in 1890 to his apogee as a successful farmer. It recounts the crises he faces during a troubled marriage and the great stock market crash of 1929. His life parallels the growth and development of Manitoba during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stead considered &lt;i&gt;Dry Water&lt;/i&gt;, written in 1934–1935, to be his crowning achievement. He was unable to find a publisher for it during his lifetime, although an abridged edition was published by Tecumseh Press in 1983. This new edition includes the complete typescript, a critical introduction, and explanatory notes that place this novel in its proper literary and historical context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
