  <title>Younger by the Day - Victoria Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful to love your life through every age and stage of it? Appreciate yourself every step of the way? And have such vitality that, even though you&#39;re perfectly proud of the age you are, people routinely think you&#39;re several years younger? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happy state is the promise of Younger by the Day, a one - year program for aging in reverse with results that start as soon as you do -- and you can start any day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria Moran was baffled when midlife seemed to change everything, from the shape of her body to her visibility in society. She began a four - year journey, asking these questions: Why do some women blossom with age while others wither? How can you accept yourself as you are and still nurture yourself into becoming the best you can be? How can you draw from your inner wisdom everything you need to deal with the un-certainties of life as well the certainty of growing older?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria found the practical answers, and they are distilled here for you to put into use, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
