        &lt;p&gt;Men of Honour Collection – 7 Amazing Lori Foster Novels&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ready, Set, Jett by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ready, Set, Jett&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A vacation from her no-strings romance with her sexy next-door-neighbour. That’s what Natalie Alexander needs to get her head—and heart—together. But her solo trip south turns into a disaster when gorgeous Jett Sutter turns up with another challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When You Dare by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tougher they are, the harder they fall.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Professional mercenary Dare Macintosh lives by one hard-and-fast rule: business should never be personal. If a cause appeals to him and the price is right, he’ll take the mission he’s offered. But then the lovely Molly Alexander asks him to help her track down the men who’d had her kidnapped—and for the first time, Dare’s tempted to combine work with pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trace of Fever by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE OF VENGEANCE AND DESIRE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Undercover mercenary Trace Rivers loves the adrenaline rush of a well-planned mission. First he’ll earn the trust of corrupt businessman Murray Coburn, then gather the proof he needs to shut down the man’s dirty smuggling operation. It’s a perfect scheme—until Coburn&#39;s long-lost daughter saunters in with her own deadly plan for revenge. But one wrong move, one lingering embrace will expose them to the wrath of a merciless opponent….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Savor the Danger by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The one woman he couldn’t have was the only woman he desired…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She may be aloof, and more pretty than gorgeous, but Alani Rivers is the kind of woman a hot-blooded mercenary can’t forget, no matter how hard he tries. So when Jackson Savor wakes up next to the naked, sleeping beauty—with no memory of what happened—he knows he’s been drugged…even if Alani doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jackson swears he’ll move heaven and earth to keep Alani safe. But what really happened that night? And will the truth bring them closer than they ever thought possible—or put Alani squarely in harm’s way again?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A Perfect Storm by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He never saw her coming…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spencer Lark already knows too many secrets about Arizona Storm, including the nightmare she survived and her resulting trust issues. But in order to expose a smuggling ring—and continue avenging his own tragic past—the bounty hunter reluctantly agrees to make Arizona a decoy. Yet nothing has equipped him for her hypnotic blend of fragility and bravery, or for the protective instincts she stirs in him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What Chris Wants by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the going gets tough, the tough turn to Chris Chapey. As the right-hand man to a group of take-no-prisoners mercenaries, Chris can organize a top-secret rescue mission with his eyes closed. But when it comes to his personal life, Chris is the one who needs a little help. His problem: Matt Houser.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matt challenges Chris to change his life–and make a place for him in it. Can Chris risk telling him the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bare It All by Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A cop’s craving to know more about the woman next door could prove fatal, in the steamy new novel from New York Times bestselling author Lori Foster&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the person responsible for taking down a brutal human trafficker, Alice Appleton fears retaliation at every turn. No one knows about her past, which is exactly how she prefers it…until the sexy cop next door comes knocking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What is Detective Reese Bareden goal? To unmask Alice’s secrets? Or to protect her from a dangerous new threat? One thing is certain: their chemistry is a time bomb waiting to explode.&lt;/p&gt;
