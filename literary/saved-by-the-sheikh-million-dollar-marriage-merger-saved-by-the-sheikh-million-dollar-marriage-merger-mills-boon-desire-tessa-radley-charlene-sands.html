  <title>Saved by the Sheikh! / Million-Dollar Marriage Merger: Saved by the Sheikh! / Million-Dollar Marriage Merger (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Tessa Radley, Charlene Sands</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Be swept away by passion… with intense drama and compelling plots, these emotionally powerful reads will keep you captivated from beginning to end.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Saved by the Sheikh!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Practically penniless, Tiffany Smith had nowhere to turn except to the gorgeous billionaire who offered his help. Dashing banker Rafiq Al Dhahara did not believe she was an innocent fallen on hard times. Still, his distrust didn’t stop her from falling for his charms…and into his bed for one passionate night.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Million-Dollar Marriage Merger&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He’d kept a promise to marry his best friend’s widow. But nothing could diminish the hunger vintner Tony Carlino still felt for Rena Montgomery. Rena married Tony only for the safety his name – and money – would give her, her winery…and her unborn child. Never would she allow herself to reveal the desire she felt for her new husband. For their marriage was meant to be only about business.&lt;/p&gt;
