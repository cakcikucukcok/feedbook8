      <meta name="description" content="Dare to enter a hidden world where the powers of nature and the supernatural are forced to coexist. Where the whale and the elephant are not the largest creatures on earth, and cadaverous shadows can assume any physical form! Come and share the startling adventures of three extraordinary children: a powerful warrior, a master of sorcery, and a beautiful princess, predestined from birth to exonerate their king, their country, and the entire world against Gath, the most powerful troll in all creation!
Stolen from their cribs as babies by an iniquitous dwarf and flogged into bondage to a hideous hag, the youngsters escaped only to be found and raised by a host of Cavern Elves. Young Hemlock and Gomorrah were thoroughly trained to undertake an epic confrontation in which all life upon the earth hanged in the balance!
With the princess kidnapped and only seven days remaining to rescue her, the two friends, with the aid of their amazing pets Goliath the dragon and Scurge the tarantula, must embark a desperate and perilous crusade to find the one weapon they must possess to slay that roaring beast from the world undergroundthe Scorpions Claws!" />
