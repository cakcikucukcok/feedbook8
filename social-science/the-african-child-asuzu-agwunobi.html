  <title>The African Child - Asuzu Agwunobi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The African Child author tells it as it happened from the harrowing childhood experience to the ups and downs of his adulthood in the African capital cities and the rural typical village. The interesting mix of hard work and faith in Gods Providence makes for an exhilarating reading that challenges African policy makers. The authors critical assessment of the Nigerian crisis in the mid sixties soon after Independence as he places blame on both sides of the conflict depicts the writers sense of impartiality to be encouraged by political leaders particularly in Africa.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book examines thoughtfully the various stages in human development and finds no excuse in the down trodden level of the black man from his native land in Africa to his imposed second home anywhere, particularly in the United States. In the closing chapters the book exposes the hardship, the loss of human dignity and personal exploitation of all black people from the days of the slave trade till today. The book challenges the conscience of world leaders and calls for Reparation for slavery and colonialism. Besides, the author seeks to inculcate the spirit of self respect in all African people maintaining that self respect is the smoothening oil for human dignity while chastising all races of mankind to judge a person not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character, as Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. admonished.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a must read for all civil rights activists, college young students and world leaders and politicians.&lt;br&gt; 			&lt;p&gt;Asuzu Agwunobi&lt;/p&gt;" />
