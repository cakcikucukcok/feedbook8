      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pathways&lt;/em&gt;, Leigh and Carol Adams autobiography, tells of how God led them to meet and merge their lives for the furtherance of the gospel. Pathways is based on James Fenimore Coopers novel, The Pathfinder. As a youth, Leigh enjoyed treks on Pathfinder Island in search of Indian artifacts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Leigh and Carol invite you to walk with them along the various pathways of lifes journeyeducation, marriage and the call to ministry. During their fifty-five years as missionaries with Baptist Mid-Missions, they served in Quebec (French Canada) and on college and university campus ministries.  Later, Leigh was appointed North America Field Director and Vice President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is exciting to read how God led them, by faith, to push open closed doors in order to obey the Great Commission, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. (Mark 16:15).&lt;/p&gt;
A United States Senator from which state said, Do not let the forces of evil take over to make this a Christian America?
What is the meaning of the sign PAIN in the window of a Quebec home?
Does God have blue eyes?
How is it possible to distribute tracts while surfing?
What was the reply of Notre Dame Universitys vice president when Leigh requested permission to have Bible studies on campus?" />
