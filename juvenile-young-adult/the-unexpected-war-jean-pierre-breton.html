  <title>The Unexpected War - Jean-Pierre Breton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For thirteen-year-old Lance Burns, Sunday morning of August 17, 2032, starts out like every other onean average, mediocre, not-too-great-but-not-too-shabby kind of day. Forced to spend a rainy weekend in a cramped cave during a family camping trip with his two sisters, Lance looks forward to getting back home to Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as theyre preparing to leave, meteor-like balls of fire begin crashing into the earth all around them. Lance, Kate, and Tina take refuge in the cave, and from there they witness an alien fiend unfold from the ball, roar, and head toward Dublin. Curious, Lance makes his way into the city where he is stunned to find carnage everywhere, the fiends destroying everything in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his fathers old rifle at his side, Lance accepts an invitation to join the Peoples Liberation Force, a resistance group dedicated to fighting the fiends. Together they risk their lives and battle long and hard to defeat the aliens that have taken over their world. Will Lance have to give his life to the cause as well?&lt;/p&gt;" />
