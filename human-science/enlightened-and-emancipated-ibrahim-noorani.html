  <title>Enlightened and Emancipated - Ibrahim Noorani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People hardly find time for themselves in this effervescent world where tyranny and oppression of body and mind leave their checks on daily basis. The question of Knowing thyself barely stands a chance. Being challenged by this question, Steve Gage, son of a wealthy millionaire, becomes cognizant as to what is the reason of his existence which in turn is relevant to all mankind.
Anthony Marques, a savant, introduces Steve to the mystical world of self-realization and elevates him to a place unimaginable to him. However, not being able to endure the power of this knowledge, Steve uses his gift in the pursuit of revenge and intentionally wrecks the lives of the people who are dear to him; Sarah the love of his life and Paul his best friend. But then realizing what he had done, Steve by the help of Anthony Marques tries to repair the damage he has caused to his friends. This book ventilates a tale which shows a variety of emotions including love, hate, lust, despair, revenge and curiosity.
Based in the modern times of twenty first century, against the fast pace life and fallacy of the world, Enlightened and emancipated tells the story of a young man&#39;s quest for self enlightenment and how his love for knowledge leads to the destruction of the lives of people who were close to him. From the frailties of human nature to the impeccability of divine love Steve Gage realizes the purpose of his existence and explores the mysteries of the universe." />
