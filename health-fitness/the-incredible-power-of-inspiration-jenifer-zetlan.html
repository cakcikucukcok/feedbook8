  <title>The Incredible Power of Inspiration - Jenifer Zetlan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Finding your new lifestyle&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Healthy habits and finding your new lifestyle:&lt;/b&gt; When do we actually stop and notice that our lifestyles are causing us harm? Perhaps the trigger is a diagnosis of diabetes or high blood pressure; or perhaps our relationships are troubled – or non-existent. At some point, either events or other factors give us a firm message to stop and look at ourselves and to find a better way by developing healthy habits.
&lt;b&gt;Spiritual wellness and mental wellness:&lt;/b&gt; But if we barely have time for the basics of daily living, how then do we pay attention to our physical, mental and spiritual wellness? In the rush of life, many make poor decisions, turning to alcohol or drugs. Many others experience anxiety or depression. When life continues unchecked we find ourselves in crisis: a physical, mental or spiritual breakdown. Spiritual wellness and mental wellness are critical to recovery.
&lt;b&gt;Spiritual inspiration and designing healthy habits:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;The Incredible Power of Inspiration&lt;/i&gt; looks at the story of our lives first from the outside in, from our circumstances to our feelings, and then from the inside out, from our dreams into the world. This revolutionary holistic approach to body, mind and spirit helps readers deconstruct unhealthy habits and design healthier, more vibrant lives. Zetlan’s book is an enriching journey through one’s own life - our yesterday’s, today’s and into our tomorrows. As adventurers in our own lives, we will re-vision and re-cast our life’s story through finding our deepest inspiration, our most joyful feelings and language our dreams into life. Jenifer Zetlan teaches readers to simply step through life’s challenges and stay deeply centered and excited about their journeys. We can successfully live into our fullest potential; we can re-write the script and find a new lifestyle. With this powerful method, readers can inspire their own character, re-write their story and enable themselves to live into the lives they deserve." />
