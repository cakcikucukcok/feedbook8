  <title>The Countess Of Assis — Romance, Revenge And Ambition During The Second Reign - JoÃO Paulo Foschi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Angel or demon?&lt;br/&gt;
Pretty and revengeful, the Countess of Assis is back in the conclusion of one of the most celebrated historical novels of recent years. Obsessed by her desire of revenge and taking advantage of her husband’s absence, Lorena Duarte Valão continues her plan to destroy the life of the seductive millionaire, Rafael Abrantes. However, as the scenes of intrigue come one after another, precipitated by the intrigues provoked by her mother-in-law, and in order to preserve her secret, the Countess of Assis now counts with the support of the rascal Donato Augusto Saraiva Conde, who, unexpectedly, is the only witness of the murder of the Santiago family’s matriarch. In order to fulfill her intentions, Lorena will do anything to destroy whoever tries to cross her path—her false friend Carolina and even the resigned Alma will be some of the victims of her pitfalls, culminating in an unexpected conclusion which will certainly surprise the readers.&lt;br/&gt;
Besides what it is expected from an exceptional novel of intrigue, you will embark in a travel through time, through important events of the history of Brazil, from the signing of the abolition of slavery to the end of the Monarchy, after the Republican coup of November 15th, 1889. The Countess of Assis has a plot involving hypocrisy, clash of interests and forbidden passions. It is the story of a crashed heart, when the duality of good and evil produces bitterness and suffering; a novel in which lives are radically transformed by power and love… It describes the nineteenth century like you never read before!&lt;br/&gt;" />
