  <title>Gabriel West: Still The One (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Fiona Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The breakup of her marriage had been devastating, but Tyler Laine had rebuilt her life and now moved in a world of money and privilege, a far cry from the mean streets of &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; world. And yet Gabriel West, ex-SAS agent and her estranged husband, still haunted her nights with dreams of what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then someone decided Tyler would be better off dead, and she knew there was only one man who could protect her….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For years, Gabriel had dreamed of a second chance with Tyler–so when she asked for his protection, he was more than happy to oblige. He&#39;d found a way back into her life–now if only he could find a way back into her heart….&lt;/p&gt;
