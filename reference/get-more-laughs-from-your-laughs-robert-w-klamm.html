  <title>Get More Laughs from Your Laughs - Robert W Klamm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;&lt;I&gt;Get More Laughs From Your Laughs&lt;/I&gt; is worth more than all of the 30 other comedy books in my library. Great innovations, all very usable and adaptable!&quot;-Barron Stringfellow&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;Your little book contains more practical information than the excellent books I already have by Eastman and Vorhaus. Thanks!&quot;-Bill Ligon&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;I was a basket case when it came to doing comedy, until I discovered these techniques and put them together in &lt;I&gt;Get More Laughs From Your Laughs&lt;/I&gt;.&quot;-R W Klamm&lt;/P&gt;
World-famous comedy magician, Aldo Columbini says: &quot;Every topic has been analyzed and explained. You&#39;ll find comedy contradiction, exaggeration, rules of physical action, punch-line sentence structure, dual reality, innocence and believability, timing and the pause, how to build your own comedy characterization, plus comic devices with funny examples. You&#39;ll have fun with the game-like exercises included with each chapter.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
Whether you become a comic star or not, humor can help you light the darkest corners of your life, heal the spirit, makes friends of enemies, and clear out the cobwebs that clutter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Get More Laughs From Your Laughs&lt;/I&gt; is fun to read, fun to use. You&#39;ll keep it as a reference manual. It is a gem that even professionals will treasure.&lt;/P&gt;" />
