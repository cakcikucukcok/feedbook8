  <title>Fighting for Darfur - Rebecca Hamilton, Mia Farrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Around the world, millions of people have added their voices to protest marches and demonstrations because they believe that, together, they can make a difference. When we failed to stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, we promised to never let such a thing happen again. But nine years later, as news began to trickle out of killings in western Sudan, an area known as Darfur, the international community again faced the problem of how the United Nations and the United States government could respond to mass atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Hamilton passionately narrates the six-year grassroots campaign to draw global attention to the plight of Darfur&#39;s people. From college students who galvanized entire university campuses in the belief that their outcry could save millions of Darfuris still at risk, to celebrities such as Mia Farrow, who spurred politicians to act, to Steven Spielberg, who boycotted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Hamilton details how advocacy for Darfur was an exuberant, multibillion-dollar effort. She then does what no one has done to date: she takes us into the corridors of power and the camps of Darfur, and reveals the impact of ordinary people&#39;s fierce determination to uphold the mantra of &quot;never again.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Fighting for Darfur&lt;/i&gt; weaves a gripping story that both dramatizes our moral dilemma and shows the promise and perils of citizen engagement in a new era of global compassion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
