      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Rebecca Weller&amp;rsquo;s pounding, dehydrated head woke her at 3am, yet again, she stared at the ceiling, wondering why the hell she kept doing this to herself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At 39 years of age &amp;ndash; and a Health Coach, no less &amp;ndash; she knew better than to down several bottles of wine per week. &amp;nbsp;Her increasingly dysfunctional relationship with alcohol had to stop, but after decades of social drinking, she was terrified of what that might mean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How could she live a joyful existence, without alcohol?&amp;nbsp;How would she relax, socialise, or celebrate &amp;ndash; without wine?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In sheer frustration, on a morning filled with regret and tears, she embarks on a 3-month sobriety experiment that becomes a quest for self-discovery, and ultimately, transforms her entire world. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Happier Hour&lt;/em&gt; is a memoir that moves beyond addiction, giving a behind-the-scenes look into what it takes to get (and stay) sober in a culture that celebrates alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A heartfelt, moving, and inspiring story for anyone who has ever had to give up something they loved in order to get what they truly wanted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
