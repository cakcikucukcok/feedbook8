  <title>The Most Important Questionnaire You Will Ever Take in Your Life - Julian Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;This Book was typed by me but written by The Holy Spirit. There are really only three chapters contained  The History  My Story and The Questionnaire. The best way to gain a full understanding of the content is to just read Chapter 1. It may feel like too much preaching for your taste, but it is only a set of instructions given to me by The Holy Spirit as how to gain the most from the text. Many people may consider just bouncing to the Questionnaire itself and answer the questions found there, but that is not how The Holy Spirit delivered the instructions to me, so I pass them on to you.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;The second chapter covers the History of the time when the Church needed some help, and about a man that entered the Church and asked a few questions to bring the Church back on track. Little did he know that his questions would set about changing the world of understanding The Lord and His wishes from that moment on. We still follow most of the doctrines he encouraged here in this country today.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;The third Chapter is My Story. Of how Jesus showed Himself to me and answered all of my questions, and believe me I had many. This text, this Questionnaire has changed my life forever and helped me transition from only having Faith in God to Trusting God as well and all that that entails.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;The fourth Chapter is the Questionnaire itself. It maybe to some very difficult to finish but your answers will have to be nothing but what you believe in your heart to be true the day you take it. It will be a record of your beliefs in front of Jesus Himself and any falsehood will immediately be known to Him. I believe that as you pass through this book you will see how Trusting The Lord is much more important than just having Faith. Faith brings you to The Lord and without it I believe you will never feel The Holy Spirit in your heart and soul. But Trust gives you a way to answer the questions you still have. And if you have the courage and conviction to make that step you will have a new understanding of how The Lord God Almightys plan for you works in your life and what you are expected to do to accomplish that plan. It is a big step, but the Questionnaire I believe will help you find answers to many questions you have of your own as it did for me, and all I have been asked to do is to share the enclosed with as many people as I can.&lt;/P&gt;" />
