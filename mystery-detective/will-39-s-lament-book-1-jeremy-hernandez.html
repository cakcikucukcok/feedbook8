  <title>Will&#39;s Lament: Book 1 - Jeremy Hernandez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Will&#39;s Lament &lt;/EM&gt;is a series of 4 books. It&#39;s the story of a painfully acquiescent love-triangle. Not of man and woman, but of life, death, and everything in between.It incorporates themes of several genres, including suspense, horror, fantasy, a bit of dark-humor, and a hint of criminal drama, particularly noticable as the reader progresses through the next volumes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;BOOK 1 &lt;/EM&gt;leads a man named Will Cypher through a post-apocalyptic city, flooded with sinful temptations at every turn. To find the answers he so desperately seeked : Who he was, and how he got there.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Will has absolutely no memory of himself. His only hope is a devastatingly BEAUTIFUL, yet clearly psychotic woman, whodefiles her face with black paint, in the design of a twisted and demonic looking clown. Whom kills impulsively without doubt, or hesitation. Whom claims to hold the very answers Will wanted to hear. But only seems to drive him further and further into the rut.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does he simply ignore her relentless bloodlustOr can he do it all on his own?&lt;/P&gt;" />
