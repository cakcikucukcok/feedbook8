  <title>Admiral&#39;s Daughter - Julian Stockwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the eighth book of this popular series, Thomas Kydd and Nicholas Renzi return to England in 1803 after tumultuous episodes on the other side of the world to find England in peril of starvation and bankruptcy. Kydd is placed back in command of his beloved vessel, Teazer, but he barely has time to prep her for the sea when he is sent on an urgent mission. Smugglers, enemy privateers, and treacherous sea conditions await Kydd on his journey to northern France on the eve of war, but equally worrisome events are occurring ashore. A growing attachment to the admiral&#39;s daughter curbs Kydd&#39;s blissful reunion with Teazer and he is forced to make a terrible decision that may cause the end of his friendship with Renzi—or the end of his naval career." />
