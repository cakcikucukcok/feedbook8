  <title>My Theory of Everything - Thomas L. Little  Esq.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Theory of Everything is a treatise designed around a personal spiritual experience during a near-death episode in 1994.
I was informed a major worldwide spiritual attitude change would begin in 2012.
That event happened as predicted, July 4, 2012, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, a.k.a. CERN, a massive circular atom and subatomic particle smasher built underground and managed by scientists. By reverse-engineering creation of matter, they discovered all matter has a common denominator called the Higgs Boson.
The international press quickly dubbed this brilliant discovery of the Higgs Boson force field the God particle, and it stuck! OMG. Does that mean our physical reality has a permanent unlimited, unboundaried common denominator? 
I was reluctant to take on this chore but was assured by my source that my effort at understanding our creation will grow all by Itself, first, very slowly, then as more and more people realize the fact of GOD, it will begin to seriously fester within society and will eventually affect behavior in all cultures of human consciousness and eventually cause a total revolution of world thought about concepts of God and religion. Plus, we will all have a renewed chance at a serious evaluation of our currently held philosophical concepts and ancient religious beliefs." />
