But recognized for his potential as an Animist, he is bought by his college and begins rigorous training. Now, Alex must begin his quest for his Anim-the animal with whom he will bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex hopes it will be an extraordinary creature that will help him earn the money he needs to buy his freedom.
