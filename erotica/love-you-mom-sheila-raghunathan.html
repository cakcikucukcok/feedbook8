  <title>Love You, Mom - Sheila Raghunathan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
He is totally in love with the women in his home. He wants her, he yearns her. The only thing standing between him and her is her. She is totally in love with him. But she&amp;#39;s scared of loving him, of losing him. Both lonely people living together come together and fall in love but unable to express their loves. He teaches her to live fully and love unconditionally. She wants him, he wants her. But, he is put to a test by her, to prove his love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Her skin glowed under the shining sun while sunbathing near the pool. Her hands held a cookbook. Her legs were creamy and slithery. For a mother to look this young was a fantasy. She was thirty but looked twenty. Her smooth navel, and her toes, spread themselves. The day was hot; the water in the pool was blazing. Her bust tightened in the bikini, she wore. The blue bikini squeezed her body. The panty squeezed her hips, and her tush. She closed the book and kept it away, removed her sunglasses and turned around. Showing that panty swelled amid the butt crack. She sprawls on her front, showing her back to the scorching sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I removed clothes, wore a swimming trunk, clutched the lotion and strode to the pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good morning son&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good morning mom,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So, what&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo; she asked,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nothing&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why are you staring at me like that?&amp;rdquo; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, nothing, mom,&amp;rdquo; I said and grabbed her book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at this bikini, this is an older one, didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to buy a new one&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I trudge to the pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re gonna jump,&amp;rdquo; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You wanna go in?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I jumped inside the pool, doused in water. It was relaxing. The blistering heat and blazing water on your body. I looked backward and saw her meander. She adjusted her bikini quivering and bouncing her bosom. She dipped both her legs in the pool and entered the pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Its too hot today isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;rdquo; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes mom,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was in one corner of the pool and I swam to her. What I saw was true artistry. Her soaked hair slipping to her soggy cleavage and the firm nipple concealed by the bikini. I went close to her. We settled facing each other." />
