      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Innovation holds the key to ongoing improvements in living standards, as well as to solving pressing social challenges. Skilled people play a crucial role in innovation through the new knowledge they generate, how they adopt and develop existing ideas, and through their ability to learn new competencies and adapt to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book seeks to increase understanding of the links between skills and innovation. It explores the wide range of skills required, ranging from technical to &quot;soft&quot;, and the ability to learn; it presents data and evidence on countries&#39; stocks and flows of skills and the links between skill inputs and innovation outputs. Given the importance of meeting the demands of knowledge-based economic activity, the book investigates the issues of skill supply, education, workplace training and work organisation. It highlights the importance of enabling individuals to acquire appropriate skills and of optimising these at work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
