  <title>My Virgin Daddy - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlie Griffin had sworn to save himself for marriage. When he met hot, sexy Elena Rodriguez, he thought his prayers had been answered. But then Elena is cruelly taken away from him on their wedding night. Succumbing to despair, Charlie sinks into depression. But he hasn&#39;t counted on the willpower of one young woman. Jasmine, Elena&#39;s daughter, won&#39;t let him throw his life away. She will do anything to claim the love of &quot;My Virgin Daddy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie was shivering with pleasure and fear. This was not what he had imagined his first time would be like. Rather than the culmination of weeks of planning after a wedding, he was being seduced by his dead wife&#39;s daughter. His eyes feasted on her incredible body, seeing for the first time what he had known unwillingly. Long, slim legs melded into a pair of subtly curved hips, the white lace of her high-cut panties emphasizing her slender waist. Above, her stomach was flat, the dimple of her navel winking at him saucily. The delicate fan of her ribs morphed irresistibly into the lovely curves of her breasts, standing out high and proud from the wall of her chest, obviously not needing the negligible support of her filmy bra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thirty-six C,&amp;rdquo; she said, catching his look. &amp;ldquo;A little smaller than Mama&#39;s, but then,&amp;rdquo; she shrugged, &amp;ldquo;I haven&#39;t had any babies yet. They&#39;ll probably get a bit bigger when I do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wasn&#39;t&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&#39;s all right, Charlie,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Men like to know.&amp;rdquo; She stepped closer, until he could feel the heat of her body. &amp;ldquo;Would you like to go to my room?&amp;rdquo; she asked quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not mine?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She shook her head. &amp;ldquo;Too many memories. I know Mama never slept with you there, but&amp;hellip;it would still feel like I was trying to take her place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&#39;m not, you know.&amp;rdquo; Her face, looking up into his, was solemn. &amp;ldquo;I know I&#39;m not her. I&#39;m me. But I&#39;m a me who loves you, Charlie. And I don&#39;t want you to hurt anymore.&amp;rdquo; She shook her head. &amp;ldquo;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m screwing this up. I just&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatly daring, Charlie laid his fingers across her full, kissable lips. His heart was hammering in his chest. Slowly, carefully, he enfolded his stepdaughter in his arms, until their bodies were pressed together. He could feel her soft curves against his bare chest. His arousal was an iron bar inside his slacks, pressing against her bare belly. Jasmine didn&#39;t flinch away. Instead, she made a low, growling noise deep in her throat, and her hands reached around him to grab his ass, pulling them even closer together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her eyes, when they met his, were shining. &amp;ldquo;Are you ready?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think so.&amp;rdquo;" />
