  <title>Lofty Towers - John Cleese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;And now for something completely different. &lt;I&gt;Professor at Large&lt;/I&gt; features beloved English comedian and actor John Cleese in the role of ivy league professor at Cornell University. His almost twenty years as professor-at-large has led to many talks, essays, and lectures on campus. This collection of the very best moments from Cleese under his mortarboard provides a unique view of his endless pursuit of intellectual discovery across a range of topics. Since 1999, Cleese has provided Cornell students and local citizens with his ideas on everything from scriptwriting to psychology, religion to hotel management, and wine to medicine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;His incredibly popular events and classes—including talks, workshops, and an analysis of&lt;I&gt; A Fish Called Wanda&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Life of Brian&lt;/I&gt;—draw hundreds of people. He has given a sermon at Sage Chapel, narrated Prokofiev’s&lt;I&gt; Peter and the Wolf&lt;/I&gt; with the Cornell Chamber Orchestra, conducted a class on script writing, and lectured on psychology and human development. Each time Cleese has visited the campus in Ithaca, NY, he held a public presentation, attended and or lectured in classes, and met privately with researchers. From the archives of these visits, &lt;I&gt;Professor at Large&lt;/I&gt; includes an interview with screenwriter William Goldman, a lecture about creativity entitled, &quot;Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind,&quot; talks about &lt;I&gt;Professor at Large&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Life of Brian&lt;/I&gt;, a discussion of facial recognition, and Cleese’s musings on group dynamics with business students and faculty.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Professor at Large&lt;/I&gt; provides a window into the workings of John Cleese’s scholarly mind, showcasing the wit and intelligence that have driven his career as a comedian, while demonstrating his knack of pinpointing the essence of humans and human problems. His genius on the screen has long been lauded; now his academic chops get their moment in the spotlight, too.&lt;/P&gt;" />
