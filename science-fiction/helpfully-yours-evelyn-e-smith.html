So she knew that, since the natives were non-alate, she was not to take wing on Earth. She had, however, forgotten to correlate the knowledge of their winglessness with her own vertical habits.

But it was only the wind of the car&amp;#39;s passage that had thrown her down. As she struggled to get up, hampered by her awkward native skirts, the door of the taxi flew open.
