  <title>Rise of the Human Androids - Malcolm P. Chester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this sequel to the Rise of the Human Androids, lizard like aliens called the Sharptors have perfected high-energy shields for hyperspace travel and begun exploring the galaxy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, James decides to not run for re-election for President of Mars. He plans instead to search the galaxy for old ones technology in a heavy cruiser with a supergun named after his wife. His wife and two children will join him on this journey. Susan, Mars&#39; Secretary of State and former President of the U.S. will run for James&#39; spot and James&#39; adopted human android daughter Martha will run for vice-president. James&#39; actions are motivated by the re-emergence of Ergone as the Marshall of the powerful and independent Altararian military.  James knows Ergone wants to avenge his loss to Mars and Earth in their last war.  James fears the Altararians with their vastly superior forces will crush Mars if he can&#39;t find advanced technology to stop them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a chance meeting, James encounters the Sharptors while looking at a promising planet for exploration.  A fight breaks out. James wins the encounter but the Sharptor warship escapes.  Still, a plan begins to emerge in James&#39; mind of how to use the aggressive new aliens against the Altararians.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile James and his associates explore an old ones site on their promising new earth like world Sisney 1. They must battle a super aggressive mammal the Ratang and insect the Botos, which have stripped Sisney 1 of almost all of its land animal life as they explore the site.  They find new technology at the site, which they plan to use against the Altararians.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile a secret organization called the Committee, which has controlled many economic events on Earth, finds it difficult to control Mars and its allied planets.  As a result, to make themselves relevant in the changing world around them, they join with bigoted groups on Mars and Ganymede and in a secret deal with the Altararians to sabotage Mars efforts to arm itself against the expected Altararian invasion.   Many characters on Earth, Mars and Ganymede battle this super secret group in their efforts to prepare Mars for the Altararian invasion.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All these forces clash as Mars struggles to survive its confrontation with the Altararians and preserve its Utopian World of human androids and human immigrants." />
