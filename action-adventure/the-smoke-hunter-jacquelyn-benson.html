      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Indiana Jones meets Lara Croft in Benson&#39;s engrossing action thriller.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  THE DEBUT OF A CAPTIVATING VOICE AND RIVETING STORYTELLER!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Frustrated suffragette and would-be archaeologist Ellie Mallory stumbles across a map to a city that shouldn&#39;t exist, a jungle metropolis alive and flourishing centuries after the Mayan civilization mysteriously collapsed. Discovering it would make her career, but Ellie isn&#39;t the only one after the prize. A disgraced professor and his ruthless handler are hot on her heels, willing to go any extreme to acquire the map for themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  To race them through the uncharted jungle, Ellie needs a guide.  The only one with the expertise  is maverick surveyor Adam Bates.  But with his determination to nose his way into Ellie&#39;s many secrets, Bates is a dangerous partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As Ellie gets closer to her goal, she realizes it&#39;s not just her ambitions at stake. A powerful secret lies hidden in the heart of the city - and if it falls into the wrong hands, it could shake the very fate of the world." />
