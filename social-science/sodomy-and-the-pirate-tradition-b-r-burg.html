  <title>Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition - B. R. Burg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pirates are among the most heavily romanticized and fabled characters in history.  From Bluebeard to Captain Hook, they have been the subject of countless movies, books, children&#39;s tales, even a world-famous amusement park ride.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;B&gt;Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition&lt;/B&gt;, historian B. R. Burg investigates the social and sexual world of these sea rovers, a tightly bound brotherhood of men engaged in almost constant warfare. What, he asks, did these men, often on the high seas for years at a time, do for sexual fulfillment? Buccaneer sexuality differed widely from that of other all- male institutions such as prisons, for it existed not within a regimented structure of rule, regulations, and oppressive supervision, but instead operated in a society in which widespread toleration of homosexuality was the norm and conditions encouraged its practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his new introduction, Burg discusses the initial response to the book when it was published in 1983 and how our perspectives on all-male societies have since changed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
