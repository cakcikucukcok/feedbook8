  <title>This Is the Last Time! - Andrew J. Scales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear children of LORD GOD, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to be LORD GOD JESUS CHRISTS son. JESUS will seat me in his throne, like my GRANDFATHER sat my FATHER LORD GOD in his seat. I will get a stone with a new name and more. Im running in the race for the prize in the Holy Book. I am just trying, and when I do, I will not be trying any more. I am hoping to do well. Now we know that faith is the substance of things we hope for, and we do have evidence of the existence of things not seen. I am trying to be with JESUS, as he is my faith. I thank our GRANDFATHER GOD, as he is my belief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called on the LORD FATHER GOD and GRANDFATHER GOD and I received the Holy Book. The Holy Book is too shared with all of GODS children. JESUS will be my GOD and I will be his son. By reading this book you will edify unto yourself that GOD is true. This book is one of the promises of the LORD. Read this book and you will read what has happen and what is going to happen. My Testimony: our Father, the LORD, will show us better than we can read. This is the last time! This book is publish because it is about the gospel; The Revelation of JESUS CHRIST. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this book. May our FATHER LORD GOD be with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours, Andrew Scales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps. Hosea 4:6v. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy GOD, I will also forget thy children.&lt;br /&gt;
