  <title>The Clydesiders - Margaret Thomson Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the summer of 1914, as the storm clouds of war begin to gather over Europe, life in Glasgow goes on as normal - for the rich in their elegant mansions, and for the poor in the overcrowded tenements of the Gorbals. Up at Hilltop House, home of the wealthy Cartwright family, Virginia Watson is a kitchen maid whose life below stairs is an endless round of hardship and drudgery. Back in the Gorbals, her family are fighting a losing battle against unemployment, hunger and disease, while her father and brothers dream of the revolution that John Maclean and the &#39;Red Clydesiders&#39; promise will be their salvation. Everything changes for Virginia after a chance meeting with Nicholas Cartwright, a dashing young army officer and heir to the Cartwright fortune. Defying all the conventions of the time, their illicit romance has hardly begun when war breaks out, and Nicholas leaves to face the horrors of the Western Front. A powerful tale of love and loss, The Clydesiders is a brilliant portrayal of Glasgow during the First World War and the revolutionary turmoil of Red Clydeside." />
