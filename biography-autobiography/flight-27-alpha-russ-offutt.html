  <title>Flight 27 Alpha - Russ Offutt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Flight 27 Alpha is the compelling story of two men, father and son, tragically separated by an incident officially termed as an unexplained military accident.   Father and son were brought together again 50 years in the future.  Follow Captain Robert E. Hayes, the father from World War II in 1943 and General Robert E. Hayes Jr., the son from 1993 as they meet face to face once again, this time, in a  very unusual way and get to know one another in a bizarre twist of fate that cannot be explained.   With the help of a military historian, and their attempt to challenge what appears to be the impossible,  father and son, along with the military historian, devise and attempt to carry out a mission that, if successful, would utilize the technology of 1993 on an aircraft from 1943 and alter the course of World War II and thereby save millions of lives in the process.  In the end, follow four generations of Hayes men as they love and honor one another over a span of 68 years, Lieutenant Berry Hayes, World War I Curtiss H-16 bomber pilot, great grandfather,  Captain Robert E. Hayes, World War II B-17G Flying Fortress pilot, grandfather, General Robert E. Hayes, Jr., Vietnam Veteran F-4B pilot, father and Lieutenant Colonel Edward Berry Hayes, F-16 Fighting Falcon, great grandson, grandson and son." />
