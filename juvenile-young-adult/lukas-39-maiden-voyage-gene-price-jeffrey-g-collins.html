  <title>Lukas&#39; Maiden Voyage - Gene Price, Jeffrey G. Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lukas Maiden Voyage was written as a fable in which animals speak and act like people. The target audience ranges from nine years old to teenagers, even to moms and dads who may take delight in reading this story to their young children. The story revolves around the Passover celebration and Christs triumphal entry into Jerusalem, as seen through the eyes of the young burro that carried him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intended for all Christians who grew up hearing about the life of Christs ministry, this story centers around a small, crippled colt that has been bullied his entire life by two Arabian stallions, who find ways to taunt the burro and make his life miserable. The name of the colt is Lukas, and the antagonistic twin brothers are Nimb and Obus. The colts greatest wish is to have someone come to Jethros stables and choose him for a ride. Since the little donkey was born with a weak back and a crippled leg, no one ever has. The young burros life changes dramatically when Lukas unknowingly meets Christ and is chosen by the Messiah to be ridden on the most important journey the world will ever know. Since hes never been ridden, this becomes Lukass maiden voyage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
