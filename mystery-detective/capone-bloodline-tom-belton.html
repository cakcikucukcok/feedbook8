  <title>Capone Bloodline - Tom Belton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Al Scar Face Capone, head of the Chicago Crime Family, was born in Brooklyn in 1898 and moved to Chicago when he was eighteen years old in 1916.  Allegedly, Al Capone orchestrated the February 14th, 1929 St. Valentines Day Massacre. Some say it was the most notorious mass murder of the 20th Century.
Al Capone head of the Boston Capone Family was born in Avellino Italy in 1895 and came to America through Ellis Island, New York in 1913 when he was eighteen years old. The family settled in the North End of Boston.  Albert Frank Capone of Boston was allegedly first cousin to Al and Frank Capone of Chicago.
Capone, was grateful to have brought his .45mm automatic pistol to the Sherwood Boston Hotel that day in June 1973.  His father had always told him to make sure he landed the first punch in a fight. Actually, he said, Make sure you cold cock the bastard with the first punch and then run like hell before he knows what hit him. Upon entering the hotel garage, Capones reaction came instinctively. A potential armed robber, brandishing a firearm, stepped out from behind a pillar, and demanded his money. There was no time to weigh the pros and cons of taking him out. The man had already produced his weapon, making Capones decision for him.  What might have happened, however, suddenly took a twist.  Capone pulled out his weapon a moment too late, giving the robber a momentary edge.  Maybe it was complacency, or maybe it was stupidity, but the would-be-robber had neglected to disengage the safety on his weapon. In that instant Capone closed the distance between them. Who knew how many times he had robbed before? Tonight he had selected the wrong target. The taste of bile formed a lump in Capones throat as he contemplated what might have been" />
