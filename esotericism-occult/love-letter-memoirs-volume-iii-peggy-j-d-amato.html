  <title>Love Letter Memoirs Volume Iii - Peggy J. D’Amato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love Letter Memoirs, Volume III, The Art of Love, in fifty shades of white, is about the love between a young girl and an artist. A romance with love letters spanning fifty years. Letters with artwork on the envelopes, painted by this Dutch/American master artist, Hans Krommenhoek. Hans found his artistic motivation in loving Peggy, thus called, The Art of Love, his work was an expression of his unending love for Peggy, his artistic strength in versatility. Hans virtually worked in any medium, as well as having the extraordinaire ability to reproduce other masters work, such as seen in the copy reproduction Hans did of the English artist, Edward Ladells masterwork, called Still Life with Birds Nest. 
This is a beautiful love story with colored copies of original artwork Hans did for Peggy on his love letters to her. The dates and stamps give you the years the art was done. Written for all age groups to enjoy, viewable as an e-book as well as text. Great as a table top display to view the art. You will want to read again and again to study the artwork, as he, at times, wrote messages in his work, placed people hidden, as well as painted the clouds to appear as horses, birds, warriors, or messages." />
