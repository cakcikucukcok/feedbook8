  <title>Terns of Endearment - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new side-splitting Meg Langslow mystery from the award-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Toucan Keep a Secret.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meg Langslow&#39;s grandfather has been booked by a cruise line to give lectures on birds and other environmental topics as part of their ship&#39;s education/entertainment itinerary, and Grandfather has arranged for a passel of family members to join him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The passengers&#39; vacation quickly becomes a nightmare when they wake up to find themselves broken down and in need of repairs in the Bermuda Triangle. To keep the stranded passengers calm, Meg&#39;s family and friends band together to keep things organized and provide entertainment. Some even take up the cause of nursing an injured tern back to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things get even worse when a crew member announces to all that a woman has jumped overboard, leaving behind her shoes, shawl, and a note. The note reveals she&#39;s the mortal enemy of group of writers who came on board for a retreat, and the group is split on whether suicide is in-character for her. Meanwhile, grandfather&#39;s assistant Trevor seems to have gone missing too! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The captain decides not to investigate, saying he&#39;ll notify American authorities when they reach their destination. But Meg&#39;s father thinks they should find out whether there was foul play while the prime suspects are all stuck on board. Who wanted the writer dead? Why doesn&#39;t the captain seem concerned? What happened to Trevor? It&#39;ll be a race against the clock to solve these mysteries before they make the necessary repairs and return to shore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Terns of Endearment &lt;/i&gt;is the twenty-fifth book in &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Donna Andrews&#39; hilarious Mag Langslow mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
