        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes, one small mistake can have life-altering consequences…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a veteran social worker, Ellen Moore has seen it all - the vilest acts one person can commit against another. The only thing that gets her through the workday is knowing her job helps children. That, and her family: her husband, Adam, and three beautiful kids, twins Leah and Lucas, and eleven-month-old Avery. But with a blink of an eye - with one small mistake - Ellen is suddenly at the mercy of the system she works for. Avery is ripped from her clutches, and her whole world begins crashing down around her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ten-year-old Jenny Briard has been living with her well-meaning but good-for-nothing father since her mother left them. When her father decides to pack their belongings and move to a new state, Jenny thinks she might be on the road to a better life. But soon she finds herself on her own, forced to survive with nothing but a few dollars and her street smarts. Evading police and the social system, Jenny finds refuge with a kind-hearted waitress. The last thing she needs is a social worker, but when Ellen and Jenny&#39;s lives collide unexpectedly, little do they know just how much they can help one another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Heather Gudenkauf:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘This will have you gripped until the last page’ – Closer&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Deeply moving and lyrical’ – Company&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘A memorable read’ – Sunday Express&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘totally gripping’ – Marie Claire&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Set to become a bookclub staple’ – &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;&lt;strong&gt;Fans of Jodi Picoult will devour this&lt;/strong&gt;&#39; - Red&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Gudenkauf’s prose is searingly raw… Thrilling and emotionally tender, this novel, with its driving pace, &lt;strong&gt;will appeal to fans of…Jodi Picoult&lt;/strong&gt;.&#39; - Booklist&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘This gripping novel is moving and thought-provoking’ -&lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
