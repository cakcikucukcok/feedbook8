  <title>Geo-Justice - Jim Conlon, McDonagh Sean, Thomas Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Book Whose Time Has Finally Come&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has changed a lot since 1990. George H.W. Bush was in the White House, John Paul II was in the 12th year of his 27-year papacy, and the World Wide Web had yet to be launched. That year, an independent publisher out of Canada called Woodlake Books, Inc. published a title called &lt;em&gt;Geo-Justice: A Preferential Option for the Earth&lt;/em&gt; by Jim Conlon. The book melded profound insights from mystical theology with lively and passionate calls to action from prominent community organizers and environmentalists. In that book and others, Conlon&amp;rsquo;s faith-based exhortations to care for our planet combined with those of Theilhard de Chardin, Thomas Berry, and a small cadre of environmental prophets to help pave the way 25 years later for the landmark encyclical of the current pope, &lt;em&gt;Laudato Si&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to Pope Francis, this new edition of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Geo-Justice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;boasts not only a foreword by Thomas Berry and a new foreword by fellow priest and earth-rights activist, Sean McDonagh, but also a fully revised text. The new edition contains fresh poetry from Conlon, reflections on &lt;em&gt;Laudato Si&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, and updated practices that incorporate another 25 years&amp;rsquo; worth of experience in preparing lay people for community work and ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the world has changed vastly in a quarter century, the need for an updated vision of Christianity that incorporates the truths of science with the soul of our faith has not.&lt;/p&gt;" />
