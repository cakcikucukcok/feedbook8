  <title>Spirit Speaks - Shirley Battie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for readers looking for answers about life in clear easy to understand language explaining why we are the way we are and where we are going.  It is for anyone who is just opening up to spirit and for those who have a lot of spiritual and psychic experience, and for everyone in between.  It ranges from basic understanding of how communication takes place and by whom. Who can we trust in receiving information?  Look within the pages for answers to that.  Difficult controversial questions are also answered about subjects such as suicide, abortions, guilt and euthanasia; subjects that not many want to openly discuss. This is your opportunity to explore and decide for yourself how you feel. 
Communication with planetary beings from other spheres and dimensions have their input into these pages.  Predictions as to our future existence are included. Questions are put and answered as to our future on this planet, which we would do well to consider. 
The angelic realm, spirit guides and celestial beings are introduced through questioning individuals who seek answers. Thought on the animal kingdom is not neglected.
Some of you will say I already know all that. This just confirms how much you have grown and advanced.  If that applies to you then skip ahead to other subjects. I dont pretend to know all the answers and quite possibly have some wrong.  They are meant to encourage debate and discussion. Apathy does not encourage change we may wish for. I know you are not apathetic or you would not be reading this book.
	What I currently explain and put forth in this book is always subject to change as understanding and knowledge expands. What I believe today may not be how I see things and believe in the future. Also what one doesnt understand today may be understood later on. I have answered the questions exactly as they have been put to me as honestly and as" />
