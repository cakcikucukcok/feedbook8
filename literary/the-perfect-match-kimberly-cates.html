          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;At twenty-seven, free-spirited Rowena Brown has never fitted in anywhere – not with her ambitious family, not at veterinary school and certainly not in any relationship she’s ever had.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But surely the good people of Whitewater, Illinois, will welcome a pet-store owner whose talent is finding the perfect home for “problem” animals, even if they do have names like Destroyer. When a hundred-pound monstrosity of a dog appears at his door, Whitewater deputy Cash Lawless knows he’s in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A single dad with two young daughters, Cash wants more chaos in his life about as much as he wants to find himself drawn to the eccentric Rowena. But if he’s not careful, the unruly hound and his unconventional owner might re-ignite Cash’s hopes along with his heart – and help them all find home at last&lt;/p&gt;
