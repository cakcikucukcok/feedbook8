  <title>The White Light: A Limitless Reality - Helena Steiner-Hornsteyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do medical miracles happen? Is there such a thing as Divine Intervention? Do angels exist? Is there an afterlife and could it affect our lives here and now? What is the White Light and how can I find it? Can it help me? The answers to these questions can be found in &lt;em&gt;The White Light &amp;mdash; A Limitless Reality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helena Steiner-Hornsteyn&lt;/strong&gt; has come to the realization, through her own experiences and encounters with the supernatural, that there is an extended reality that we have not yet dared accept in this world that is so full of control and limitation. She has lived through miracles, met angels and had other extraordinary spiritual encounters and feels that her experiences, as well as the experiences of others happening all over the world today, are proof enough that there is an existing reality that we have been made to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She was born with a gift of healing but early on refused to accept her gift and instead had to start her spiritual path from the very beginning &amp;mdash; learning step by step what was possible and what was not. After more and more spiritual encounters, her awareness expanded and she soon became part of a world that has so many more possibilities than what we have been made to believe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The White Light &amp;mdash; A Limitless Reality &lt;/em&gt;is full of extraordinary true stories of exciting spiritual insights and new revelations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev. Dr. Helena Steiner-Hornsteyn&lt;/strong&gt; is an inspirational teacher, lecturer and a leading authority in the field of personal transformation and healing of body and mind. She was born in Sweden and lives in the United States. She works internationally.&lt;/p&gt;" />
