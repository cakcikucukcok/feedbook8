  <title>Everyone Has an It - Vicki Baird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Working with amazing people for the past thirteen years led me to recognize what seemed to be consistent themes in peoples lives. With each consultation it became clearer that each person wasnt aware of his or her own special wiring. All of them were more tied into what wasnt working rather than what was and more willing to acknowledge their seemingly shortcomings rather than their skills. While I could acknowledge what was amazing in them, they werent quite there yet. What grew from this experience was knowledge that I could offer a to-go package that would help while on their journey, perhaps holding the energy of their greatness until they were ready to see it. This is that to-go packagea combination of humor, practical advice, and respect for energy that can guide anyone to self-acceptance, empowerment, and the manifestation of the absolute joy life can offer. Learn how to combine all of these elements and live the life you want and know you are meant to have.&lt;/p&gt;" />
