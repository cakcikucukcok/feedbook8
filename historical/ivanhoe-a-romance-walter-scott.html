  <title>Ivanhoe - A Romance - Walter Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This vintage book contains Sir Walter Scott&#39;s 1820 historical novel, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. Set in twelfth-century England, it tells the story of a Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a Saxon who has become disgraced in his father&#39;s eyes for his allegiance to the Norman king, Richard I. Ivanhoe is considered to have had a significant influence on increasing interest in romance and medievalism in literature, and it is highly recommended for those with an interest in these genres. Sir Walter Scott (1771 - 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, poet, and playwright - considered to be the first truly international English-language author. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author." />
