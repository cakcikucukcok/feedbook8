  <title>The Wright Stuff - Victor J. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young and healthy, Victor J. Wright was only fifteen years old in 1976 when he broke his neck playing football at John Muir High School in Pasadena, California. He had severed the vertebrae at the second level, right under his brain. Many suffering this injury would have died, but Wright survived.
In The Wright Stuff, author David D. Rutherford, Wrights former classmate, friend, and former newspaper reporter, tells Wrights storyfrom his birth, through his injury and hospitalization, and beyond. This biography narrates how Wright was one of the first quadriplegics to earn a college degree and how he cofounded a nonprofit organization that provides relief efforts to victims of natural disasters around the world. It shares how Wright donates books and audiovisual materials to local libraries and has inspired numerous squads from his high school alma mater to victory. In 2013, he was ordained a minister by the Association of Fundamental Ministers and Churches.
Though Wright has experienced a host of challenges throughout the years, he credits his faith in God and the loving care of his family and closest friends for being allowed to live the past four decades in a way that has inspired thousands and has made him a community treasure." />
