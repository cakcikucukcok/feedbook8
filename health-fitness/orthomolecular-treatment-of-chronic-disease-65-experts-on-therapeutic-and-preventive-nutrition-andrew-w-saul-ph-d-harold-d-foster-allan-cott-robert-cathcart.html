  <title>Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease: 65 Experts on Therapeutic and Preventive Nutrition - Andrew W. Saul, Ph.D., Harold D Foster, Allan Cott, Robert Cathcart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If the word &quot;cure&quot; intrigues you, this book will also. High doses of vitamins have been known to cure serious illnesses for nearly 80 years.    Claus Jungeblut, M.D., prevented and treated polio in the mid-1930s, using a vitamin. Chest specialist Frederick Klenner, M.D., was curing multiple sclerosis and polio back in the 1940s, also using vitamins. William Kaufman, M.D., cured arthritis, also in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Drs. Wilfrid and Evan Shute were curing various forms of cardiovascular disease with a vitamin. At the same time, psychiatrist Abram Hoffer was using niacin to cure schizophrenia, psychosis, and depression. In the 1960s, Robert Cathcart, M.D., cured influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis. In the 1970s, Hugh D. Riordan, M.D., was obtaining cures of cancer with intravenous vitamin C. Dr. Harold Foster and colleagues arrested and reversed full-blown AIDS with nutrient therapy, and in just the last few years, Atsuo Yanagasawa, M.D., Ph.D., has shown that vitamin therapy can prevent and reverse sickness caused by exposure to nuclear radiation. Since 1968, much of this research has been published in the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine. This book brings forward important material selected from over forty-five years of JOM directly to the reader.        At some 800 pages, The Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease is a very large book, but it is also a very practical book. If you want to know which illnesses best respond to nutrition therapy, and how and why that therapy works, this is the book for you. Part One presents the principles of orthomolecular medicine and the science behind them. Part Two is devoted to orthomolecular pioneers, presenting an introduction to maverick doctors and nutrition scientists in a reader-friendly way that brings the subject to life. Part Three brings together extraordinary clinical and experimental evidence from expert researchers and clinicians.        The Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease shows exactly how innovative physicians have gotten outstanding results with high-dose nutrient therapy. Their work is here for you to see and decide for yourself.        The Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease, subtitled &quot;65 Experts on Therapeutic and Preventive Nutrition,&quot; is a complete course in nutritional healing for less than thirty dollars." />
