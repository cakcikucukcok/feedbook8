He describes how he confronted his hang-ups, got a word processor, taught himself to use it and gradually overcame his sense of inferiority to the machine. He explains how the word processor&amp;#8212;by enabling him to revise his work instantly on a screen&amp;#8212;has changed his lifelong methods of writing, rewriting and editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But William Zinsser&#39;s book isn&#39;t only for writers. It&#39;s for all the people who have to do any kind of writing&amp;#8212;memos, letters, reports, directives&amp;#8212;as part of their working day. It explains how the word processor will save time and money in an office or a corporation and predicts that it will soon be our primary writing tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one level &lt;em&gt;Writing with a Word Processor&lt;/em&gt; is a manual for beginners that describes clearly and simply how to use the new technology. But it is also one writer&#39;s story. William Zinsser takes the reader along on a highly personal journey, writing with warmth and humor about his anxieties and fears, his setbacks and triumphs. His book is both an informal guide and an encouraging companion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
