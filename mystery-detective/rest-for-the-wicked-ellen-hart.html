  <title>Rest for the Wicked - Ellen Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ellen Hart was named the 2017 MWA Grand Master, the most distinguished lifetime achievement award offered in the mystery community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeAndre Moore came to Minneapolis from St. Louis with a purpose, but things aren&#39;t going as he planned. When it becomes clear he&#39;s in way over his head, DeAndre can think of only one person to call for help--his Uncle Nolan&#39;s business partner, newly licensed private investigator Jane Lawless. However, by the time Jane listens to his voice mail, she&#39;s hearing a voice from beyond the grave--DeAndre left the message only minutes before he was knifed to death outside a gentlemen&#39;s club. Soon his murder isn&#39;t the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nolan in the hospital, Jane sets out to find out who killed DeAndre, how his death is connected with the others, and what he was doing in Minneapolis in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rest for the Wicked&lt;/i&gt; is another outstanding addition to Ellen Hart&#39;s award-winning mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
