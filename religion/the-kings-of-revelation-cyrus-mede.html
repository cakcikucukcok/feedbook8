  <title>The Kings of Revelation - Cyrus Mede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I could write much more on this subject of our spiritual walk but I have only built upon another mans foundation, pertaining to these matters. Watchman Nee at the tum of the last century whilst in a Chinese prison and as a martyer wrote several works which have been complied into one volume the Spiritual Man. I would suggest this as a compulsory read, as the truths contained are pure spiritual gold and will certainly set you on the correct spiritual path.
As you are now aware much has been added to the book of Revelation and many a predecessor has added to the book, which has led them away from the truth contained therein with theories of great tribulations and raptures of the Church. I have in no way attempted to answer all the mysteries contained in this book but only to lay a true foundation on which others may build.
Just as the early apostles used the Old Testament to write the New so I have done only the same as they have by using both, so that I may not labor in vain. The book of the Acts of the Apostles has never stopped being written and will go on until the end of the age. As the Apostle Paul admonishes the church in Galatia.
Galatians 1: 9 As we said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from or contrary to that which you received ffrom us], let him be accursed [anathema, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment]!
This I also claim with my apostolic authority. This is my Gospel of the end, the Gospel of Kings. It is a word that I received from Jesus himself, and I claim all of the apostolic rights to be a special messenger sent from God, and to reprove and correct the Church of the Living God, as He has authorized me to do. Do not add to nor take away from any of the words contained herein. Selah, pause and calmly think of and reflect on these things. Amen so, be, it." />
