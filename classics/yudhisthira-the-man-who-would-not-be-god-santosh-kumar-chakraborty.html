  <title>Yudhisthira... the Man Who Would Not Be God - Santosh Kumar Chakraborty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Mahabharatam&#39;, a classic in Sanskrit is one of the most long-lived saga of human history. Its story line is beyond any adjectives, effects dramatic and its impact on our intellect and values is timeless.
The present book is the literary and philosophical appraisal of one of the brightest characters of the epic, &#39;Yudhisthira&#39;. The interpretations follows the footsteps of Yudhisthira and tries to unravel the most intricate weavings of human mind and society to find the brightest crisscross of desires, values and limitations and above all, the highest religion of humans---------the humanity at large.
The name of the book reverberates the glory of being a human. Yudhisthira, like any earthly Man, faces the ups and downs of life. He gets cuts and bruises, he suffers, he laments, but every defeat, every downfall makes him stronger, wiser, more compassionate and Grand. The grandeur of the epic, of the character, is this painful journey towards the never attainable perfection of humanity, the eternal story of being and becoming.
Yudhisthira is a man, he cannot be God and the author says that he need not become a God to be more revered and respected. &#39;Godliness&#39; may depict the ultimate qualities and power, but, humanity can never be belittled in its comparison. In fact, humanity, with all its shortcomings, is more dear to us, more close to our heart and thus, it is eternal.                
The present author is no more amongst us, he has left the mundane body to the clutches of lung cancer on 7th of April, 2013. But the book written by him in the last eight fighting months of his life is reverberating the same spirit of human nature, where the mind, the intellect, the thought takes rebirth again and again, like a &#39;phoenix&#39;, from the fire of death. The book thus is a song of immortality, immortality present among each of us, immortality rediscovered by every sensitive human mind...." />
