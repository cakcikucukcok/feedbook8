  <title>Christianity and Politics: The Attempted Seduction of the Bride of Christ - Christopher R. Petruzzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the Bride of Christ, the body of Christian believers has been called to serve Him. One aspect of this calling is that we are God&#39;s instrument to change the world. This book addresses the question of how Christians should go about facilitating that calling.  Politics is the process through which some people attempt to prevail over others for the control of government. Is that what Christ wants for his holy people, or is the lure of politics an attempt to bring us into Satan&#39;s world?  Christianity and Politics presents a logically developed analysis of this question using the Bible, history, and modern theories of economics and political science. Christians from all political and theological backgrounds are likely to find that this book changes their thinking about the church and political involvement." />
