  <title>Dark Road to Darjeeling (A Lady Julia Grey Novel, Book 4) - Deanna Raybourn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After eight idyllic months in the Mediterranean, Lady Julia Grey and her detective husband are ready to put their investigative talents to work once more. At the urging of Julia&#39;s eccentric family, they hurry to India to aid an old friend, the newly widowed Jane Cavendish.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Living on the Cavendish tea plantation with the remnants of her husband&#39;s family, Jane is consumed with the impending birth of her child–and with discovering the truth about her husband&#39;s death. Was he murdered for his estate? And if he was, could Jane and her unborn child be next?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amid the lush foothills of the Himalayas, dark deeds are buried and malicious thoughts flourish. The Brisbanes uncover secrets and scandal, illicit affairs and twisted legacies. In this remote and exotic place, exploration is perilous and discovery, deadly. The danger is palpable and, if they are not careful, Julia and Nicholas will not live to celebrate their first anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
