      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;True Mind&lt;/i&gt;, Tom Steward makes a daring attempt at describing, practically and specifically, how we may grow and change in Christ by the Spirit. Written for todays disciple, this book seeks to illuminate and inspire as well as instruct those who seek to be renewed and enlarged in their inner lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the three parts of this book, Steward addresses the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our Inner Legacy &lt;br&gt;
 Beginning with a proper foundation, knowing God for who He is, glory and majesty, and encountering Him in intimacy &lt;br&gt;
 Knowing who we are and what we have been given, that we may carry out our destiny in the Lord &lt;br&gt;
 Learning to listen and hearknow and seeour God and all He has to offer us 
 Walking in Gods energy and power and the unlimited bounds of His provision &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our Inner Work &lt;br&gt;
 Understanding the role of the Spirit as he searches and reveals to us all we need to know about God and ourselves &lt;br&gt;
 Offering submission and surrender as a daily spiritual practice &lt;br&gt;
 Ensuring that we respond well to all the issues of lifethe arrows that strike us all too oftenas God supplies His goodness and mercy &lt;br&gt;
 Contending with the inner nature of sin as it is represented by fear and pride and offering humility and courage as a timely replacement &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our Inner Life &lt;br&gt;
 Experiencing the mystery of oneness with God and being found in Him as He is in us &lt;br&gt;
 Knowing transformation and renewal so that God can drape his righteousness and holiness over us like a garment &lt;br&gt;
 Learning to be still and at rest, as we abide and flow in and with our God, and learning the benefits of thanks and praise in all of our days&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;" />
