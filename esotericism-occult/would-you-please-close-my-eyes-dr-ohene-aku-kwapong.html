  <title>Would You Please Close My Eyes? - Dr. Ohene Aku Kwapong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a man has done what he considers his duty to his people and country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is why I will sleep for eternity. Nelson Mandela&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words of a man whose story is worthy of his seat in life. There is a secret in these words that is etched deep in our fabric, but remains to be awakened in a gift exclusive to us. Your gift will never be until the stories of your life are stories of people. The risk to the gift is an obsession with the inanimate luxuries and ideas exclusive of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it because my angel chanced upon me when I was dying. He was here because I am here. He was different, but differences have nothing to do with ones seat but rather providences purpose for us. Like him, I had no choice in my lifes package. We had a lifetimes opportunity to share time and space. What we do with such opportunities ultimately reveals our gift and a contentment that closes ones eyes for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story one little boy, who shares your fate, discovered. He is here because you are here.&lt;/p&gt;" />
