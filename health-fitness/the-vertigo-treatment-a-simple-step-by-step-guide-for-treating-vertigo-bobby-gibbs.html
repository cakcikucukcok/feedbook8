In most cases vertigo is associated with conditions that relate to the vestibular system (inner ear). If problems arise in this area, they can result with issues such as vertigo, dizziness, a lack of balance and poor coordination.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In addition, the eyes (visual system) and body (proprioceptive system) also play a major role in preventing vertigo, maintaining balance and keeping the body in harmony. The visual system, vestibular system and proprioceptive system must all be working in a coordinated and seamless fashion, to avoid sensory issues such as dizziness, pain and nausea.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Here Bobby Gibbs demystifies over 20,000 hours of experience into a simple step by step guide, for those suffering from vertigo, dizziness or vestibular disorders. He explains the root cause of most disorders related to vertigo and provides methods on how to overcome vertigo.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As a personal and vestibular trainer, having suffered from vertigo for several years, Bobby Gibbs has dedicated his time to helping vertigo sufferers cope and recover from their symptoms.
