  <title>God&#39;s Girl - Josephine Caban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="this book is a collection of my genuine feelings
about God and his many graces. This book has been
written over the course of several years. It entails my
feelings about love and people who were and who are in
my life. I have always had a close relationship with God
ever since I was a teenager I have been very close to him.
I have been through many things and I have learned that
what really matters is Gods love for us all and even at
the roughest times of our lives he is there holding us up
and lifting us up so we dont fall but, succeded in doing
what we are called to do.
God has played a major role in my life and has kept me
grounded and has sustained me through the roughest
time. So even when you think God isnt with you
anymore just remember, God is always there no matter
how much you sin he loves you and I hope you love
this book." />
