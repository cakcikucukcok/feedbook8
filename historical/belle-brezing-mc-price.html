  <title>Belle Brezing - Mc Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Somewhere between a paperboys first cup of chicory coffee and the memories of the Madam who inspired Belle Watling of Gone With the Wind fame, there lies a story of sex, secrets and spiritual redemption. Interweaving portals to the past with the magic of a Spirit Guide called back to his lovers deathbed, Belle Brezing is a haunting love story about a loyal paperboy on a high-stakes mission: To guide his former lover to remember the secret that forged her rise to fame but closed her heart to love.
Belle Brezing, the novel, takes a look at the woman who died in virtual isolation in 1940, decades after her business was closed by the Army in 1917. Brezing was a nationally known southern Madam whose obituary appeared on the front of the NY Times as well as Time Magazine. (1863-1940)
Belle Brezing was a charismatic woman who brought herself out of poverty and an emotionally and physically painful early childhood. Shedding light on the connections of a wounded past and a life lived in quiet desperation, the award-winning novel Belle Brezing exposes the scandals and secrets of this dynamic woman whose life parallels timely issues in the arena of prostitution and sex trafficking." />
