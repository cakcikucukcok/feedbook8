  <title>Chasing Hunger - Kathy Welter Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;How can Chasing Hunger, the 90 day Bulimia Breakthrough Method&lt;/em&gt;  help me with my recovery?  Whether you are in recovery and taking care of yourself at home now, or attempting to help yourself make a decision about seeking help,  this book offers specific step-by-step strategies to help you  target areas that can trigger binge eating. In &lt;em&gt;Chasing Hunger,&lt;/em&gt; understanding the source that can trigger such behaviour  like having certain emotions trigger a binge ( feeling depressed, sad, bored, or tired), or it could be a deficiency in certain nutrients, or it could be just a pattern that becomes an addictive habit, that you&#39;ve conditioned yourself into from the past.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many people with  disordered eating patterns have indeed figured out how to conquer this behaviour themselves, and clients have shared this with me.  The fact  is we all know that when it comes to making a significant change in a long standing behaviour pattern, or addictive habit, we really do have to want to secure the change for it to work  and in fact, when others press us for changes to behaviour, we often resist because we don&#39;t see the problem.    I&#39;ve worked with clients with bulimia and disordered eating patterns over the past 15 years. In my book, &lt;em&gt;Chasing Hunger,&lt;/em&gt; I share with you all the tips and tools you can use to help yourself.  You can also use this book to help yourself stabilize your eating patterns once you are into a solid recovery program.  Others who have read this book have used the strategies to help themselves balance carbs and proteins, helped themselves with regulating blood sugar, as the whole program is based on the glycemic index eating plan. It&#39;s one of the healthiest ways we can eat. So you will be learning how to help yourself and maintaining good healthy strategies around food, going forward. After all, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Food is just fuel&quot;. &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
