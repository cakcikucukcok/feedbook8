He taught her about cars, baseball, and everything else worth knowing. But Grandpa&amp;#8217;s memory has been getting bad&amp;#8212;so bad that he sometimes can&amp;#8217;t even remember Robbie&amp;#8217;s name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#8217;s sure that she&amp;#8217;s making things worse by getting in trouble at school, but she can&amp;#8217;t resist using her fists when bullies like Alex Carter make fun of her for not having a mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she&amp;#8217;s stuck in group guidance&amp;#8212;and to make things even worse, Alex Carter is there too. There&amp;#8217;s no way Robbie&amp;#8217;s going to open up about her life to some therapy group, especially not with Alex in the room. Besides, if she told anyone how forgetful&amp;#160;Grandpa&amp;#8217;s been getting lately, they&amp;#8217;d take her away from him.

Martin, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Rain Reign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A fresh coming-of-age novel as feisty, funny, and forthright as its protagonist. Robinson overcomes obstacles with wit, grit, and a growing compassion for others, showing us that families are what we make them and happiness is found in the simple gifts we take for granted. A rich, rewarding read all around.&quot;&amp;#8212;John David Anderson, author of &lt;em&gt;Ms. Bixby&#39;s Last Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As close to perfect as a book for middle grade children can get!&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Cammie McGovern, author of &lt;em&gt;Just My Luck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? &quot;Stoddard debuts with a quiet but powerful narrative that gently unpacks Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s, centers mental health, and moves through the intimate and intense emotional landscape of family&amp;#8212;what seems to break one and what can remake it. Validating, heart-rending, and a deft blend of suffering and inspiration.&quot;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A home-run story that will resonate with all who feel they might not fit into the perfect definition of a family.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Debut author Stoddard crafts a winning narrator in Robinson.
