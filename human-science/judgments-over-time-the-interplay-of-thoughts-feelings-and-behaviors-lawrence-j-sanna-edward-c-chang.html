  <title>Judgments over Time: The Interplay of Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors - Lawrence J. Sanna, Edward C. Chang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time pervades every aspect of peoples lives.  We are all affected by remnants of our pasts, assessments of our presents, and forecasts of our futures.  Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors over time inexorably intertwine and intermingle, determining varied reactions such as affect and emotions, as well as future behaviors.  The purpose of this volume is to bring together the diverse theory and research of an outstanding group of scholars whose work relates to peoples judgements over time.  To date, much theory and research on temporal variables within psychology has remained somewhat fragmented, isolated, and even provincial--researchers in particular domains are either unaware of or are paying little attention to each others work.  Integrating the theory and research into a single volume will bring about a greater awareness and appreciation of conceptual relations between seemingly disparate topics, define and promote the state of scientific knowledge in these areas, and set the agenda for future work.  The volume presents the two main ways of looking at judgments over time: looking at how peoples thoughts about the future and the past affect their present states, and looking at the interplay over time among peoples thoughts, feelings, and behaviors." />
