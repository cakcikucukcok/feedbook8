  <title>The Drowning - E. J. Stauffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A honeymooning couple in Honolulu stops a woman from being murdered in the ocean. The woman, Danni, tells authorities she recognized her attacker. He is none other than Phillipe DeBain, and she believes he was intent on killing her. Too bad DeBain turns up dead in the morgue, apparently beaten to death before his body was dumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Hawaii detectives now deal with not only an assault and a murder but also the disappearance of a quarter-million dollars. First, how can investigators prove DeBain was Dannis attacker when hes now dead? Secondly, who would have wanted DeBain dead, and does it have anything to do with his alleged attack on an innocent woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeBain did, prior to his death, admit to getting rough with the girls he datedand Danni was one of them. Its possible she was out for revenge and hired someone to get rid of the man who wanted her dead  but is it probable? This investigation confounds even the most brilliant detective, but one thing is for sure: theres a murderer on the island who must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;" />
