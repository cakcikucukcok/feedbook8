  <title>Bus Stop - William Inge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cherie was a chanteuse. She said, “I call m&#39;self Cherie. Thass all the name ya need -- like Hidegarde. I won a amateur contest down in Joplin, Missouri, and that got me a job in a night club in Kanz City. But working in a night club ain&#39;t all roses...&quot;&lt;P&gt;
Bo Decker had his picture taken by Life magazine because he was a champion professional rodeo rider. Bo had heard about women only he&#39;d hardly ever seen one. Bo was a large, beautiful hunk of man -- but green as new grass when it came to Cherie.&lt;P&gt;
Bo and Cherie got together when they were stranded at a bus stop one night.&lt;P&gt;
Their story is one of high humor -- a mixture of brag, heartache, bluster, and the funniest tough love affair ever put on stage, screen, or between the covers of a book. It is filled with comedy, compassion and tenderness." />

The 1956 film of the same name was "opened up" in the beginning to include scenes on the bus and in places away from the diner.<br /><b><i>Bus Stop (William Inge play) - Wikipedia</i></b> | At least, that is what William Inge is able to convince us of in his three-act romance Bus Stop. A cowboy can lose his belligerence. A young girl can learn of romance from an unexpected source. A nightclub chanteuse can discover domesticity and a drunken lecher can mend his ways.<br /><b><i>Bus Stop by William Inge</i></b> | Bus Stop isn't read much, but it is performed frequently to packed audiences. It's surface is all 1950's naivete and blustering innocence, but the March wind quickly blows the surface away. This is really a play about lonely people who either don't have a home to go to, or would rather face a cold road than a cold room.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Bus Stop - William Inge</a> </h3></p><hr/>
