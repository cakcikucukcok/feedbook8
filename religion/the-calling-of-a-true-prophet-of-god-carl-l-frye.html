  <title>The Calling of a True Prophet of God - Carl L. Frye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you came so close to dying as I have, you tend to wonder why youre still here. The things I have experienced, the things that I have seen and heard, are extremely hard to accept, but they are facts. I am not greater than anyone. We all have an equal value to God. Some people have similar callings, but mine was more prophetic, angelic, and spiritual than most. 
I read about the calling of Elijah and Elisha, and I believe I can relate to that calling, as well as the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah chapter 6). I found myself so wrapped up in the flesh that I could not function in the spiritual realmbut God changed all that. He refined me like gold being mined and processed into bars. He molded me until I was ready to be restored, but yet I was still a work in progress. Believe it or not, everything that happened to me happened. And I do not believe that Satan sent me a strong delusion, because I believe what happened to me made me wiser, smarter, and stronger physically and spiritually. I have felt the presence of God so strong, I would shake all over when the anointing would pass over me. But I have also seen and heard real evil that Hollywood could not, or would not, copy. Rewa I evil is more dangerous than you will ever know or imagine, and if you do not pray up fast and mature in the word of God, it will oppress, possess your body, soul, mind, and spirit. 
I know by experience the danger of demonic oppression. There are no fictitious stories or delusional visions in this book. This is drama in real life! It is my prayer and desire that this book I have written will enlighten you to seek the truth, give you the knowledge you need to fight the forces of evil, and give you spiritual restoration in Jesus Christ. It will not bring you to perfection, because no man is perfect but God, but it will give you a better insight and perspective on what God commands the church (the body of Christ) and all the men and women of God to do. God can restore (Joel 2:25)." />
