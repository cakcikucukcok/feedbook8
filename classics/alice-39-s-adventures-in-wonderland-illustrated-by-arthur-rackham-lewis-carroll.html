  <title>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated by Arthur Rackham) - Lewis Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During a boat trip up the Isis River with Reverend Robinson Duckworth and the three young daughters of Henry Liddell, one of whom is named Alice, Lewis Carroll, the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, invents a story about a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure. Several years later this tale would be forever immortalized as “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” The story begins with Alice idly passing away the time next to a river when she sees a White Rabbit in a waistcoat with a pocket watch pass by. She follows the rabbit down the rabbit hole and ends up in the fantasy world of Wonderland. “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” is filled with a plethora of interesting and fantastical creatures. Along with the persistently tardy White Rabbit, Alice encounters a blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah, the mischievously grinning Cheshire Cat, a Mad Hatter, a March Hare, and a sleepy little Dormouse, whom she attends a tea party with, the King and Queen of Hearts, along with many other curious characters. Beloved my millions of children and adults ever since its first publication, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” is a classic tale of fantasy that has been cherished by readers ever since its first publication and will surely delight for many years to come. This edition is illustrated by Arthur Rackham and includes a biographical afterword." />
