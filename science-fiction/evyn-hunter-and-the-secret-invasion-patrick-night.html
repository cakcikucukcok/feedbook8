  <title>Evyn Hunter and the Secret Invasion - Patrick Night</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By all accounts, Evyn Hunter is just your average, unremarkable, and predictable thirteen-year-old boy. His biggest problem is trying to navigate the stormy waters of high school with his sanity and dignity intact. No oneespecially Evyn himselfreally expects him to do anything important with his life. (Well, almost no one. His first girlfriend, Chloe, thinks hes pretty sweet...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, Evyn wakes up with the terrifying realization that scores of people have disappeared in his beloved hometown of Newport, Californiaand no one knows why. His curiosity leads him into increasingly more dangerous situations, but his drive to solve the mystery is stronger than his fear of the unknown agents in dark suits who follow him everywhere. Who are they? Where did they come from? And why are they here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evyn and his friends are soon embroiled in a terrifying game of cat-and-mouse with the strange visitors. They must race against time to try to solve the bizarre disappearances before the mysterious agents stop them. Pushed to his limits, Evyn now has a choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can he face his fears and be the hero everyone needs? Or will he give up and prove to be just another unremarkable teenager?&lt;/p&gt;" />
