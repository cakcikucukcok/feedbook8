  <title>The Sea of the Dead - Barry Wolverton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An engrossing fantasy, a high-seas adventure, an alternate history epic&amp;#8212;this is the richly imagined and gorgeously realized third book in acclaimed author Barry Wolverton&amp;#8217;s Chronicles of the Black Tulip, perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;The Glass Sentence&lt;/em&gt; and the Books of Beginning series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the harrowing and life-changing events at the Dragon&amp;#8217;s Gate, Bren wants nothing more than to make his way back to England. Finding the answers to the great mysteries he&amp;#8217;d been chasing only found him questioning why he&amp;#8217;d ever pursued them in the first place, and now he&amp;#8217;s lost his best friend, forever. There&amp;#8217;s nothing left for him but to return home and hope his father hasn&amp;#8217;t given up on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just because Bren is done with adventure does not mean adventure is done with him. On his way to escape from China, Bren is gifted a rare artifact, with a connection to a place no one has set foot upon. Soon he&amp;#8217;s fallen in with a mysterious Indian noblewoman bent on discovering an ancient power and leading her country against colonial rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way home, it seems, is through helping her&amp;#8212;and as Bren wonders what she&amp;#8217;s willing to sacrifice in order to return home a hero, he must ask himself the same questions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
