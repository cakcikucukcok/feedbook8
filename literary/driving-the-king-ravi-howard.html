  <title>Driving the King - Ravi Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A daring and brilliant novel that explores race and class in 1950s America, witnessed through the experiences of Nat King Cole and his driver, Nat Weary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war is over, the soldiers are returning, and Nat King Cole is back in his hometown of Montgomery, Alabama, for a rare performance. His childhood friend, Nat Weary, plans to propose to his sweetheart, and the singer will honor their moment with a special song. While the world has changed, segregated Jim Crow Montgomery remains the same. When a white man attacks Cole with a pipe, Weary leaps from the audience to defend him&amp;#8212;an act that will lead to a ten-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the singer will not forget his friend and the sacrifice he made. Six months before Weary is released, he receives a remarkable offer: will he be Nat King Cole&amp;#8217;s driver and bodyguard in L.A.? It is the promise of a new life removed from the terror, violence, and degradation of Jim Crow Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weary discovers that, while Los Angeles is far different from the Deep South, it a place of discrimination, mistrust, and intolerance where a black man&amp;#8212;even one as talented and popular as Nat King Cole&amp;#8212;is not wholly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An indelible portrait of prejudice and promise, friendship and loyalty, &lt;em&gt;Driving the King&lt;/em&gt; is a daring look at race and class in pre-Civil Rights America, played out in the lives of two remarkable men.&lt;/p&gt;" />
