  <title>2.8 to 4.5 ... Assembly Required: A Blueprint to Building a Positive Workplace Culture - Keith W. Lazar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Think about the last time you assembled a model airplane, a bicycle, a piece of furniture, a jigsaw puzzle, or something as complex as a home theater system. Any of those tasks would be much easier if you had an instruction book-and the same is true when trying to build an excellent workplace culture. Keith W. Lazar shares the results from a company survey he conducted twenty years apart, focusing in on the findings of one key question: On a scale of one to five, with five being the best, how would you rate your satisfaction with working here? The first time the survey was conducted, respondents came back with an average response of 2.8. The second time, however, the result was 4.5. By identifying the challenges, failures, strategies, and successes on the road to 4.5, Lazar gives you the tools you need to truly dedicate yourself to the well-being of staff, advance your career, improve yourself, develop leadership skills, and build a transformative workplace culture." />
