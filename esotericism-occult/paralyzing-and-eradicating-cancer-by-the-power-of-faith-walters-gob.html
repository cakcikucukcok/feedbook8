      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paralyzing And Eradicating Cancer By The Power Of Faith is a divine medication that is able to paralyze and eradicate cancels and tumors for perfected healing. In this edition, the author brings out God&amp;#39;s prescription for our healing which is the Healing Word Of Faith(HWF). The author brings out God&amp;#39;s prescription for our healing which is the Healing Word Of Faith(HWF). The author helps to build your Faith from zero faith to the faith of a hero, a faith that will impair the multiplication power and growth of cancer cells and tumors and then paralyze and eradicate them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Have you been diagnosed with cancer? I have good news for you, your faith can be built to exempt you from the millions that are diagnosed with cancer annually. In the United States alone, more than one million six hundred people are been diagnosed with cancer annually as of 2016. For those without cancer, it is still required for them to get this book and build their faith while they are strong and healthy. With your faith built and rooted&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;Healing&amp;nbsp;Word&amp;nbsp;of Faith, you can stand the gap for someone suffering from terminal cancer and God will honor your faith and heal him. &amp;nbsp;In Mark 7:26-28, the Greek Woman stood the gap for her daughter and Jesus honor her faith and healed the daughter. In Matthew 8:5-13, Jesus by the reason of the Faith of the Centurion, healed his servant. By reason of your faith, God can intervene and heal your spouse, brother, sister, parents or even friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Faith building, especially faith in the healing Word of God is one of the greatest investments. It is what heals you from every sickness be it terminal so that you can enjoy your physical investment. Jesus paid the full price for your healing so that you can enjoy good health. The Bible say&amp;#39;s He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities,&amp;nbsp;the chastisement&amp;nbsp;of our peace came upon Him and by his stripes, we were healed. Just because Jesus paid the full price for your healing, healing is not automatic you work in divine healing just as the discovery of a medication for a particular ailment is not a guarantee that you are healed when you are diagnosed with an ailment&amp;nbsp;that has&amp;nbsp;medication. To be healed, you must take the medication as per the doctor prescription. The same is true with divine healing, The Scripture in Proverb 4:20-22 describes God&amp;#39;s &amp;nbsp;Word as medication, and like any medication must be taken as prescribed. The author helps to build your faith so that Word medication can produce for you. After many years of painful suffering, I was finally trained in the Faith and prayer ministry, after which the Lord called me to write this book and build the faith of his people. If there is one ministry that has been abused, it is the prayer ministry. Many Christians and even new convert are asked to pray and have faith to be healed as if it is easy to pray and faith without being trained. The Lord Jesus Christ, our perfect example in Scripture walk with the disciples for almost 3 years, the disciples watch him pray, yet could not copy his prayer lifestyle. It was not until Chapter Chapter 11 of the Gospel of st Luck that one of the disciples approached him and said, Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his disciples. If John the Baptist and Jesus Christ taught their disciples to pray then you must be taught to pray. Journey with me into this book and be taught to pray and your faith built, one that when unleashed against cancer cells and tumors will paralyze and eradicate them for perfected healing, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
