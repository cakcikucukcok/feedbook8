      <meta name="description" content="An innocent beauty looking for answers turns to a detective looking for vengeance&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;One day. One town. Three missing women. Things like this didn&#39;t happen in Culpepper. Except that they had&amp;#151;once before. Eleven years ago, young Braydon Thatcher was unable to stop a tragic murder, one that hit painfully close to home. Now a detective, Braydon can&#39;t help but notice the eerie similarities between the two crimes. But he has to focus on the present and keep distractions to a minimum. Distractions like Sophia Hardwick, who crashes into town like a Florida thunderstorm, demanding to know where her missing sister is. The attraction between them is nearly his undoing. But he has to protect her, because it&#39;s clear someone is resurrecting ghosts in order to punish Braydon. And if he lets his emotions for Sophia get the best of him, she could become yet another victim&amp;#133;" />
