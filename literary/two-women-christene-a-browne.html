  <title>Two Women - Christene A. Browne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bernice Archer lives in a low-income downtown neighborhood where she has raised her blind twin daughters, Eva and Ava, in relative isolation. Every night she tells them regurgitated bedtime stories, sometimes magical and often cautionary, about the dangers of the world outside their small apartment. Eva and Ava, now middle-aged, still wait for their mother?s stories with both excitement and suspicion, knowing that there is much they haven?t been told. When Bernice notices two new neighbors in their building, she is inspired to tell a new story. And so begins the saga of Violet and Rose, who Bernice believes were born at the exact same moment, hemispheres apart, and who share the same soul. Set in the 1970s, with a feeling of mystery and magic realism, readers will be swept up by Bernice&#39;s stories just as Eva and Ava are." />
