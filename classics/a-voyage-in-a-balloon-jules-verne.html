  <title>A Voyage in a Balloon - Jules Verne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pioneering science-fiction writer Jules Verne is the second most translated author of all time (after Agatha Christie.) This translation of his short story A Voyage in a Balloon first appeared in Sartain&amp;#39;s Union Magazine of Literature and Art in a May 1852 edition, making it the first of the French writer&amp;#39;s stories to be published in English. As Verne writes in this story: &amp;quot;May this terrific recital, while it instructs those who read it, not discourage the explorers of the routes of air.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jules Verne (8 February 1828 &amp;ndash; 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Verne was born in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father&amp;#39;s footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. His reputation is markedly different in Anglophone regions, where he has often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children&amp;#39;s books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels are often reprinted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking between Agatha Christie and William Shakespeare. He has sometimes been called the &amp;quot;Father of Science Fiction&amp;quot;, a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback." />
