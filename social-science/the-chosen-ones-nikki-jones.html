  <title>The Chosen Ones - Nikki Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How does one return to their community after a life peppered with drug charges, violent offenses, and trips to prison, all before adulthood? In &lt;I&gt;The Chosen Ones&lt;/I&gt;, sociologist and feminist scholar Nikki Jones shares the compelling story of a group of Black men living in San Francisco&amp;#39;s historically Black neighborhood, the Fillmore. Caught in the re-entry riptide, adolescent boys who have spent most of their teenaged years under carceral control return home, often on probation or parole. While some go back to jail or prison within weeks or months of their release, others strive to contribute to their community but find they are haunted by the ghosts of their destructive youth. Against all odds, these men work to atone for past crimes by reaching out to other Black men, young and old, with the hope of guiding them towards a better life. Yet despite their genuine efforts, neighbors still believe the men cannot change. With a poignant yet hopeful voice, Jones illustrates how neighborhood politics, everyday interactions with the police, and conservative Black gender ideologies shape the men&amp;rsquo;s ability to help their community and forgive themselves&amp;mdash;and how the work of redemption is truly a double-edged sword.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;" />
