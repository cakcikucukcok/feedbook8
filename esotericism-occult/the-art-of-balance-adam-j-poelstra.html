  <title>The Art of Balance - Adam J. Poelstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will find an insightful look into several subjects and ideas, things you find in the everyday as well as the deeply philosophical, presented in a way you may never have heard before. In our time, we often find ourselves on one extreme or the other, politically, ideologically, religiously, making relationships difficult. This book attempts to tackle some of the things hiding behind these differences in an attempt to find cohesion rather than dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue in our time is the way authority often behaves and our reaction to it. Teachers often tell us what to think, rather than how to think. We are told to believe something, not because weve been told why its believable but simply because they say so. Our reaction has been blunt, brutal honesty, as well as skepticism. A decent response to make, though it additionally separates us from one another. This book is an attempt to do some right where much has gone wrong, discussing ideas rather than forcing ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come away from this book with lots of new ideas and much to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
