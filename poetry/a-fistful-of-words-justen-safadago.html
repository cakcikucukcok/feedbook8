  <title>A Fistful of Words - Justen Safadago</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Fistful of Words became a work in progress after Sept 11. I was not born of a hardship and grew up with little issues that gave me this poetic voice. This was my only way to express what ideas and thinking process I was blessed with could be shown to the world. This book is just a compile of writings I have made from my youth to now. The interpretations of the writings come from the mind of the reader. I can only explain between the lines there are sexual references, political views, world view, religious phrases, life events, depression, hatred, rage and love in the text. But, these words are intended for the reader to capture the meaning after the reading. If no true meaning comes from one writing just keep reading to find the one that inspires or touches you when reading. This has been a lifelong dream to be able to create a book of how a mind can work when given the opportunity to express words in code. The code is simple to break if you just read and do not try to translate by each word. The meaning and purpose is for the reader to bring meaning from the text on a personal note. Do not be blind when reading the language of the words; create your own diction meaning. Let the writings bring meaning and understand it is only words, not fact." />
