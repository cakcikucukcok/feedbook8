  <title>Don&#39;t Call Me Poor - Evadene Stranske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is a person to do when peering in the face of deathor any difficult circumstance? What if that person is only fourteen years old? How can a mother rest in Gods sovereignty when His ways seem so hidden and confusing?&lt;p&gt;
Before encountering this crisis, Darryl came to believe that God is good and all His ways are best. Hearing a bleak prognosis with little hope for cure, Darryl believed that if God planned it that way, it was the very best for him! Living out the passion of the apostle Paul, Darryl became known as the boy whos not afraid to die. He accepted suffering with joy by remembering Jesuss pain tolerated for him on the cross. In his final words, he expressed, Jesus died for your sins and my sins. Im going to see Him! Even in his dying moments, he wanted others to experience the love of Jesus. His life demonstrated that joy comes from Jesus and is not dependent on circumstances. Life, suffering, and even death had a purpose because of a gracious and loving God. When his time came, he eagerly stepped into the presence of Jesus. His desire would be the same for you!&lt;p&gt;
                                                         ***&lt;p&gt;
Fantastic! As a pediatrician and as a parent, I urge you to read this book. Gods greatness is seen throughout as we observe real parents and a real adolescent struggling with very real tragedy. Devouring page after page, I was inspired with great lessons about parenting, godliness, grieving, and endurance. May we all grow to share Darryls eternal perspective.&lt;br&gt;

This book is a victorious cancer story without parallel. Darryl used suffering as a backboard for proclaiming the joy of Christian victory. His disease and demise are an excellent lesson to teach us that all preachers do not have a three piece suit and an ordination certificate. It is an easy read and will stimulate your own witness.&lt;br&gt;

Darryl never felt sorry for himself no matter how bad the physical pain. He was acutely aware of the pain Jesus suffered for our eternal salvation. This wonderful life-changing book touched my life and made me want to be more open to share my faith.&lt;br&gt;
Lorrie Waldroup LVN&lt;br&gt;
Clinic Nurse&lt;br&gt;
Covenant Village of Turlock&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Told with such authenticity, vulnerability, and sensitivity, this is not the story of love enshrined, but rather of love enfleshed. Inspiring to the very core, Darryls story as written on his mothers heart and shared on the printed page has a message which will be personalized in the life of every reader. Caring now for the chronically and terminally ill, Rose and I are once again ministered to greatly by these godly friends&lt;br&gt;
