  <title>The American Senator - Anthony Trollope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The heroine, Mary Masters, is the daughter of an attorney, and has been raised as a gentlewoman. Her stepmother is from a lower social order; believing it best for Mary, she pressures her strongly to accept a proposal from Lawrence Twentyman, a prosperous young yeoman farmer with aspirations to gentility. While Mary respects Twentyman for his excellent qualities, she feels that she cannot love him as a wife should a husband. She admires Reginald Morton, whose cousin is the squire of Bragton and thus one of the two major landowners of Rufford. Reginald admires Mary as well; but for most of the novel, each is ignorant of the other&#39;s feelings: Mary, as a gentlewoman, cannot take the initiative in such a matter; and Reginald, misinformed that Mary loves another, is unwilling to make an offer and have it rejected." />

Although not one of Trollope's better-known works, it is notable for its depictions of rural English life and for its many detailed fox hunting scenes. In its anti-heroine, Arabella Trefoil, it presents a scathing but ultimately sympathetic portrayal of a woman who has abandoned virtually all scruples in her quest for a husband.<br /><b><i>The American Senator - Wikipedia</i></b> | The American Senator of the title is actually not the main focus of the story, but more a vehicle through whose eyes Trollope exposes the highs and lows of British life of the period and indeed some of the flaws<br /><b><i>The American Senator by Anthony Trollope - Goodreads</i></b> | 'The American Senator' is the eighteenth novel by Anthony Trollope I've read over the last 2 or 3 years, and I must confess I simply cannot get enough of him.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The American Senator - Anthony Trollope</a> </h3></p><hr/>
