  <title>The Statuette - Brigitte Eagle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE STATUETTE is literary fiction, with a wisp of the paranormal. It tells the story of how a curious incident in the Madrid sky not only stuns most residents of the city but also brings 2 people  both seeking answers to 2 apparently unrelated questions  together.
One is Art, a daredevil freelance investigative journalist with a passion for the inexplicable. Convinced that contrary to what many television pundits are inferring, the event in the sky is far more than a mere atmospheric phenomenon, he sets out to investigate that strange appearance in the sky.
The other is Regina, a Nigerian curator who is lured to Spain by a group of con artists with the promise of a brilliant fresh start. Nevertheless, on arrival she is savagely bitten by reality. She is seeking redress for that deceit and answers to the sudden disappearance of her best friend when she stumbles across Art.
Following their apparent chance meeting they realise that to achieve their individual objectives, they need each other. Slowly, a curious sort of friendship evolves between them.
In the course of his investigation Art comes across Santi, an eccentric artist who is also a collector  he collects just about anything in the name of art. Incidentally, he is Reginas boss.
Interestingly, though each of these 3 individuals has a different interpretation of the phenomenon in the sky, they all share the same belief: the incident is absolutely significant. However, only one of them is aware of how much so and of its impact on their lives.
THE STATUETTE is multicultural too. Through Arts sometimes witty musings readers get glimpses into 2 societies: 
The Spanish societys sometimes laid-back attitude, its detestation of bureaucracy and its reluctance to comply with rules and regulations are reflected. 
The beliefs, generosity and fun-loving nature of the Nigerian society, as well as the endemic corruption and insecurity, are depicted. 
After reading THE STATUETTE you will never acquire any antiquity without inquiring about its provenance!" />
