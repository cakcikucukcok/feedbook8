  <title>A Poet&#39;s Kingdom - Joseph P. Policape</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Poet&#39;s Kingdom
A kingdom of words that serves the needs of its poetry citizens, A Poet&#39;s Kingdom is 
a head and heart rainbow of existence: happiness, sadness, pride, hope and displeasure, regret and perspective, grief and joy, the simple thankfulness of God, nature, and life; all are to be found in this new collection.  
Poet, writer, thinker, Joseph P. Policape was born in Haiti and arrived on these shores 
in the early 1980s. His higher education took place in Massachusetts with focus on business, Computer Technology, and theology, but the love of poetry had always been 
a permanent love. Author of three poetry collections, a short story book and a novel, Policape will also be publishing this year, a major work on his native country: A BEAUTIFUL AGONY: VISIONARIES AND FREEDOM FIGHTERS IN HAITIAN HISTORY. The courage of political and existential freedom is the raison d&#39;tre of this new collection." />
