  <title>What Did Eye See? - Charles G. P. Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="George ORourke had witnessed something but had no idea what he had seen. All he knew was that someone was trying to kill him for it. He and his wife were at risk, and after the second attempt on both their lives, they went into hiding. 
George and some of his old colleagues who had served with him in the UK Special Forces had to quickly work together. There was an underlying threat that had the potential to cause untold damage to Great Britains ability to host exhibitions, such as the one where some of the most precious diamonds in the world were due to be exhibited. There was also credible intelligence suggesting that an attack on London was being planned by an unknown group. 
It took painstaking work to realize that both events were linked to one manAfolabi Okorie. Although George had never met Okorie, George and his friend Stuart had been kidnapped some years earlier by an arms-smuggling group that was funded by Okorie. 
George and his colleagues found themselves in a race against time to prevent a catastrophe in London that could cost many lives and Britains credibility abroad." />
