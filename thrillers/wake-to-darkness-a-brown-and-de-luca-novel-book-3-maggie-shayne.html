  <title>Wake to Darkness (A Brown and De Luca novel, Book 3) - Maggie Shayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel de Luca’s uncanny sense of perception is the key to her success as a self-help celebrity. Even before she regained her sight, she had a gift for seeing people’s most carefully hidden secrets. But the secret she shares with Detective Mason Brown is one she has promised to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As for Mason, he sees Rachel more clearly than she’d like to admit. After a single night of adrenaline-fueled passion, they have agreed to keep their distance—until a string of murders brings them together again. Mason thinks that he can protect everyone he loves, including Rachel, by taking them to a winter hideaway, but danger follows them up the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As guests disappear from the snowbound resort, the race to find the murderer intensifies. Rachel knows she’s a target. Will acknowledging her feelings for Mason destroy her—or save them both and stop a killer?&lt;/p&gt;
