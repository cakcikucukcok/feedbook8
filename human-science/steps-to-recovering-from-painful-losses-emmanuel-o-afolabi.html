  <title>Steps to Recovering from Painful Losses - Emmanuel O. Afolabi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The realities of life is that it has its challenges and nobody is excluded from its vicissitude as Isaiah through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit prophesied (putting it succinctly) in Isaiah 43:2 when (not if) you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you. And King Nebuchadnezzar, it was in Daniel chapter 3 verse 24 who observed in practical terms what Isaiah prophesied.
There is no accident in this life (i.e things just dont happen), nothing happens without God knowing about it, He either directs or permits it (Matt. 10:29 &amp; 30), hence the need to factor Him in, in whatsoever situations or circumstances you are expecting recovery from and this is what this book is about.
The book is about how the Almightiness of God can be brought to bear on any given unpleasantries in your life and is therefore a must read, and a good resource tool for every sincere and serious minded
Christian.
