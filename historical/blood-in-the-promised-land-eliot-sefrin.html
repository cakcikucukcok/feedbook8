  <title>Blood in the Promised Land - Eliot Sefrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is 1943, and World War II rages on battlefields across the globe. But in America, another bloody, divisive battle rages as stepped-up wartime production lures legions of poor blacks from the rural South to defense jobs in the Northto a so-called promised land of opportunity. The wartime migration has a profound impact, transforming Americas cities into both arsenals for democracy and cauldrons of racial conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Set against this conflicted backdrop, two men embark on separate journeys to begin a new chapter in their lives. Roosevelt Turner is a poor black migrant who flees the Jim Crow South to work in Pittsburghs bustling steel mills. Jacob Perlman is a Jewish physician forced to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. As each seeks to escape his harrowing past and rebuild his life in a country struggling to fulfill its own promise, their paths unwittingly cross during a violent racial conflict. In an instant, their destinies are reshaped forever.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;As Roosevelt and Jacob are thrust into the crucible of the civil rights movement, they courageously join forces in an effort to crush a terrorist hate group and exorcise the ghosts from their pasts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
