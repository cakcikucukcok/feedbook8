      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Cora Carmack follows up her trio of hits&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Losing It, Faking It,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Finding It&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;with this thrilling first novel in an explosive series bursting with the Texas flavor, edge, and steamy romance of &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Texas, two things are cherished above all else&amp;#8212;football and gossip. My life has always been ruled by both. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas Cole loathes football. That&amp;#39;s what happens when you spend your whole childhood coming in second to a sport. College is her time to step out of the bleachers, and put the playing field (and the players) in her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But life doesn&amp;#39;t always go as planned. As if going to the same college as her football star ex wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough, her father, a Texas high school coaching phenom, has decided to make the jump to college ball&amp;#8230; as the new head coach at Rusk University. Dallas finds herself in the shadows of her father and football all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carson McClain is determined to go from second-string quarterback to the starting line-up. He needs the scholarship and the future that football provides. But when a beautiful redhead&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;literally&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;falls into his life, his focus is more than tested. It&amp;#39;s obliterated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas doesn&amp;#39;t know Carson is on the team. Carson doesn&amp;#39;t know that Dallas is his new coach&amp;#39;s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And neither of them know how to walk away from the attraction they feel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
