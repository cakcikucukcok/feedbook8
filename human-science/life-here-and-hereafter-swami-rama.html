  <title>Life Here and Hereafter - Swami Rama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;What exists after death? Explain it to me,&quot; insists the young student Nachiketa as he puzzles over the supreme mystery in the Kathopanishad. Swami Rama&#39;s penetrating commentary on the ensuing dialogue between Nachiketa and Yama, King of Death, reveals a clear, profound philosophy of death and immortality. Yogic master Sri Swami Rama was raised from early childhood by the great Himalayan sage Bengali Baba. In Life Here and Hereafter: Kathopanishad, Swami Rama draws upon the wisdom he gathered from the hidden Himalayan adepts with whom he studied, as well as his mastery of esoteric yogic practices, to share his experiential knowledge of death and what lies beyond. This book is a practical guide to understanding the various levels of consciousness on the path to conquering fear and unraveling the mysteries of life, death, and immortality. In Swami Rama’s words: &quot;Those who attain the highest knowledge and immortality by reaching the state of superconsciousness, they alone can unravel the mystery of death.&quot;" />
