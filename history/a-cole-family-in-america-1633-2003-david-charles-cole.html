  <title>A Cole Family in America (1633-2003) - David Charles Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Family history of various qualities have been written about the dependents of Daniel, Job and John Cole who first appear in the records of  Plymouth Plantation in 1633.  This detailed genealogy corrects errors discovered in previous publications and carefully documents one branch of the family leading from Daniel Cole through the first 11 generations. The text also traces family members back to England, details how they journeyed to America, confirms marital connections with several Mayflower voyagers, and follows the family as it expands and settled throughout the country.  It is rich in painstakingly researched facts and includes a genealogical tree tracing the line, a full index of names, illustrations, maps and extensive bibliography.
&lt;P&gt;
The work, researched over a 10 year period, makes use of more than 80 references listed in the bibliography.  In addition to the Cole family, particulars on the Chandler, Collier, Cullen, Doane, Fuller, Hopkins, Hyde, Kimmich, Lyons, McCrimmon, Murray, Rogers, Smalley, Snow and Taylor families are found in its pages, along with facts on many other families that settled in the northeastern United States.  This scholarly work will be of benefit to every genealogical researcher, serving as a valuable reference and research tool." />
