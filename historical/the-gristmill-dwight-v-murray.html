Besides, keep&amp;rsquo;n things clean ain&amp;rsquo;t really all that hard, no how, not wid my Mama and Daddy both sleep&amp;rsquo;n down there.

Now I didn&amp;rsquo;t say nothin&amp;rsquo; mind you . . . jus&amp;rsquo; stood there an&amp;rsquo; dun&amp;rsquo; my best to be quiet, but he up and said sumpt&amp;rsquo;n first. Reckon I weren&amp;rsquo;t near as quiet as I thought I was. &amp;ldquo;Bet there&amp;rsquo;s a story just waiting down there to be told,&amp;rdquo; he &amp;nbsp;finally said, and then he tole me his name. Said it was Harold Murray. Yes Sir, &amp;ldquo;Murray&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; what he said, an&amp;rsquo; he asked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me what be my name.
