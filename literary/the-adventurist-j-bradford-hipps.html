  <title>The Adventurist - J. Bradford Hipps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the anonymous office park of a modern software company, whip-smart software engineer Henry Hurt is a man in the middle: of life, of career, and of self-assessment. Henry is mired in his corporate responsibilities until his deathless office existence is torpedoed by the loss of his mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overcome by &quot;the pall,&quot; Henry seeks escape in a quest for love and purpose, which is occasioned by a crisis in his company&#39;s fortunes. Dodging an Iago-like rival, he finds love with a colleague in his department, endangers his bond with his family, and finally confronts the single urgent question of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Adventurist&lt;/i&gt; is about relationships: Henry has complicated ones with his sister, Gretchen, who has stayed at home with their father; his lover Jane, a sleek and efficient mirror image of Henry; and a tantalizing potential girlfriend, Madison, the ultimate free spirit. But his relationship to the responsibilities in that anonymous office park may change his fortunes even more than the women in his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
