  <title>The Canyon&#39;s Edge - Nancy Nielson Redd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Set in the hauntingly beautiful desert landscapes of the Southwest . . . Redds novel is both well-paced and well-written. What really makes this book stand out is her blending of Navajo practices and worldview . . . along with detailed descriptions of Sedona and many of its New Age beliefs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;- The US Review of Books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;When MAGGIE stumbles over a corpse in Sedona, she discovers murders that reach from Mexico to Sedona to the Navajo reservation. Tormented by self-doubt after being left by her husband of 25 years, she is forty-seven years old, a personnel director and counselor in Page, Arizona, with two adult children. Her best friends, CHAR and Victor (the father to half-Navajo Tiahna), invite her to Sedona. She expects her retreat to be all about her until she stumbles over a corpse in the courtyard of Chars art gallery, revealing that her friends have problems deeper than her own. She lets go of her problems to try to solve the murders. She succeeds despite more than one attempt on her life. Her commitment becomes the key to getting her life back on track.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
