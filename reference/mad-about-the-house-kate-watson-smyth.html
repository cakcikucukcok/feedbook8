  <title>Mad about the House - Kate Watson-Smyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book of the UK&#39;s No.1 interiors blog, madaboutthehouse.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding on her award-winning blog, Kate Watson-Smyth shares a wealth of experience in home design to help you make the most of your space, be it a house, apartment or single room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packed full of ideas and inspiration for every budget, work through your home room by room with Kate’s expert and practical tips and tricks that ensure every corner reaches its maximum potential. As well as her top 10 design hacks, Kate reveals the rules of rug layout, explains how to buy a sofa, and shows you how to get the lighting right in every room. Learn how to decorate your home with style and confidence, select colours that work, make the most of small spaces and create the perfect zones for relaxation, entertaining and work – sometimes all in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your style, &lt;em&gt;Mad About The House&lt;/em&gt; is a must-have for anyone who is interested in interior design and who wants to make their house a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;‘A smart, savvy, fun book stuffed full of top tips to help you make your home your own.’ - Michelle Ogundehin, Editor at Large, ELLE Decoration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;‘Kate Watson-Smyth writes with great flair and humour, but what I Iove about her is that she encompasses core design principles, whilst giving people a chance to form their own opinions and see things in a different light.’ - Kelly Hoppen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;‘I am totally addicted to this blog.’ - Professor Green&lt;/p&gt;" />
