  <title>Bencher Family Series Bundle - Inara Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bencher Family Series Bundle (Entangled Indulgence) by Inara Scott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules of Negotiation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a no-strings attached fling, NYC&#39;s most eligible bachelor, Brit Bencher, vows to make a high-powered corporate attorney, Tori Anderson, feel like a woman. But what will she do when he decides he won&#39;t take &quot;one night stand&quot; for an answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Boss&#39;s Fake Fiance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No relationships, that&#39;s billionaire Garth Solen&#39;s rule--especially not with a woman like his new employee Melissa Bencher, who thinks with her heart and not her head. But all bets are off when Melissa tries to make her jerk ex-boyfriend jealous by suggesting that she&#39;s dating her gorgeous boss. The game is clear: for one month, they play the part of an engaged couple, and then they part ways. No emotions. No entanglements. But when it comes to matters of the heart, Melissa&#39;s never been good at following the rules...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Falling for Mr. Wrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelsey is as far from Ross Bencher&#39;s ideal as a woman can get, but she continues to bewitch him at every turn. As a single father of three, Ross knows the kind of woman he needs: someone predictable, reliable, and safe; someone who can give his kids the security they deserve. Someone completely different from Kelsey, his temporary nanny, who only has the Himalayan climbing expedition on her mind. She knows that she can&#39;t afford any second-guessing, attachments, or distractions, but try telling that to her heart when Ross&#39;s blue eyes and strong hands leave her gasping... and questioning everything she&#39;s ever known about love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
