  <title>Speaking Game - Clint Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being an effective, powerful, and entertaining speaker is the best thing you can do for your career and your personal power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this special 7-Figure Speaker Training &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo; (complete with videos you can get free at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.SpeakingGame.com&quot;&gt;www.SpeakingGame.com&lt;/a&gt;) I&amp;rsquo;m going to deliver to you the lowest hanging fruit, the easiest stuff you can implement today and forever to get better results from your speaking. These tips, tricks and techniques will help you have more impact, influence and income as a result of what you say and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how you say it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking is a skill that can be learned and improved. It is one that must be practiced, rehearsed, worked at alone, with other people, in private rooms, on stages, at dinner tables, in conference rooms, anywhere and everywhere you get an opportunity to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book and the BONUS Training Videos at www.SpeakingGame.com will help you maximize your impact, your level of influence, and your actual income by positioning yourself and performing as &amp;ldquo;someone special.&amp;quot; The more &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; people think you are, the more they are going to pay you. You can and must become more special in the eyes of your customers and prospects if you want to make Those Illusive Big Bucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As PART of this &amp;ldquo;7-Figure Speaker Training,&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; you&amp;rsquo;re going to learn The Speaking Game. Every waking minute of your life can be much more fun if you make SPEAKING into a game. The whole purpose of The Speaking Game is to make your life more fun, and to make it more fun for your &amp;ldquo;audience&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; whether you are speaking to your child, your coworkers, your boss, ten people in a board room, 100 people in a conference room, a thousand people in a theater, or even 10,000 people in an arena &amp;mdash; as many of my students do every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like my great mentor, Dan Kennedy, the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done for myself was to become good at public speaking. Power is unconsciously handed to the person who &amp;ldquo;steps up&amp;quot; and communicates with confidence, skill, and entertainment value built into their performance. That&amp;rsquo;s why speaker training is so important. Your ability to excel as a speaker is going to massively differentiate you from everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not want people to give you money when you speak; you may just want them to take an action. Getting people to give you money is probably one of the hardest things to get a person to do. If you can get people to give you money you can probably get them to do just about anything. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m teaching this, because I know how to get people to hand me money immediately after I speak, which is harder than just about anything&amp;mdash; and I&amp;rsquo;m better at it than 99% of the National Speakers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book REVEALS ALL THE SECRETS of what I do to get people to give me lots of money,&lt;/strong&gt; all the lowest hanging fruit of being a 7-Figure Speaker. I hope you appreciate these gifts, and let me know how they help you have more Influence, Inpact, and Income.&lt;/p&gt;" />
