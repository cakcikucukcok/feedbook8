Dealing with the demands of the project itself is almost as challenging as navigating the confusing culture of his new employer, a Belgian firm called Perfect Spring. Things are finally beginning to make sense for Troywhen he suddenly disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His young wife, Janice, enlists the help of Barbara Cummings of the Chamber of Commerce of Dyer County and police detective Jack Beasley. Together, they soon uncover dark truths behind the Perfect Spring project. Troy may have been involved in some shady deals with local contractors, landowners, Belgian operators, consulting companies, and the powerful and arrogant good-old-boy network of Dyer County. The trio try to interpret how seemingly disparate cluesextortion, bribery, falsification of soil tests, attempts to fix construction contracts, and romantic affairs that may or may not be interwoven with business interestsmay fit into the big picture. They find themselves ensnared in a perplexing web of international intrigue, jealousy, greed, and abuse of powercomplicated further by a budding romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of suspects is long and heavy, and theories abound. As they unravel the mystery of Troys involvement and disappearance, a new mystery emerges. Is Troy really dead? If so, who killed himand if not, where is he, and why is he hiding? What they learn will shake their community to the core.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
