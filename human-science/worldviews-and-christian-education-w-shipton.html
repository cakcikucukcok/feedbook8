  <title>Worldviews and Christian Education - W. Shipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christs instruction to his disciples was to witness to others about his plan of salvation. This may be relatively easy when it involves our contemporaries and peers. But when we are working with people from a different cultural background or belief system, it can be difficult or seemingly impossible.
In Worldviews and Christian Education, editors W. A. Shipton, E. Coetzee, and R. Takeuchi have brought together works by experts in cross-cultural religious education. The authors and editors have a wealth of personal experience in presenting the gospel to individuals with various worldviews that differ greatly from those held by Christians who take the Bible as authoritative. They focus on the beliefs and issues associated with witnessing to seekers for truth coming from backgrounds as diverse as animism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Marxism, Taoism, and postmodernism. 
The emphasis is on educational settings, but the sensitivities highlighted and lessons learned are applicable to situations outside this area. Leaders, pastors, teachers, and laypersons will find valuable conceptual models, practical ideas, and bibliographic references presented here.
Worldviews and Christian Education challenges all readers to be faithful to the biblical worldview and to approach everyone with sensitivity, so that, like the apostle Paul, they may reach some." />
