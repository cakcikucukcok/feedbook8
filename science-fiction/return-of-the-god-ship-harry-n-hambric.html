  <title>Return of the God Ship - Harry N Hambric</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Senior battle craft pilot Ha, a blob of intelligent pure energy is tasked to find or create new beings capable of melding with Has species to replace physical bodies taken from them. 
Nearly a billion years ago, Ha scattered ancient life-seeds, provided by his Species Council of Elders onto a young planet earth, and created an experiment station. We are its product. 
Ha defends the planet from destruction by the Dark Force and the human Apex Beings themselves. The earthlings have evolved to a state of acceptance. 
Ha is a magnificent Warrior Pilot, but he is not perfect. He makes mistakes, costing many human lives, manages to vanquish all intruders, and routinely answers to the God Council for his misdeeds. 
His ability to communicate with the Apex Beings under his care teaches Ha much about the future of the two species." />
