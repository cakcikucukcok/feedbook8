  <title>Storm Warning - Dandi Daley Mackall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written by bestselling author Dandi Daley mackall, in this series girls use Internet technology to unite and connect in powerful new ways. Discover a world where girls come together from completely different backgrounds and beliefs to start a journey of faith and self-discovery. Storm Novelo can&amp;rsquo;t understand why she&amp;rsquo;s messing up more now than before she became a Christian. Believing she&amp;rsquo;s at least partly to blame for her dad&amp;rsquo;s depression, Storm is determined to make him proud by joining the Quiz Bowl team, a move that pits her against Cameron Worthington the Third and teammates who&amp;rsquo;ll do everything they can to see her fail. Storm comes to understand that she&amp;rsquo;s more conscious of her faults because she&amp;rsquo;s growing in Christ. DANDI DALEY MACKALL won her first writing contest when she was ten years old with fifty words on why she wanted to be a batboy. She won, but they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let a girl be a batboy. It was her first taste of rejection. She bounced back and has since published 400 books. Dandi lives in rural West Salem, OH, and enjoys her husband and kids, who will still, on occasion, be up for a game of family softball.&lt;/p&gt;" />
