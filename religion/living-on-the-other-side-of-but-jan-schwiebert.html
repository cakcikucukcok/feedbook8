  <title>Living on the Other Side of But - Jan Schwiebert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a story and, within that story, are pages that reveal failure, rejection, shame, guilt, and discouragement, to name a few. There are things that we did or were done to us that have held us captive. We struggle to see ourselves as Christ sees us because we have labeled ourselves or allowed others to label us. &lt;br /&gt;
As believers, the good news is that those chapters have been covered by the love and forgiveness of our Savior. We now have a new identity, a new life, a new freedom because of what Jesus has done and is doing in our lives. The challenge becomes embracing all he has provided and living in our new identity. &lt;br /&gt;
The message of this book is that God has a better way for us to live, as revealed in the Word. It is revealed to us in the little word but. Such a little word, but such a powerful truth. But for Jesus we would be without hope, without joy, without purpose, and without peace; bound by sin; living a defeated and fruitless life. Jesus makes it possible for all that to change. It is learning to live on the other side of but.&lt;/p&gt;" />
