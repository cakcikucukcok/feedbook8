  <title>From Here to Maternity: A Personal Account of Infertility, Ivf &amp; Adoption - Kylie Doust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After three years and a total of nine embryo transfers, Glenn and I are hanging up our saddles ... For many, three years might seem an insufficient effort, but I am tired. My body is tired, my mind is tired and most of all my heart is tired. I still believe that IVF is a modern, medical miracle ... But I no longer believe it will be our miracle.&#39;  What happens when the quest for a family seems to bring only tears and despair? As Kylie and her husband Glenn discovered you simply pick yourself up, take a deep breath and carry on.  &#39;As harsh as it seems, the adoption process in Western Australia can only be described as excruciating: intrusive, intense, bureaucratic and judgemental.&#39;  Kylie&#39;s struggle to conquer the intricacies and inconsistencies of the adoption process push both her and Glenn to the limits of their endurance, and just when all seems lost they are handed a lifeline that sees their hope of becoming parents flicker back to life.  &#39;Is it bad news?&#39; &#39;No, it is very good news ... we have a baby for you, a little boy.&#39;  Honest, perceptive and deeply personal &#39;From Here to Maternity&#39; is a warm and ultimately joyful story about one couple&#39;s determination to overcome infertility and bureaucracy and become a family against all the odds." />
