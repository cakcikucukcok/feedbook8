  <title>Galahad and I Thought of Daisy - Edmund Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From one of the leading literary critics of his generation comes the first of Edmund Wilson&#39;s three novels, &lt;i&gt;I thought of Daisy&lt;/i&gt;, published together with his short story &quot;Galahad.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Set in Greenwich Village in the 1920s, Edmund Wilson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;I Thought of Daisy&lt;/i&gt;  tells the coming of age story of a young man living a bohemian life in Greenwich Village in the 1920s, and of his heartfelt relationship with a chorus girl he meets at a party. Fictional sketches drawn from real-life literary figures are scattered throughout, including John Dos Passos and Wilson&#39;s lover, Edna St. Vincent Millay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;What needs to be [said] is how good, if ungainly, &lt;i&gt;Daisy &lt;/i&gt;is, how charmingly and intelligently she tells of the speakeasy days of a Greenwich Village as red and cozy as a valentine, of lamplit islands  where love and ambition and drunkenness bloomed all at once. The fiction writer in Wilson was real, and his displacement is a real loss.&quot; - John  Updike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
