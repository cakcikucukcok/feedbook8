  <title>Mathematics Rebooted - Lara Alcock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Would you like to understand more mathematics?  Many people would.  Perhaps at school you liked mathematics for a while but were then put off because you missed a key idea and kept getting stuck.  Perhaps you always liked mathematics but gave it up because your main interest was music or languages or science or philosophy.  Or perhaps you studied mathematics to advanced levels, but have now forgotten most of what you once knew.  Whichever is the case, this book is
for you.  It aims to build on what you know, revisiting basic ideas with a focus on meaning.  Each chapter starts with an idea from school mathematics - often primary school mathematics - and gradually builds up a network of links to more advanced material.  It explores fundamental ideas in depth,
using insights from research in mathematics education and psychology to explain why people often get confused, and how to overcome that confusion.  For nervous readers, it will build confidence by clarifying basic ideas. For more experienced readers, it will highlight new connections to more advanced material.  Throughout, the book explains how mathematicians think, and how ordinary people can understand and enjoy mathematical ideas and arguments.  If you would like to be better informed about
the intrinsic elegance of mathematics, this engaging guide is the place to start." />
