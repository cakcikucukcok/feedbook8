  <title>The Veil of the Mountain Mist - Z H Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A mystery suspense thriller, a novel that will give you the insight to belief more than your imagination.&lt;br&gt;
A very gripping and powerful theme it has all the ingredients of modern and traditional life, destiny and the unknown.    &lt;br&gt;
Set in the hearts of Kashmir and Pakistan, this story provides an amazing and cultural backdrop into the mystery and magnificence of this part of the world; deemed a &#39;Paradise on Earth&#39;.&lt;br&gt;
On a trip to a rural village in Kashmir for his next consignment as a computer engineer from Lahore, Amir whilst taken aback by the alluring scenery, is astonished to find before him an even more alluring woman, Gori.&lt;br&gt;
Lost and tired; Amir, with the help of this enchanting lady arrives comfortably at his destination and completes his consignment.&lt;br&gt;
On return to Lahore a happily married Amir is greeted with open arms from his wife and soul mate Anny. 
Upon asking about the particulars of his journey, Anny  becoming aware of her husband&#39;s acquaintance with Gori and learning of her beauty and excellence becomes jealous beyond compare. Amir however revoking his story in an effort to calm her jealously pulls his wife back and reiterates his boundless love for her, and her only.&lt;br&gt;
After receiving a lucrative offer which could change their lives for ever, Amir is beckoned to Egypt the following day for a consignment unlike any other he has carried out before. &lt;br&gt;
After Amir&#39;s exit, Anny all alone yet again and missing her husband after just one night of re-acquaintance is shocked to find an enviously beautiful yet poor and destitute looking girl at the door. Anny is baffled even further at the mention of her husband&#39;s name coming from a complete stranger.&lt;br&gt;
Overcome with clemency for the girl, invites her into her house and decides to accommodate her until her husbands return.&lt;br&gt;
Is it not strange that lives and lifestyles commonly taken for granted can be upturned into catastrophic turmoil by a simple knock on the door.&lt;br&gt;
But every knocking door must be answered... right?&lt;br&gt;" />
