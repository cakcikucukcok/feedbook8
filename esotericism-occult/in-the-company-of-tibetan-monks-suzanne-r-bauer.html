  <title>In the Company of Tibetan Monks - Suzanne R. Bauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Suzanne agreed to host a few of the seven Tibetan monks when they visited Ohio on their 2012 World Peace Cultural Tour. Due to a last minute change of
    plans, she and her husband John hosted all of the monks and their driver for nine days in their home. Although Suzanne and John are world travelers, they
    knew little about Tibet and Buddhism. Hosting the monks became an incredible adventure as Suzanne and John maneuvered through unchartered waters. Their
    friends said this was an opportunity for them to step out of their comfort zone. Upon reflection, it was more accurate to say they stepped into a comfort
    zone. When the monks entered their home, they also stepped into their hearts. Being in the company of these Tibetan monks was a life-changing experience.
    Suzanne and John were  and continue to be  overwhelmed with gratitude for having been placed in a circumstance where this experience literally came
    through their front door.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Many color photographs help to tell the story of this wonderfully unexpected cultural experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    All proceeds from the sale of this book are donated to the work of the Gaden Jangtse Monastery in India, where the monks reside, and Merging Hearts
    Holistic Center, the organization that sponsored the monks during their stay in Canton, Ohio.
