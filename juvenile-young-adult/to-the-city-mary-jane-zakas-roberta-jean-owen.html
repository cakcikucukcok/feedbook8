  <title>To the City - Mary Jane Zakas, Roberta Jean Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roberta and William have been putting their winter food in storageapples, potatoes, and squash, to name a few. After a hard days work, they have decided to reward themselves with an overnight trip to the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They keep an Adventure Book, going to special places from A to Z. Theyve worked their way up to P, so theyll make a special trip while in town to eat at the Plazia restaurant. Roberta and William have a list of exactly what they need and want to do while theyre in the citytime for shopping and fun. A life-threatening event begins their trip, but when things go well, they go really well. On their way home, a shortcut on the scenic route takes them to an unexpected place and causes an unusual purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this childrens book, a couple goes to the city to spend some time shopping and having fun, but end up having quite an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrated verse features an appendix of facts about key elements in the story to initiate self-guided learning. A second appendix, STRETCH2SMART, is an interactive experience to help parents make reading fun for their children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
