      <meta name="description" content="Into Her World is a glimpse into the life and creative imagination of your not-so-typical Texas girl. As you will discover through the poems, songs, short stories, and letters based off the chaos and craziness God throws at you. Through weathering the various storms, you can discover you may not be the only person traveling on the same storms. Ultimately, we can take the lessons we learn from our own personal experiences and help others in their time of need. With each of the fourteen chapters, you will be exposed to the innermost thoughts of J. Ko. Each chapter tells of an experience or people in her life who have impacted her into the person she has become and will become. Ideally in each chapters poem or story, you will have the opportunity to find out what it is like to deal with heartache, death, life, happiness, sadness, and so much more emotion and you will be able to relate to the pieces. No matter if youre a believer, nonbeliever, male, female, young, or old, youll find that Into Her World is one of the most unique collections of poems and stories and find a poem or story worth memorizing." />
