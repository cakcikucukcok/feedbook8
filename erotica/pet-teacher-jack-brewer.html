  <title>Pet Teacher - Jack Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is said that living well is the best revenge, and this book illustrates that. A nasty high school student blackmails a teacher into having sex with her and, when he enjoys it, tries to make him do humiliating things for her gratification. The plan backfires, and the teacher has some great sex and finds love, much to the chagrin of the extortionist.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
It was Friday afternoon, and Mike Harris was about to leave the school when he was stopped by Monica, accompanied by another young woman. &amp;quot;Hi, Mike. I hope you didn&amp;#39;t have any other plans for tonight because you have a date with us.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Us?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, me and Jenna here.&amp;quot; Monica&amp;#39;s companion, even though she was smiling, was thin and unattractive, with short stringy brown hair. Mike had seen her in the hallway, but had never taken any notice of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Glad to meet you Mike,&amp;quot; Jenna said, offering her hand. Her other hand held a zippered bag. &amp;quot;Monica&amp;#39;s told me about you and we&amp;#39;re gonna have some fun tonight.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Monica, what is this about?&amp;quot; Mike responded, not shaking the offered hand. &amp;quot;I never agreed to service your friends. Or you either, for that matter.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have any choice, Mike, if you want to stay out of prison. Speaking of that, my friend is eighteen years old so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that with her. Now, you go on home and we&amp;#39;ll be over to join you in about an hour.&amp;quot; She knew she was holding all the trumps and all the aces and the history teacher would not dare disobey her.&lt;br /&gt;
Mike knew it too. He had been blackmailed into having sex with Monica by her threat to claim he had forced her to come to his apartment and give in to his demands. He knew her story might not be believed but there was no guaranty of that, especially with certain facts about his background that would almost certainly have become public if any such claim had been made. At the very least, he would be fired and probably barred from teaching, maybe forever. And sex with Monica wasn&amp;#39;t the worst thing in the world. He had actually gotten a considerable amount of pleasure from their first time together, but he was still nervous about being found out. Mike was also not at all happy about another person being there and wondered what she would want.&lt;br /&gt;
Slightly more than hour after the encounter in the school hallway, the buzzer next to the door sounded. &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; Mike responded, although he was sure who it was.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Monica and Jenna, Mike. Now let us in.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Mike pressed the button to unlock the door. A few minutes later, the two young women walked through his apartment door and Monica locked and bolted it behind them. She was in charge and wanted everybody to know it. &amp;quot;Hi again, Mike. You&amp;#39;re not acting very glad to see us.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Does it matter?&amp;quot;" />
