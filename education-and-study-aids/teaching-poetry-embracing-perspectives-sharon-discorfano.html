  <title>Teaching Poetry, Embracing Perspectives - Sharon Discorfano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book serves as a practical guide, for teachers of middle-school students as well as higher grade levels, that provides clear and fully-developed lesson plans and activities that use the teaching of poetry reading and writing as a vehicle for developing students&amp;rsquo; own creativity and appreciation for diversity. The combination of theory and practice sets this book apart from other books, in addition to an original four-step method of making sense of poems. The book is divided into two parts: the first focuses on the critical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of poems; the second focuses on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of poems, using different forms. Both work towards &amp;ldquo;the bigger picture&amp;rdquo; of developing students&amp;rsquo; ability to engage in respectful discourse and to view multiple perspectives as enriching rather than competing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
