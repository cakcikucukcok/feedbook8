      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A MAN WITH A PAST…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cruz Rivera is on his last second chance. He can&#39;t afford to blow it by falling for the beautiful blonde widow who just hired him to fix up her family&#39;s New Mexico property. If he&#39;s going to get back on the rodeo circuit, Cruz needs to focus. Besides, a sweet single mom like Sara Mendez can do better than someone with Cruz&#39;s troubled history.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sara isn&#39;t making it easy for Cruz to keep his distance. He&#39;s a man of many secrets, but Sarah sees only good in his warm brown eyes. Though Cruz knows he should move on before Sara discovers the truth about his past, he can&#39;t leave the closest thing to a home he&#39;s ever known. Cruz is the only man Sara wants–can he become the one she deserves?&lt;/p&gt;
