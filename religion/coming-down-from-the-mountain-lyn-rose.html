  <title>Coming Down from the Mountain - Lyn Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Born into a strict Catholic family, author Lyn Rose grew up believing her life was destined to be devoted to God. Eager to attend Mass at any chance, by age thirteen Lyn enrolled in a Juniorate, a boarding school to prepare her for life as a nun. When she finished at age sixteen, her dream was shattered when the head nun told her mum she was too happy to be a nun.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Believing her devotion was meant to take a different path, Lyn became a wife and mother. She was actively involved in parish life and spent twenty years working in various agencies of the church. While her passion for pastoral care grew, her belief in the church started to falter. She witnessed, and personally experienced, the church failing in its primary role of caring for its people.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Then in 2007, while on retreat in Assisi, Italy, Lyn had a vision that changed her life. She discovered a God of lovea God separate from the oppressiveness of the Catholic Church. In &lt;i&gt;Coming Down from the Mountain&lt;/i&gt;, Lyn shares the story of her life journey and how she found the power of forgiveness and the joy of experiencing Gods unconditional love without fear or guilt.&lt;/P&gt;" />
