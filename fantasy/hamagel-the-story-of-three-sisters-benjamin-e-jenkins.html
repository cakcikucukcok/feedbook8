  <title>Hamagel: the Story of Three Sisters - Benjamin E. Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The trek to Mount Mandara has not been easy for three sisters, a squad of Arihanta escorts, a Sadhu guide, their foot servants, and a half-crazy MoG. Days of secret travel have given way to weeks, and weeks to months. Now, as the group finally arrives at their destination, the hidden purpose for their travel is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three sisters, who are on a vital mission to save their world from an evil enemy, could not be more different. Hattie, gifted with wisdom and virtue, is a natural leader. Margaret, whose sword matches her spirit, is a quick-tempered warrior. Ellen is a reserved, complex, and learned prophet. Together with help from friends and allies, the sisters must determine how to stop the evil Lord Daimon and his army in order to curb the spread of blackness across the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this gripping tale for young adults, three sisters must rely on each other, friends and allies, in order to defeat evil and hopefully  usher in a new ear for their land before it is too late for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
