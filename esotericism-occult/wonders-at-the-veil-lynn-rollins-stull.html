  <title>Wonders at the Veil - Lynn Rollins Stull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to reconnect with someone you thought you had lost forever truly is a wonder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wonders at the Veil, you will discover veil work: the extraordinary spiritual practice of intentionally approaching the veil between the living and the dead to be of service to your loved ones who have died. You will learn how to penetrate the veil and forge a living connection with those you thought had traveled beyond your reach, supporting them as they journey through the spiritual realms. You will even discover ways to engage in co-creative activities with your loved ones, learning how to recognize the messages you receive from them and together bringing new creations into being on Earth that will enrich your own life and benefit all humanity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does such a thing seem impossible to you? Well, it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wonders at the Veil, Lynn Rollins Stull shares the practices she has engaged in for nearly twenty years, since the death of her daughter, Lara, in 1997. By following the instructions and suggestions in this book, you can develop your own unique veil work practice and join Lynn and others on the frontiers of spiritual exploration, at the leading edge of a new movement that seeks to serve humanity&amp;rsquo;s collective spiritual growth, creating a more loving and soul-filled world for everyone&amp;mdash;on both sides of the veil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the promise&amp;mdash;and the reality&amp;mdash;of Wonders at the Veil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now is the time in our spiritual evolution to create conscious, living relationships with loved ones who have died. I welcome you to this sacred, heart-opening work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Lynn Rollins Stull, Director, Institute for Veil Work&lt;/p&gt;" />
