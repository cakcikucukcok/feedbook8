  <title>Red - C.G Masi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Judith McKenna wants what every woman wantsa home, a family, and a husband she loves. But ever since her father disappeared ten years ago, this six-foot-three-inch redhead with a crack athletes body, an aptitude for mathematics, and an independent streak a mile wide, has not had much luck with men. But her destiny is about to change as she embarks on a sexually charged six-month journey of self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is spring break of her senior year in college, and Judith is in Miami to spend another dreary week on her stepfathers yacht when she suddenly finds herself stranded on the side of the road. As a cloud of smoke pours from the engine of  her pink Mustang convertible, she looks up from the drivers seat to see a rugged stranger dressed in black leather pants  standing next to her as his motorcycle helmet dangles from  one hand. Doc, who nicknames Judith Red, has come to her  rescue, but she is determined not to let anything or anyone  stop her search for her biological father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she slowly uncovers the mystery of her fathers disappearance, Doc introduces her to adventures that will ultimately lead her to finally discovering what she truly desires.&lt;/p&gt;" />
