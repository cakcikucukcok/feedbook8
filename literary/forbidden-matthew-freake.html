  <title>Forbidden - Matthew Freake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The only man I ever loved is dead. This is our story...&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s the summer of 1957 and Nathan is ready to get away from home to start working for his future. And what better way than to join the rail yard in Lakefield, Ontario? Hoping for some new experiences and a change of scenery, Nathan gets more than he bargains for. His cabin mate and co-worker, Alex, is helpful in showing Nathan around, but there&amp;#39;s something unique about him that keeps Nathan captivated. Stolen glances and close encounters soon lead to unfamiliar feelings between the two of them. But as they sort out their emotions, Nathan must confront painful scars that resurface from the past. Forbidden is an insightful tale of true love found and of ultimate tragedy. It explores the complexity of life&amp;#39;s obstacles for two young men discovering not only themselves, but each other, in a time where anything out of the ordinary is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;" />
