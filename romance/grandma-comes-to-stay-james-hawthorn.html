  <title>Grandma Comes to Stay - James Hawthorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Dave and Beth continue to explore the boundaries of their foray into incest as Matt and Alice seek out further adventures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I put the suitcases on the bed and closed the windows I&amp;#39;d opened to get some fresh air in the room. My mom sat on the bed and sighed. &amp;quot;I love your dad, you know that, dont you? But. . . Sometimes, I feel that he&amp;#39;s just not interested in me anymore. I mean, I wasn&amp;#39;t enamoured with turning 60 either, but suddenly, I feel that your dad just doesn&amp;#39;t have eyes for me anymore . . &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was this the moment my mom was feeding me a line? Right before dinner was about to be served? . .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sat on the bed next to my mother and looked into her eyes. &amp;#39;Mom, dad loves you, but, he&amp;#39;s always been a boob man. Maybe you need to make a move on him&amp;#39; my mother laid back on the bed &amp;quot;oh, and how in the hell would I do that at my age?&amp;quot; I stood up and headed back towards the door, &amp;#39;mom, c&amp;#39;mon, dinners gonna be ready soon&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I walked into the dining room with my mother a couple of steps behind. My dad was seated between my daughter and my wife. He was the happiest I&amp;#39;d seen him in years. Matt looked up at us, &amp;quot;you were gone a while &amp;quot; I sat down next to him &amp;#39;just helping your grandma unpack&amp;#39; he winked at me, I don&amp;#39;t think my mother saw, but she had a shy smile on her face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dinner was delicious. Alice and her grandmother loaded up the dishwasher. My dad asked if he could go and see the attic room and have a rest before the evening got drinker. Beth took him up stairs and I heard them having the same conversation my mother and I had &amp;quot;why had it taken so long to invite us&amp;quot; &amp;quot;oh you know, the kids&amp;quot; . . Etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sat back into the sofa and my mother cuddled into me. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been so long, Dave. I just want to be touched&amp;quot; I shifted uneasily, I mean sure, I wanted this, but I never thought it would happen. &amp;#39;Mom, you&amp;#39;re beautiful and dad wants you, you&amp;#39;ve just gotta say what you want&amp;#39; my mom sighed and nuzzled her head into my chest.&lt;br /&gt;
