  <title>The New Nationalism--How The Next Great American Debate Will Restore Our Country By Recasting Our Politics - Harlan M.C. Field</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Harlan Field boldly asks modern Americans to leave behind their old politics which have placed America&amp;#39;s greatness in jeopardy and exhorts us to pursue a new political strategy that will assure America&amp;#39;s great tradition for its future generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As we enter a new millennium,&amp;quot; Harlan observes, &amp;quot;we stand poised to discard the crowning achievement of the last thousand years&amp;ndash;the modern Nation-State. The only known entity that is capable of preserving Freedom and opportunity for the individual, justice for the masses, a healthy environment, a stable society and a vibrant economy is falling victim to the seemingly invincible juggernaut of Globalism. The five cardinal prerogatives of a free people are all being surrendered with little debate and even less thought. The rights of a sovereign people to formulate their own independent foreign policy, to raise and command a national army, to admit or exclude aliens, to levy tariffs on goods of foreign manufacture, and to coin their own money are under attack all over the world through such peculiar pretenders to legitimacy as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the European Union (E.U.). W e no longer can even remember what makes a group of people into a nation: A common culture, a common heritage, a common language, shared goals, shared sacrifice, shared progress.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is a must read for our politicians on the left and on the right, lest, because of party politics, America is made to give into a secondary role on the world stage of ruthless politics and demagoguery." />
