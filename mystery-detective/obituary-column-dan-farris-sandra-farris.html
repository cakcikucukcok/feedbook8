  <title>Obituary Column - Dan Farris, Sandra Farris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tracy Chapman owns and manages an antique shop, but her true passion is locating missing families of the deceased. Mystery and murder surrounds her latest assignment from the coroner&#39;s office: the death of a ninety-six year-old Jewish gentleman, Samuel Levine. But his death poses more difficulties than just locating his family. What secrets did Samuel keep that led to murder and kidnapping?&lt;p&gt;
What did Samuel own that was so valuable someone was willing to kill to obtain it? Did Samuel still have family in Germany, or would Tracy locate them in America? Tracy hopes all answers will be revealed in the journal she finds hidden in a secret drawer in Samuel&#39;s desk. When Tracy involves her friend, private investigator T. Nicholas Greger, she inadvertently puts his life at risk along with her own in Obituary Column." />
