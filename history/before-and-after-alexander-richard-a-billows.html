  <title>Before and After Alexander - Richard A. Billows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In  the arc of western history, Ancient Greece is at the apex, owing to its  grandeur, its culture, and an intellectual renaissance to rival that of Europe.  So important is Greece to history that figures such as Plato and Socrates are  still household names, and the works of Homer are regularly adapted into  movies. The most acclaimed hero of all, though, is Alexander the Great.While historians have studied Alexander&#39;s achievements at length, author and professor  Richard A. Billows delves deeper into the obscure periods of Alexander&#39;s life  before and after his reign. In the definitive Before and After  Alexander, Billows explores the years preceding Alexander, who, Billows argues, without  the foundation laid by his father, Philip II of Macedon. would not have had the  resources or influence to develop one of the greatest empires in history. Alexander was groomed from a young age to succeed his father, and by the time Philip was assassinated in 336 BC, his great empire was already well underway.The  years following Alexander&#39;s death were even more momentous. In this ambitious new work, Richard Billows robustly challenges the notion that the political strife that followed was for lack of a leader as competent as Alexander, pointing out instead that there were too many extremely capable leaders who exploited the power vacuum created by Alexander&#39;s death to carve out kingdoms for themselves.Above all, in Before and After Alexander, Billows eloquently and convincingly posits a complex view of one of the greatest empires in history, framing it not as the achievement of one man, but the culmination of several generations of aggressive expansion toward a unified purpose.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
