  <title>Angel of Bataan - Walter Macdougall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_dx_frag_StartFragment&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alice Zwicker was the only service woman from Maine to be a prisoner of the enemy in either of the two World Wars. But there is more to the story than that. Across the nation, wherever one of the seventy-seven Angels of Bataan returned home, there was a hero&amp;rsquo;s welcome. Those Army and Navy nurses had shown what American women could do and be, even in times of defeat. This is Alice&amp;rsquo;s story: her growing up in a small Maine town, her commitment to the profession of nursing, and her immersion in World War II. There was Manila, Bataan, Corregidor, and then three long, hungry years when she was held prisoner by the Japanese. For Alice, the terrible legacy of war did not end with her liberation from internment camp, or even with her coming home. When victory finally arrived for Alice, it was achieved in her own soul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
