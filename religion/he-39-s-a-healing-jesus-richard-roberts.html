  <title>He&#39;s a Healing Jesus - Richard Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why You Need to Read...&lt;br&gt;HE&amp;#39;S A HEALING JESUS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&amp;#39;re sick and in need of healing, it&amp;#39;s very important that you know how much God loves you...how much He truly wants to see you healed and made whole in every area of your life. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve written He&amp;#39;s A Healing Jesus. Many people feel isolated in their illness. They feel separated from God. They wonder if He knows about the situation they&amp;#39;re facing, and if He could possibly care about what they&amp;#39;re going through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The simple and wonderful answer to that question is &amp;quot;Yes, He knows, and yes, He cares&amp;quot;...I want you to know that. And when you understand what God reveals about Himself in His own Word, the Bible&amp;mdash;which I&amp;#39;ll teach you about in this book&amp;mdash;you&amp;#39;ll see that He also has the desire and the power to do something about it...to set you free and make you whole again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jesus walked this earth more than 2,000 years ago, He never turned away anyone who came to Him for healing...and you can be assured He won&amp;#39;t turn you away, either. He is a Healing Jesus...and I believe He wants to heal you." />
