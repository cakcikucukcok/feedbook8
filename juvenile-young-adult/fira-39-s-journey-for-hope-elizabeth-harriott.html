  <title>Fira&#39;s Journey for Hope - Elizabeth Harriott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I told Astrid to get out of the water. She wasn&#39;t there. I dove into the river. Something grabbed my feet and dragged me down. I kicked and fought till I was too tired to move. As it dragged me down, everything got darker and darker. We were probably at the bottom of the lake. I looked around hoping that someone could save me, but hope didn&#39;t do anything I had to fight. Using my new found strength I kicked the creature. It let out an ear splitting shriek, and dragged its long claws against my legs, piercing my skin, and turning the water a deep scarlet. I screamed but that was a mistake. Water flowed into my lungs. It felt like my insides were on fire. I tried to clamp my mouth shut but it was too late. Everything went black." />
