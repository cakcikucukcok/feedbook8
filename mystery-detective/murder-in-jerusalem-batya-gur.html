  <title>Murder in Jerusalem - Batya Gur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sixth and final novel from beloved and critically-acclaimed Israeli crime novelist Batya Gur&amp;#8212;a stunning tale of a beautiful and secretive woman&amp;#8217;s murder, set against the politically charged backdrop of the Israeli media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acclaimed Israeli director Benny Meyuhas&amp;#8217; film production of the heartbreaking work &amp;#8220;Iddo and Eynam&amp;#8221; promises to be a landmark of Israeli film&amp;#8212;until his wife and the films&amp;#8217; set designer Tirzah Rubin is crushed under a set piece, stalling the production indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But more shocking is what comes to light in the investigation&amp;#8212;that Tirzah&amp;#8217;s storybook life wasn&amp;#8217;t at all what it seemed, and that her death may have been part of a larger network of social and political unrest. The brooding Chief Superintendent Michael Ohayon has spent his career surrounded by horrific crimes, but perhaps none most deeply disturbs him than Tirzah&amp;#8217;s murder, its strange connection to Israeli labor disputes and religious corruption shaking him to the core. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crowning achievement to a magnificent career, this final installment in the Michael Ohayon series is a wonderful parting gift from the incomparable Batya Gur&amp;#8212;one last fascinating visit to an always tumtultous land, in the company of a detective the author and her devoted readers have loved so well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
