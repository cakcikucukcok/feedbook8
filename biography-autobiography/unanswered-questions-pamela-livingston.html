      <meta name="description" content="&lt;img src=&quot;/images/authors/author-book-desc-84027.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My grandson and I&quot;/&gt;        
&lt;P&gt;An empire demolished, a family destroyed, from the memories of one of five siblings. She was eleven before she even remembers knowing whom her grandparents were. It took until her adulthood before she realized their wealth and power in the community. The very people who swore to serve and protect turned a blind eye to her and her sublimes when they needed them most. Was this because of the money that her grandparents had or where they stood in the community? As a child, she watched her family slowly being destroyed and her grandparents empire brought down. One man could and would control her even past adulthood. To this day she still does not know how she could love someone and be afraid of that person at the same.. Her Mother searched her whole live for love but found only men who wanted her parents money and someone to take care of them. Alcohol took her from her children and left them dependent on the one person she feared most. Leaving her Mother on Christmas Eve and being taken to the lover of her Mothers husband. That woman soon became the Mother she did not have to be. Teaching her all the things that her mother never had time to. Losing that woman thirty-five years almost to the day I she met her, would prove very hard to overcome. Finding out in her late forties of an uncle who was her birth fathers twin and an aunt she had never known about. 
Though she has never married she borne two children now in their early thirties. The oldest one broke her heart with the abuse of his daughter and the eventual adoption of her. The cycle of abuse and adoption had gone full circle. Her mother was adopted and now her granddaughter.  She has drawn many simple pictures of every home she remembers starting at age four. She recalls every town or city that she lived in and some of the people who made a mark on my life. 
As you can expect, not everyone is pleased about this book being published. Some family members who were not present for many years feel that this story should remain untold. This was an undertaking that started while she was in grade eight, and she believes there was a reason she started it way back then.. This is something she did for her. She hopes that in her telling her story that she can help others. Anyone that has experienced abuse in the past should seek help in dealing with the feelings that remain. As well, anyone dealing with it now should ask for help no matter how young or old you are or how afraid you are. If they do not listen, yell louder. Stop the cycle of abuse!
