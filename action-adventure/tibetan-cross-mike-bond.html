  <title>Tibetan Cross - Mike Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An American climber in the Himalayas stumbles on a shipment of backpack nuclear
weapons headed into Tibet for use against China. Pursued by spy agencies and other killers
across Asia, North Africa, Europe and the United States, he is captured then rescued by a
beautiful young woman with whom he forms a deadly liaison. They escape, are captured and
escape again, death always at their heels. A terrifying international manhunt and stunning
love story, Tibetan Cross was a European best-seller.
CRITICAL PRAISE for TIBETAN CROSS:
.
“Intense and unforgettable.” FORT LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL
“Grips the reader from the very first chapter until the climactic ending.” UPI
“Almost impossible to put down.” I LOVE A MYSTERY
“A tautly written study of one man’s descent into living hell.” SPOKANE CHRONICLE
RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH “Murderous intensity.”
“A chilling story of escape and pursuit.” TACOMA NEWS-TRIBUNE
“An astonishing thriller.” SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER
“Grips the reader from the opening chapter and never lets go.” MIAMI HERALD
AUTHOR NOTE:
My books are based largely on my own experiences, often in remote, dangerous, and war-torn situations. I try to place readers in the midst of these experiences, so they can feel the truth of them and integrate them into their own memories and their own understanding of the joys, perils, and mysteries of life." />
