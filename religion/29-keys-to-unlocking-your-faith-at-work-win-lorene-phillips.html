  <title>29 Keys to Unlocking Your Faith at Work &amp; Win! - Lorene Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Somewhere along the journey of my walk with Christ I was made to believe that the work we do for the Lord within the four walls of the church, i.e. any church ministry activity, was most important and pleasing to God. This teaching did not sit well with me.  As I spent more time in the Word and grew in my personal relationship with the Lord I became more and more aware that God wants ALL of my life  to be a living sacrifice  a life that is fully surrendered to Him and not just  that part of my life that I offer within my church.  
Coming to this realization was a journey of self-acceptance, confidence and authenticity, understanding who I am created to be in Him.  I accepted fully that God had a specific plan for my life and that I must be true to the calling He has for me.  So, instead of just focusing on participating or even leading church related activities, I started to become more mindful of how I lived my life on a daily basis in my workplace to make sure that I give glory to God in all that I do, say or think.  I started to look for opportunities to show and share Christ in my marketplace whenever I could.  
I love to mentor and coach others and believe that my everyday life in the workplace is where I can be an active and living ambassador for Christ.  It is clear that God desires for me to be to be the salt and light in the world  the marketplace that he has suited me for both in terms of skills and fit.
The calling on our lives is awesome and much bigger than we can imagine.  Through this book I want to encourage others to consider and change their lives allowing God complete access to their work life knowing that he cares about us in that sphere and requires us to be his witness as we accomplish our jobs.  This book will specifically encourage women and anyone (men, also) who desires to increase their impact and demonstrate their faith in a practical way in the workplace. 
 I share transparently with others how I walk this called out life in the workplace in the most practical ways and provide them with an opportunity to consider ways in which they could become more effective for Christ in the workplace to which God has called them to operate." />
