      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 
Someone administered an overdose of pure heroin to a Congressman&#39;s teenage son and daughter, Helen and James.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their tragic deaths activated a huge interstate manhunt to find their killer, stimulated forcibly by the White House and intimidated by the Media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Chief of Police and the New York Mayor decided that two Homicide detectives be assigned to work alongside two of the top Special Agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Special Agents Ashley Reed and Max Cutter started their hazardous journey and vigilant surveillance to uncover an opulent International Narcotic Organization of drug Traffickers, dealers and street pushers. All masterminded by the Sicilian Mafia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their base of operations stems from an &quot;Out-post&quot; so named by the D.E.A. To a few of the police Precincts in and around the Big Apple who were unable to combat the increasing drug related crimes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A transmission of accumulated and potent psychedelic synthetic drugs and others commonly used are included for educational purposes, as are the psychedelic experiences of some of the victims that suffer macabre hallucinations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Included in this thrilling action packed and humorous novel, are some Explicit Sexy Sections, (substantially in Chapter 18).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, a very passionate entwined romantic love between Ashley and Laura, whose separation strikes heavily in both their hearts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ADULTS ONLY.
