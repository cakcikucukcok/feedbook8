  <title>Bridge Innovation - Bhola Shankar Pandey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Construction of Bridge is one of the most difficult sciences in civil engineering field. This book illustrates a case study of Chenab Bridge which was unsuccessful for 26 years because of both technical and administrative reasons. The author - who was an engineer for this project - with help of team, adopted innovative approach to eliminate the root cause of the failures. The author identified that inappropriate structural design and lack of planning was the main cause of the failure. The author changed planning and design philosophy of the bridge by selecting continuous cantilever structure where larger span of 160 meter was adopted to avoid any structural execution in the water or main stream of the river. This book deep dives and illustrates the how / engineering part of the change methodology from both technical and planning perspective.
This book can add immense insights/value to Civil Engineers, Bridge project planners and designers, Construction decision makers and students of Bridge innovation techniques." />
