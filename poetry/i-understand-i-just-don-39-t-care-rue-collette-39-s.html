  <title>I Understand, I Just Don&#39;t Care. - Rue Collette&#39;s</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you&#39;re looking for flights of eroticism and love, read Pablo Neruda.  If you&#39;re looking to explore mysticism and the spiritual realm, read Kahlil Gibran.  However, if you&#39;re ready to have both feet on the ground and you want to read about something real, congratulations, you&#39;ve just discovered Rue Collette. With mid-western perspective and a soul straight from the heartland, Rue speaks to our very own experiences by relating her own.  Will you laugh, will you cry, will you feel gut wrenching emotion?  You already have and Collette&#39;s work will remind you of those moments while lending comfort and understanding that you&#39;re not alone, we&#39;ve all been there. Transforming a lifetime of intimate thoughts, diaries and journal entries into a book of poems that tells it like it is, &quot;I Understand, I Just Don&#39;t Care&quot; is a gift to those of us ready to connect, with ourselves, and with those real-world relationships around us." />
