  <title>Nudity is for the Birds - Kethandra Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the third year, red-headed virgin Robin poses her riddle to the naked masses at the local Nude Day celebration, hoping to find her intellectual needle in a Midwestern haystack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Jay&amp;#39;s knowledge of birds and riddling win the day and Robin&amp;#39;s heart? This sexy, sweet, and charming story of first-time love is sure to delight as they discover their shared love of birds, words, and each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That left Jay alone, thoughtful and nearly petrified with fear. At least he tried to remain thoughtful, while alternating images popped in and out of his mind&amp;#39;s eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perfect freckled cleavage framed in lace. Root beer-soaked fried mushrooms. Freckles. Mushrooms. Cleavage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was truly gorgeous. Not beauty contest, make-up and hairdo gorgeous. Natural, towel-dry-and-ready-to-go stunning radiance, especially with her hair shining even more resplendently in the recently-appearing sun&amp;#39;s rays. That wonderful smile always near the surface.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And her body! He couldn&amp;#39;t see freckles from here, but he could sure see everything else. A belly that swelled that slightest just enough to lead the eye down to a short, shapely triangle of orange-red hair peaking out between her legs. Her legs were decidedly curvier and softer than the tall, slim girl next to her. Creamy smooth legs that would be heaven wrapped around your hips or sliding softly over cheeks as your nose and mouth nuzzled closer to their moistening zenith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jay rarely considered himself a poet, but Red brought out his inner sonneteer. His eyes continued their journey the length of her legs, stopped at her shoes. Boat shoes, kind of preppy, in a bright blue. A blue that went well with her red hair and blue eyes, but an odd choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Think, Jaybird, think! You&amp;#39;re different from these clods, these bumpkins that have been universally wrong. You&amp;#39;re brilliant in school, you know calculus and organic chemistry like few your age, you have personally seen and identified over 207 species of birds. Why would you be intimidated by a simple pair of bare boobies?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An image came to Jay then of Boobies, the pelagic birds similar to the Albatross, bobbing their heads in their unique, comical mating dance. Nature shows on TV loved to score the motion with upbeat Jazz. Red wanted to do her own mating dance, or she wouldn&amp;#39;t be here, naked, having strange men lineup to try and solve her riddle. While wearing those odd blue shoes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What was her mating dance? &lt;i&gt;Don&amp;#39;t step on my blue boat shoes?&lt;/i&gt;" />
