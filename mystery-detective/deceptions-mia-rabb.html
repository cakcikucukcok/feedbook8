  <title>Deceptions - Mia  Rabb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Cass, a brilliant and cocky young lawyer and pilot for the navy thought he was immune to injustice. He strived for the truth and fairness for all of his clients, except one. Cass locks horns with Anton Balistrano, mob boss, billionaire, ruthless and cunning, a man who stops at nothing to get what he wants. Anton shrewdly befriends Rear Admiral AJ Zueleger, both men in position of power, both men fighting over the man they want in their organization. Francesca, AJ?s daughter falls in love with Anton the first time she sees him. Will he use that power over AJ to get Cass to join the mob? Can AJ keep Cass safe and away from the glamorous life Anton promises him or will Anton?s deceptions turn Cass against the truth and justice he?s known his whole life?" />
