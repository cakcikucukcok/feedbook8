  <title>House of Many Ways - Diana Wynne Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charmain Baker is in over her head. Looking after Great-Uncle William&#39;s tiny cottage while he&#39;s ill should have been easy. But Great-Uncle William is better known as the Royal Wizard Norland, and his house bends space and time. Its single door leads to any number of places&amp;#8212;the bedrooms, the kitchen, the caves under the mountains, the past, and the Royal Mansion, to name just a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By opening that door, Charmain has become responsible for not only the house, but for an extremely magical stray dog, a muddled young apprentice wizard, and a box of the king&#39;s most treasured documents. She has encountered a terrifying beast called a lubbock, irritated a clan of small blue creatures, and wound up smack in the middle of an urgent search. The king and his daughter are desperate to find the lost, fabled Elfgift&amp;#8212;so desperate that they&#39;ve even called in an intimidating sorceress named Sophie to help. And where Sophie is, can the Wizard Howl and fire demon Calcifer be far behind? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with that magical family involved, there&#39;s bound to be chaos&amp;#8212;and unexpected revelations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one will be more surprised than Charmain by what Howl and Sophie discover. &lt;/p&gt;" />
