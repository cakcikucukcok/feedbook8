  <title>No Sweat - Bill Lindquist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Earths attempt to repel an alien invasion during the first Troglin war. The setting is in the not-too-distant future, and it is told through the eyes of the men at the tactical end of the war, up close and personal. Our heroes, Brad and Troy, are two fighter pilots that are pulled into an onslaught of adventures ranging from barroom brawls and car chases to romance and wild dogfights miles above the earth. Along the way there are heartaches, heartbreaks, laughs, defeats, and victories. In short they get shot at, shot up, and shot down.
The Troglins are merciless slave-trading invaders. They are harsh humanoids and are shown through the eyes of one of their flotilla leaders, Agrat Acmea. Escorting swarms of suppressor and annihilator saturation craft, he surprisingly finds himself in difficulties as the feisty earthlings prove to be tougher than expected. In typical Troglin fashion, someone has to take the blame for the greater than expected losses and Agrat finds himself in political hot water.
No sweat is a unique book that brings the rare combination of action packed futuristic adventure, blended with romance, passion, and a surprising ending." />
