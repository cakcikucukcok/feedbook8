  <title>Jane Davies - Douglas Nordfors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When he is introduced to Jeremy Davies at a party in the summer of 2000, Edward Larson has no idea what lies in store for him: a tentative but ever-deepening friendship with Jeremys sister; a perilous fascination with Jeremys wife; an obsession with the London Blitz, linking him to the Davies family and to the world at large in mysterious ways; an ability to assess his own troubled adulthood; and two trips from Long Island to London, each enlightening in its own way. 
At once a novel of ideas and a suspenseful drama, Jane Davies examines through multiple and interlocking angles the difficult art of being human.
