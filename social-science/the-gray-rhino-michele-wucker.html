  <title>The Gray Rhino - Michele Wucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The #1 English-language bestseller in China--the book that is shaping China&#39;s planning and policy for the future.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &quot;gray rhino&quot; is a highly probable, high impact yet neglected threat:  kin to both the elephant in the room and the improbable and  unforeseeable black swan. Gray rhinos are not random surprises, but  occur after a series of warnings and visible evidence. The bursting of  the housing bubble in 2008, the devastating aftermath of Hurricane  Katrina and other natural disasters, the new digital technologies that  upended the media world, the fall of the Soviet Union...all were evident  well in advance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do leaders and decision makers keep failing to  address obvious dangers before they spiral out of control? Drawing on  her extensive background in policy formation and crisis management, as  well as in-depth interviews with leaders from around the world, Michele  Wucker shows in &lt;i&gt;The Gray Rhino&lt;/i&gt; how to recognize and strategically  counter looming high impact threats. Filled with persuasive stories,  real-world examples, and practical advice, &lt;i&gt;The Gray Rhino&lt;/i&gt; is  essential reading for managers, investors, planners, policy makers, and  anyone who wants to understand how to profit by avoiding getting  trampled.&lt;/p&gt;" />
