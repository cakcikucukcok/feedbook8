  <title>Phantom Angel - David Handler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wickedly funny private eye novel set in the dark underbelly of New York City, where the worlds of Broadway and organized crime meet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When it comes to tracking down teen runaways, there is no private investigator in New York City better than streetwise Benji Golden. But his newest client is Morrie Frankel, the last of the great Broadway showmen. Morrie&#39;s current extravaganza, a lavish $65 million musical adaptation of Emily Bronte&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Wuthering Heights,&lt;/i&gt; is the biggest unfolding disaster the Great White Way has ever seen. Rumor has it, if he doesn&#39;t find a deep-pocketed &quot;angel,&quot; or investor, soon, he might go down and take the production with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrie thought he had found such an investor in hedge fund billionaire R.J. Farnell, who promised to keep the teetering production afloat. But Farnell and his $12 million have vanished. Benji tracks Farnell to his girlfriend, Jonquil Beausoleil, who turns the investigation on its head. When Morrie is found gunned down on 42nd Street, Benji finds himself smack in the middle of a high-profile murder investigation, and he&#39;ll have to pierce through a lot of Broadway gossip before he can find the killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Phantom Angel &lt;/i&gt;is the next entertaining installment in David Handler&#39;s newest mystery series, sure to delight both old and new fans of this award--winning, unique voice in crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
