      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The thirteen short stories of this book&amp;mdash;10 fiction and three non-fiction&amp;mdash;put faces to the unsung heroes who leave their homelands in Latin America seeking a better life in the US.

    	<p>The thirteen short stories of this book—10 fiction and three non-fiction—put faces to the unsung heroes who leave their homelands in Latin America seeking a better life in the US. Some provide a glimpse of the evils in their countries of origin that prompted their migration--dire poverty, crimes with total disregard from human life, endemic rampant corruption, no rules of law, no freedom. In the story <em>Uprooted Agave</em>, to protest his meager salary, a peasant stood before the cacique in the presence “of the large portrait of a president of Mexico, whose eyes basked in immortal greatness, the greatness of the office the public had granted him and the dignitary had forgotten the source.” Others describe the dangers of crossing the southern border. In <em>Daydreaming on a Greyhound Bus</em>, a gamin, a girl, her mother, and a coyote cross the deceitfully calm Rio Grande into El Paso, Texas, when the girl falls. “The boy releases himself, jumps into the water, clasps the girl against his body, and pulls her up. A maelstrom circles them, the vacuum sucking them into the depth.” Some stories recount the immigrants’ daily hard work and tenacity to achieve the American dream in spite of their lack of schooling, foreign language, and different culture. <em>The Mayan Fighter</em> describes this determination: “I cleaned empty cans of paint in a tank with 350 gallons of solvent. The intense odor caused headaches, nausea, and dry heaving. Two or three times a day, I wobbled to the restroom where vomiting erupted with a vengeance over and over. But nothing would make me quit my work.” The immigrants’ trials and tribulations come alive throughout the book. It describes the racism of some whites because of the newcomers’ Indian features. In <em>The Rotten Yard,</em> a white supervisor tells his Mexican subordinate, “Mexicans are niggers with sombreros.”  Latinos also suffer slavery by some of their well-to-do compatriots who have imported this scourge into the US. In <em>Whispering Waters,</em> a housemaid lies in her small room in a mansion in Wilmette, Illinois, reminiscing about the day his master bought her in the Peruvian jungle: “She watched her father hold his tears back. Her blood seemed to have turned into ice, and her legs did not obey her. She kneeled down and asked him to bless her.” The book also contains accounts of dreams fulfilled, people helping people, love and hope. In <em>The Pledge</em>, love blossoms in two youngsters in the midst of dilapidated buildings, gangs, death, and misery. The real story <em>The United States Vs. Oscar Sosa</em> exemplifies the weak laws that fail to protect even legal residents:  “The officers handcuffed him, read him the Miranda warning, and took him into a car amidst his protestations. ‘What have I done? This is an error. Please, let me go free.’ They provided him no reason for the arrest and whisked him off across the state line into a federal prison.” The book describes the success of many immigrants and the failure of others who end up living in crime-ridden barrios in worse conditions than in their home countries. It also features deception, treason, infidelity, vengeance, hatred, bigamy, ungratefulness. LatinoStories.com has reviewed the work. “The stories in <em>Uprooted Agave </em>are haunting not just because of the way they describe the horrors of living in the US on the fringes—where dignity and livelihoods are threatened—but also because they capture the tragic realities of immigrants crossing and risking it all for their families and themselves.”</p>
