  <title>Patty ja Priscilla - Jean Webster Translated by Arne Ylermi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jean Webster (pseudonym for Alice Jane Chandler Webster, July 24, 1876 &amp;ndash; June 11, 1916) was an American writer and author of many books including Daddy-Long-Legs and Dear Enemy. Her best-known books feature lively and likeable young female protagonists who come of age intellectually, morally, and socially, but with enough humor, snappy dialogue, and gently biting social commentary to make her books palatable and enjoyable to contemporary readers.&lt;br /&gt;
Alice Jane Chandler Webster was born in Fredonia, New York. She was the eldest child of Annie Moffet Webster and Charles Luther Webster. She lived her early childhood in a strongly matriarchal and activist setting, with her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother all living under the same roof. Her great-grandmother worked on temperance issues and her grandmother on racial equality and women&amp;#39;s suffrage." />
