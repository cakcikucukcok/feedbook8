  <title>One Ordinary Woman, One Extraordinary God - M. Lorene Kimura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Encouragement for the Heart
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GOD CALLS YOUR NAME
You dream of being used by God but think your life has been too rough, you have been through too much, or done too much for yourself.  
If you want to find out if God could use you, join with Lorene Kimura to see how he used even the most unsuspecting women.  The secret is not in the knowledge you have but being ready every day for the special time for when God calls your name.  Describing herself as the chosen child, Lorene never comprehended the entire meaning of that until much later in life, when God called her and she was ready to listen.  Come on a journey, as you discover a fresh approach to a life for God, conquering the attitudes that would hold you back.  God doesnt look at your mistakes, lifestyle, or commitments, but by your willingness to say, Here I am, God. Use me.  
Jam-packed with storytelling and Bible teaching, One Ordinary Woman, One Extraordinary God will open your eyes to the many ways God can use you where you are, if only you will let him, illustrating the similarities of biblical and contemporary women.
God has made us what we are. In Christ Jesus, God made us to do good works, which God planned in advance for us to live our lives doing.
(Ephesians 2:10, NCV)" />
