  <title>THE MAGIC MIRROR - A Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 307&lt;br /&gt;
In this 307th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;ldquo;THE MAGIC MIRROR&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, there was once a wise old king in a far-off land who said to himself, &amp;quot;I have a daughter as well as a son; why should she not have a kingdom too? I will see to it at once.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He called the chief map-maker to him, and said: &amp;quot;Make a map of my kingdom and divide it by a line so evenly that each part shall be exactly half. There must not be one hair&amp;#39;s breadth more on the east of the line than on the west.&amp;quot; The chief map-maker worked hard, and soon had the map ready.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then the king made a law that when he died the Prince should rule over all the country on one side of the line, and the Princess should rule over all the country on the other side. In due course the king died and the prince and princess both started to rule over their kingdoms and that&amp;rsquo;s when the trouble started&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; What were the troubles you ask? Did they originate from a brother and sister quarrelling? If not what was causing them? How were they to be resolved as they affected all the people in both kingdoms? You&amp;#39;re invited to find out if a resolution was arrived at. To do so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the story for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
