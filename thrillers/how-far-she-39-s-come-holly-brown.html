  <title>How Far She&#39;s Come - Holly Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the highly acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Try to Find Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;This is Not Over &lt;/em&gt;comes the unforgettable, harrowing story of a young broadcast journalist who discovers a mysterious diary from a female broadcaster in 1991 featuring startling&amp;#8212;and frightening&amp;#8212;parallels to her own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might be wondering what a diary from 1991 has to do with you. You&#39;re about to find out. &lt;em&gt;Those who don&#39;t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Cheyenne Florian has just received her dream job offer. On the strength of a few vlogs, she&amp;#8217;s recruited to be the new correspondent on the recently hatched Independent News Network, INN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the slogan &amp;#8220;Because independent thinking is the only way out,&amp;#8221; INN has branded itself as innovative. Yet once Cheyenne joins the INN team, she finds age-old dynamics in play. Some of the female staff resent her meteoric rise, while a number of the men are only too happy to welcome her. Then there&amp;#8217;s the diary left for her anonymously, written in 1991 by a female broadcaster named Elyse Rohrbach. The mysterious diary is accompanied by a note, urging Cheyenne to learn from the past. She wants to believe it&amp;#8217;s intended as inspiration and friendly advice, or at most, a warning. But as disturbing&amp;#8212;and increasingly dangerous&amp;#8212;parallels begin to emerge, she starts to wonder if something more sinister is at work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s almost as if someone is engineering the similarities in Cheyenne&amp;#8217;s life to match those from Elyse&amp;#8217;s past, like she&amp;#8217;s a pawn in a very twisted game. But Cheyenne is determined to rewrite the rules and play her own game. Though they&amp;#8217;re separated by more than twenty-five years, Elyse and Cheyenne are forced to learn the same lesson: Nothing is more threatening than a woman who doesn&amp;#8217;t yet know her own power&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
