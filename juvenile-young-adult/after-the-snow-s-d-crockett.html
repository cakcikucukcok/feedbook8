  <title>After the Snow - S. D. Crockett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The oceans stopped working before Willo was born, so the world of ice and snow is all he&#39;s ever known. He lives with his family deep in the wilderness, far from the government&#39;s controlling grasp. Willo&#39;s survival skills are put to the test when he arrives home one day to find his family gone. It could be the government; it could be scavengers--all Willo knows is he has to find refuge and his family. It is a journey that will take him into the city he&#39;s always avoided, with a girl who needs his help more than he knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;S.D. Crockett on narrative voice and an especially cold winter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What was your inspiration for&lt;/i&gt; After the Snow&lt;i&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Well, apart from the unbelievably cold winter during which I was writing--in an unheated house, chopping logs and digging my car out of the snow; I think much of the inspiration for the settings in &lt;i&gt;After the Snow&lt;/i&gt; came from my various travels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my twenties I worked as a timber buyer in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia, and that work led to travels in Eastern Europe and Armenia. As soon as I step off the plane in those places it smells like home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound strange to say, when &lt;i&gt;After the Snow&lt;/i&gt; is set in Wales, but really the practical dilemmas in the book come directly from places I&#39;ve been, people I&#39;ve lived with, and the hardships I&#39;ve seen endured with grace and capability. I was in Russia not long after the Soviet Union collapsed and I&#39;ve seen society in freefall. Without realizing it at the time I think those experiences led me to dive into &lt;i&gt;After the Snow&lt;/i&gt; with real passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would western civilization look like with a few tumbles under its belt? What would happen if the things we took for granted disappeared? I wanted to write a gripping story about that scenario, but hardly felt that I was straying into fantasy in the detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you want readers to most remember about&lt;/i&gt; After the Snow&lt;i&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all have the capacity to survive, but in what manner? What do we turn to in those times of trouble? Those are the questions I would like people to contemplate after reading &lt;i&gt;After the Snow&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How did Willo&#39;s unique voice come to you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willo&#39;s voice appeared in those crucial first few paragraphs. After that it just grew along with his world and the terrible situations that arise. I think his voice is in all of us. We don&#39;t understand, we try to make good--maybe we find ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How did you stay warm while writing this novel?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;I banked up the fire--and was warmed by hopes of spring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
