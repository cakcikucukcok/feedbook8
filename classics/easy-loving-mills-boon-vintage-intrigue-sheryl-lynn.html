          &lt;strong&gt;HER PROTECTOR&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A WOMAN IN JEOPARDY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Catherine St. Clair finally had everything she&#39;d ever wanted–including the perfect fiancé. Then Easy Martel barged back into her life, telling her that her &quot;perfect&quot; fiancé was a would-be murderer. Easy spoke with conviction in his voice; he looked at her with intensity in his eyes…but was he telling the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;AND THE MAN WHO MUST PROTECT HER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seeing her again brought back all of his old feelings…old yearnings for all he&#39;d lost. Yet no matter how many times Easy went over his investigation, the facts brought him to one place–to Catherine. How could he convince her that she was the next victim…and the only place she&#39;d be safe was in the shelter of his arms?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A woman alone…with no one to trust. Where can she run? Straight into the arms of HER PROTECTOR&lt;/strong&gt;
