  <title>The Intern - Gregg Hurwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Nowhere Man is a figure shrouded in secrecy--a near legendary figure who helps the truly desperate, those with nowhere else to turn who are lucky enough to be able to reach out to him. When darkness closes in, the Nowhere Man is your last, best hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before he was the Nowhere Man, Evan Smoak was a highly trained government operative known to a few as Orphan X. But he now lives by hiding in plain sight, keeping his head down and his eyes clear. So when a local summer intern for a tabloid news site finds herself trailing an aggressive reporter into a crime zone, things go terribly awry. The only person who can help her is a man with the background and the skills of the Nowhere Man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Gregg Hurwitz comes an electrifying, original story in his &quot;nerve-shredding&quot; internationally #1 bestsellling Orphan X series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also contains an extended excerpt from the Orphan X thriller--&lt;i&gt;Out of the Dark&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
