  <title>Alpha Packed - Book 1 - Darla Dunbar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 1 of The Alpha Packed BBW Paranormal Shifter Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A BBW Paranormal Shifter Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A vampire, a werewolf and a human walk into a bar. Actually, it was more like a bookstore. Anyway, you get the gist. Suffice it to say, anytime you see this combination of the three, you can expect some angst, drama and fighting. Lots of fighting. Oh yeah, can&amp;#39;t forget the romance. There&amp;#39;s a lot of that too. Read on, my friend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Darlene discovers an inner power that can help her werewolf boyfriend, Idris, in his fight against a rival pack. How can she hope to master such power if it frightens her so?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Darlene has led a quiet life since suffering through a terrible break-up. She wants nothing more than to spend her time in front of the TV, away from any sort of trouble. But all that goes down the drain when handsome, rugged and rough Idris comes into her life. His secret? He is a werewolf on the lookout for his missing pack leader. Darlene quickly finds herself pulled towards this mysterious man and at the same time finds herself falling deeper and deeper into the world of the supernatural.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The more she falls for Idris, the more Darlene gets swept up in inter-pack conflicts, vampires with agendas and a dark plot to bring the worst of both worlds together. As Darlene gets pulled deeper down the rabbit hole, she finds out more about herself than she ever knew possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Darlene balance her regular life with the world that Idris has introduced her to? Or will she find herself overwhelmed by the dangers facing her headfirst?&lt;br /&gt;
