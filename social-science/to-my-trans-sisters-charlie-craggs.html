This invigorating anthology was written by transgendered women for transgendered women, which is a welcome departure from the established genre of texts about transgendered individuals that seek to explain their lives and experiences for a presumed audience of primarily cisgendered individuals.<br /><b><i>To My Trans Sisters by Charlie Craggs - Goodreads</i></b> | Overflowing with hard-won wisdom and compassionate insight, Charlie Craggs' To My Trans Sisters is a love letter to our community from the women who understand, better than anyone, what our world is like.
