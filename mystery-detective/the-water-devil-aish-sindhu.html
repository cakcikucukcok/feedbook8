  <title>The Water Devil - Aish Sindhu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An A. F. -320 model aircraft of America was crossing the Atlantic Ocean 18000 feet above the sea level, carrying 156 passengers. The aircraft was still flying across the  Atlantic  Ocean. Suddenly, a sort of peculiar light rays touched the aircraft. The plane shook horribly. it went out the pilot&#39;s control and darted towards an unknown destination. The horror-stricken passengers screamed  loudly. The pilot managed to contact the American Airlines Office and inform them about the strange occurrences. The news of the plane going out of control caused a general panic among the officials in the terminal. Suddenly, the line of communication between the terminal and the aircraft cut off.
Nixon screamed when he beheld that incredible sight. &quot;My God, What is it?&quot; the other passengers followed his gaze and saw the gigantic hear and  long neck of a monstrous creature that was approaching the plane. They were horrified to death. There were plenty of horns  The plane stood still in the air as if it was feathered to an unseen nail. The roof of the plane melted in the powerful rays which originated from the horns of the monster. The passengers screamed, seeing the cave sized mouth of the devilish creature aiming at them. The next moment, the monster caught some of the passengers in its mouth and swallowed them. One of the passengers gathered his guts and started firing at it. The effect was totally unanticipated. All the bullets from the revolver got caught in the fatal light rays and vanished into thin air. A middle aged man jumped out of the plane in fright. Suddenly the monster extended one of its horns and caught him. It roared horrible. The aircraft, its passengers and the sky  itself shook, hearing the blood chilling roar of the monster. The plane moved in a circle as if it was caught in a whirlpool. The monster caught the panic stricken middle aged man in its mouth. The other passengers screamed in horror, hearing his bones being crunched and ground.
Will any of them escape from that devilish monster? Who will save them? Will anyone succeed in killing the scary creature?" />
