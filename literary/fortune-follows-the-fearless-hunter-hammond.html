  <title>Fortune Follows the Fearless - Hunter Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scarred by a troubled childhood, and angry at the vicissitudes
of fate, Marshall Martin, a young New York portfolio
manager, decides to win fame and fortune by bringing down
his employer, the largest hedge fund in the world. Relying
on a fabricated insider-trading plot involving his boss, he
succeeds in his goal, only to find that his actions have a host
of unintended consequences on him and those around him.
Plagued by guilt and fear, he begins to find a degree of solace
in his idealized love for the former fiance of his best friend
at work. However, it is only when he realizes her own dark
secrets and flaws, that he is able to embark upon a true path to
redemption, and perhaps, ultimately, happiness.
Set in New York, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Monaco,
Fortune Follows The Fearless is an unflinching examination of
one mans attempt to come to terms with his own mediocrity
and mortality, in a world of money and ruthless ambition. It is
Hunter Hammonds first novel." />
