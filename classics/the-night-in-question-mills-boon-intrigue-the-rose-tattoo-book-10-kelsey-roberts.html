          &lt;strong&gt;FBI agent Matt DeMarco never thought his morning jog on the beach would draw him into a ring of cold-blooded killers. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or that one of the murder suspects would be the stunning half-conscious woman he found washed up on the beach…dressed in an evening gown and dripping blood. &quot;Trust no one&quot; was all she remembered. But as her memory of that night came back, so did an overwhelming fear and the feeling that she was in serious danger.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With nowhere else to turn, she had to trust Matt with her life. And in an unguarded moment, he seemed willing to trust her with his darkest secret. But how long could they keep their mutual lust in check?&lt;/p&gt;
