  <title>A Hundred Fires in Cuba - John Thorndike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1956, a young American photographer falls in love with a Cuban line cook at New York&amp;rsquo;s Waldorf Astoria. They have a ten-week affair which ends when Immigration arrests and deports him, and by then Clare Miller is pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Few Americans know the name Camilo Cienfuegos. All Cubans do. In real life he was the most charismatic of Fidel Castro&amp;rsquo;s commanders&amp;mdash;until his small plane vanished only months after Fidel came to power. In &lt;em&gt;A Hundred Fires in Cuba&lt;/em&gt;, Clare must choose between the stable Cuban businessman she has married and her first love, Camilo. Though a true revolutionary, Camilo likes to dance and drink. He likes women, and too many women like him. His courage is legendary, yet when he comes to visit Clare he&amp;rsquo;s afraid of his own daughter and her moods. Clare worries that he&amp;rsquo;ll never make a good parent, but she cannot resist him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
