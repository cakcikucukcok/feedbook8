  <title>Submission - Michel Houellebecq, Lorin Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A controversial, intelligent, and mordantly funny new novel from France&#39;s most famous literary figure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paris, 2022. François is bored. He&#39;s a middle-aged lecturer at the Sorbonne and an expert on J. K. Huysmans, the famous nineteenth-century &quot;decadent&quot; author. But François&#39;s own decadence is considerably smaller in scale. He sleeps with his students, eats microwave dinners, reads the classics, queues up YouPorn.&lt;br&gt;    Meanwhile, it&#39;s election season. And although Francois feels &quot;about as politicized as a hand towel,&quot; things are getting pretty interesting. In an alliance with the socialists, France&#39;s new Islamic party sweeps to power. Islamic law comes into force. Women are veiled, polygamy is encouraged, and Francois is offered an irresistible academic advancement--on condition that he convert to Islam. &lt;br&gt;    Adam Gopnik in &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; has said of this novel that &quot;Houellebecq is not merely a satirist but--more unusually--a &lt;i&gt;sincere&lt;/i&gt; satirist, genuinely saddened by the absurdities of history and the madnesses of mankind.&quot; Michel Houellebecq&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Submission&lt;/i&gt; may be satirical and melancholic, but it is also hilarious; a comic masterpiece by one of France&#39;s great novelists.&lt;/p&gt;" />
