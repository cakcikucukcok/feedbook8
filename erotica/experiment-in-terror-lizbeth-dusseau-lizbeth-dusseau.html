  <title>Experiment In Terror -  Lizbeth Dusseau, Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rachel Linney&#39;s college reunion is a real drag - until she unwittingly stumbles on the guest of honor, a high-powered Hollywood attorney Jackson Brandt who develops an instant fascination for the lovely college professor. A little investigation into her life reveals that Rachel writes nasty sadomasochistic sex books under the penname Marilyn Hayworth. When Jackson surprises her with his discovery, she&#39;s furious that he would dare pry into her life. But then he makes a startling offer; proposing to make her kinky fantasies come to life. Rachel is so captivated by this mesmerizing dominant, that she finds herself swept into his S&amp;M world. Jackson delights in snatching Rachel from her modest life, dressing her like a whore and thrusting her into sexual situations, where she experiences the bondage, punishment and humiliation she writes about in graphic detail. She&#39;s whipped in an infamous NYC sex club, gangbanged by three black men, and subjected to humiliating public exposure. Jackson is a powerful force, often cruel and inaccessible. His continued probing into her life makes her uneasy. Yet at times he&#39;s intensely affectionate, and the raw eroticism of her own desires make her defenseless in his presence. Rachel doesn&#39;t know whether to love him or swear him off. While embroiled in the tempestuous affair with Jackson, Rachel&#39;s former lover starts harassing her. Desperately needing money, the volatile and erratic Kyle threatens to expose damning secrets from her past unless she does what he orders. But he soon reveals that he has far more in mind for his former girlfriend than simple extortion. Rachel is now unwittingly caught between two ruthless men, vulnerable to their dangerous schemes, and terrified of their powerful hold over her." />
