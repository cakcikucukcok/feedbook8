  <title>The Beatification of Shirley - Wayne Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Beatification of Shirley chronicles the Whitford family&#39;s journey through decades of miscalculations and misguided intentions. At a time of society&#39;s access to an expanding base of knowledge,Conrad Whitford will completely reject any new information and be very wary of anyone who embraces new ideas. Lorraine,his wife,will blindly second his every opinion because The Bible tells her to do so. Their children will have to navigate their way through a minefield of Biblical inperatives about which there can be no discussion.  The oldest,Norman,will struggle to survive in a world stacked against him. He is gay. The second son,Randy,will conform as best he can to a value system he doesn&#39;t want to second guess,but will fall short. The oldest daughter, Shirley,will be the weakest link in the fabric of the family,and an unfortunate victim of her parent&#39;s overprotection. She will be elevated to the status of a Saint. The youngest,and adopted,Beverly,will not subscribe to anything without questioning,causing her parents unexpected grief. The family,and everyone who comes in contact with them,will plunge deeper into turmoil as Conrad&#39;s ever-growing distrust of anyone who may think they know more then he does, and an unrelenting reliance on strictly literal interpretatiion of His Bible,will sweep the unsuspecting passengers toward an impending train wreck. There will be many casualties. All will be atributed,by Conrad,Lorraine and Shirley,to Devine Intervention,keeping them in a house that Shirley is convinced is her birthright,but might just eat people for lunch." />
