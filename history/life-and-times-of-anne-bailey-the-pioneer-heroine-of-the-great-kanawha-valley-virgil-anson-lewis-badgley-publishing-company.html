  <title>Life and Times of Anne Bailey - The Pioneer Heroine of the Great Kanawha Valley - Virgil Anson Lewis, Badgley Publishing Company</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the moment she heard news of her husband&#39;s death at the Battle of Point Pleasant, a strange, wild dream seemed to possess her and she became determined to avenge his death. Clad in buckskin pants, a petticoat, brogan shoes, a man&#39;s coat and hat, a belt about her waist which held a knife and a tomahawk, she shouldered a rifle and took up the life of a frontiersman and a messenger carrying dispatches between Fort Lee at present day Charleston, WV, Fort Savannah at present day Lewisburg, and Fort Randolph at present day Point Pleasant, WV.  
    In 1791, large bodies of Indians were discovered hovering near Fort Lee. The powder supply was perilously low. It was one hundred miles to Fort Savannah, the only place for re-supply. The commander asked for volunteers to go and bring back powder. No man was willing to put their lives in jeopardy, but Mad Anne Bailey, without hesitation, shouted, &quot;I will go!&quot;" />
