  <title>Windows and Holidays - Ejike Igboanugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows and Holidays&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poetry that resonates with a young persons expectations of a world which unfolds disquietingly. This is a collection of dreamsthe dreams of a young man about his immediate surroundings. Conflicts here and there are poet Ejike Igboanugos major concerns, and his poetry gives him the voice to express those concerns. He considers the future, contemplates the religious, addresses nature, and raises questions regarding society in his poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very heart of &lt;i&gt;Windows and Holidays&lt;/i&gt; lies a message of selflessness, and this collection conveys that its important for us to get along and strive for understanding, hope, and peace. Our hearts and our society need this desperately; we must be reminded from time to time that work is love and love gathers all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of all the things I believe in, I believe in tomorrow the most.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the things to come because today will soon be gone,&lt;br&gt;
and yesterday is not coming back.&lt;br&gt;
Although rich memories gladden the heart,&lt;br&gt;
I believe tomorrow holds more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow being what it is, a whole lot to comprehend,&lt;br&gt;
is far greater than can be put down in ink, even by the poet.&lt;br&gt;
Tomorrow is like a recurring beginning of creation:&lt;br&gt;
a chance to grow up every time;&lt;br&gt;
to make amends; to repay debt;&lt;br&gt;
to take on a challenge; and to overcome.&lt;br&gt;
Though memory keeps experiences like forever,&lt;br&gt;
I believe tomorrow holds so much more ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
