      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1941, London. Sirens warn of danger as German bomber planes approach the city. Ever cautious, Kathy and her mother head immediately for the nearest public air raid shelter but are separated in the desperate scramble to safety. When the building is destroyed in a direct hit, it is a miracle Kathy survives, and before the night is through, she will suffer further loss as her home is reduced to rubble. Finding herself alone amid the chaos and ruins, Kathy is left with nothing but a burning fury towards those she holds responsible for her devastating loss and a determination to join the war effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigned as a secretary to the enigmatic Commander Evans, Kathy throws herself into war work, gaining a reputation for her efficiency and thoroughness. But the commander has frequent unexplained absences, and Kathy longs to discover the secrets of his intelligence missions. Before the war is through, she will come face-to-face with the enemy, and will discover that the men behind the machines are perhaps not quite the monsters she was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
