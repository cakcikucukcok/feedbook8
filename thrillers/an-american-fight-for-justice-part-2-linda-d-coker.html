  <title>An American Fight for Justice Part 2 - Linda D. Coker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As introduced in the original novel A Daughter&#39;s Duty: God, Country, Family, Belinda Star is a highly-decorated veteran of the United States Army. Her military background has created a woman adept in the art of battle, but even her specialized training and battlefield experiences could not prepare her to deal with the crimes committed by her own family. In this continuation of Belinda&#39;s story, the reader realizes just how far the criminal activity of Belinda&#39;s family will go. As Belinda quickly discovers, her family will go to great lengths to deceive and manipulate one of their own for personal gain. The novel begins with Belinda again in Germany, where she lives with her active duty husband, but soon we witness Belinda making repeated journeys back to the United States, attempting to recover family heirlooms and ancestral artifacts that are now being held hostage by her own family. While Belinda&#39;s original story poised her against her mother, who was a perpetrator of the crimes, this continuation now sees the sentencing and release of her mother. Jane King now realizes the error of her ways and unites with her strongest daughter in an attempt to seek justice and avenge the crimes of their family. While Belinda is no longer alone in her battle this time around-she now has her mother by her side-she quickly realizes that the American legal system is fractured. When repeated attempts at remedying her legal battles prove fruitless, Belinda reaches a dark and empty place where she no longer can believe in the justice she once held sacred. As she reaches her lowest point, only an act of terrorism can awaken her to the true catastrophes present in the world. As the United States wages war in a far away land, those battles strike a chord with Belinda, as her husband must leave the safety of their new home in Colorado and begin to serve his country far away from the safety that Belinda can provide him." />
