  <title>What I Really Learned in College - Addison Winters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alex Rose is a 32-year-old divorced mother of two, looking for a better life for her and her sons. In search of answers, she returns to college to finally get that degree she&amp;rsquo;s always dreamed of. What she finds is something she wasn&amp;rsquo;t even looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason Brooks is every girl&amp;#39;s dream: 21 years old, tall, with dirty blond hair that curls when it&amp;rsquo;s wet, sea-blue eyes, and dimples. Hot, sexy...and deliciously na&amp;iuml;ve and innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter a tantalizing world where an average soccer mom utilizes her newfound knowledge of psychology to make life just a little more interesting. Follow along as Alex educates Mason on the art of seducing and pleasing a woman. Take notes as she introduces him to a whole new level of intensity and sexual pleasure. Study the sensual art of tantric sex as Alex creates her own style of silk and lace female dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little tryst will never survive past college--but Alex is determined to enjoy it the fullest while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
