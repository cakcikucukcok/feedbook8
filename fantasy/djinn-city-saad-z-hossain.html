  <title>Djinn City - Saad Z. Hossain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the author of the cult classic &lt;i&gt;Escape from Baghdad!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;Indelbed is a lonely kid living in a crumbling mansion in the super dense, super chaotic third world capital Of Bangladesh. His father, Dr. Kaikobad, is the black sheep of their clan, the once illustrious Khan Rahman family. A drunken loutish widower, he refuses to allow Indelbed go to school, and the only thing Indelbed knows about his mother is the official cause of her early demise: &quot;Death by Indelbed.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
But When Dr. Kaikobad falls into a supernatural coma, Indelbed and his older cousin, the wise-cracking slacker Rais, learn that Indelbed&#39;s dad was in fact a magician—and a trusted emissary to the djinn world. And the Djinns, as it turns out, are displeased. A &quot;hunt&quot; has been announced, and ten year-old Indelbed is the prey. Still reeling from the fact that genies actually exist, Indelbed finds himself on the run. Soon, the boys are at the center of a great Diinn controversy, one tied to the continuing fallout from an ancient war, with ramifications for the future of life as we know it.
&lt;br&gt;Saad Z. Hosscin updates the supernatural creatures Of Arabian mythology—a superior but by no means perfect species pushed to the brink by the staggering ineptitude of the human race. &lt;i&gt;Djinn City&lt;/i&gt; is a darkly comedic fanlasy adventure, and a stirring follow-up to Hossain&#39;s 2015 novel &lt;i&gt;Escape from Baghdad!&lt;/i&gt;, which &lt;i&gt;NPR&lt;/i&gt; called &quot;a hilarious and searing indictment of the project we euphemistically call &#39;nation-building.&#39;&quot;" />
