  <title>Happily Even After - Marilynn Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ellie Waters usually juggled career, family and church commitments with ease. But when her mother fell ill, coping suddenly seemed overwhelmingly difficult. For help she looked to the past–and within her deepest self.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charlene Butler, wife, grandmother and businesswoman, was enjoying a bright, new chapter of her life. But her aunt Dorothy&#39;s medical crisis suddenly made Charlene wonder how solid the foundation of her world really was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On their journeys of discovery, these two very different women met, shared the burden of being caretakers, and in doing so they became best friends. Together they laughed, prayed and found new strength and new depths to their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
