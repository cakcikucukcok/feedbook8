  <title>The Squire Detectives - Jacob Kimble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They are squires-in-training in their village, faithfully attending to their daily duties when alarming news of people mysteriously disappearing from nearby villages reaches their area. Joined by their friend Thomas, William and Peter are sent on a mission across the forest to investigate these supposed disappearances.
Halfway there, they stop to set up camp for the night, triggering the most terrifying experience of their lives! They flee blindly through the dark forest at night while relentlessly being pursued by an unseen terror. The next morning, William finds himself in the middle of the woods, separated from Peter and Thomas, and now everyone is plunged into danger.
Unbelieving townsfolk pile on more danger as their suspicions run wild against the boys. Surviving isnt enough; now they must clear their names as well!
What or who is truly responsible for the disappearances? What will Williams fate be? Will he survive? And will the squires faith be enough to sustain them?" />
