  <title>Fearless - K.M. Fawcett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;TWO SOULS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Myia, a shaman-in-training, wants desperately to protect her peaceful village from the barbaric Highland invaders. To hone her powers of prophetic visions and healing, the village elders send Myia on a quest to heal the Highland leader&#39;s heart and stop a brewing war. Myia&#39;s mended many souls before, so this should be an effortless duty . . . until she meets the gorgeous, stubborn Highland warlord.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ONE DESIRE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kedric, a gladiator who escaped enslavement, only wants to liberate the villagers from their common foe-a race that breeds humans for blood sport and genetic experiments. Fueled by his rage, Kedric is determined to take down the brutal enemy. So when a raven-haired beauty with a body made for sin tries to sabotage his mission, Kedric wants her gone. Yet no woman&#39;s touch has ever left Kedric more annoyed . . . and aroused. Kedric knows he should shun her soothing embrace-but he can&#39;t seem to stay away. As their passion grows, Kedric must decide between fighting his war or surrendering his rage-and his heart-for Myia&#39;s love.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; (85,000 words)" />
