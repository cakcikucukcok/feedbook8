  <title>A Cowboy&#39;s Plan (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Home on the Ranch, Book 41) - Mary Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;C. J. Wright has a simple strategy for his life. Get his ranch going. Sell the family&#39;s candy shop. And fix his relationship with his young son.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nowhere in his plan is there room for a woman like Janey Sweeter-than-She-Looks Wilson, his new employee. A tempting mix of contradictions, she&#39;s a puzzle he&#39;d love to solve. More, her city-girl exterior calls to his wild side–that rodeo-riding guy he turned his back on. The one who could jeopardize all he&#39;s working for now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But things get interesting when his son becomes attached to Janey. C.J.&#39;s forced to look beyond her surface to the woman inside. Could the emotional connection he finds persuade him to change all his plans?&lt;/p&gt;
