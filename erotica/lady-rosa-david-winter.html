  <title>Lady Rosa - David Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lady Rosalinda de Mari-Alphorns, an only child lived with her parents at their manor house in the rural area of Sussex. She was a young naive religious girl who always attended the church situated in their grounds. This is where she was tricked into marriage by the vicar, a vile sexual predator who belonged to a like minded group of men. These men considered themselves to be above the law and pleasured themselves in whatever degrading acts of sexual perversion their sadistic minds could imagine. She lived in this world and could do nothing about events within it as these men were too powerful but she tried. This led to the RFF where she was left to die in disgusting conditions. From this she had one chance in a lifetime to live, should she take it, was this all too good to be true or should she just give up as damaged goods and go to prison for murdering her husband." />
