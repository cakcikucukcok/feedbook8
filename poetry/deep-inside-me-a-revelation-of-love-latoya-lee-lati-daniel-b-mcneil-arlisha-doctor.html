  <title>Deep Inside Me:  a Revelation of Love - Latoya Lee-Lati, Daniel B. McNeil, Arlisha Doctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; This is a collection of writings that date from years 2004-2009. I grant you permission to read as I reflect on my personal circumstances. The release of these personal matters has been a healing process for me. At the end of it all, I had exactly what I started with-God and myself. I didn&#39;t need a physician to tell me I had a problem. I experienced both physical and emotional trauma throughout my childhood. In my youth I witnessed drug and alcohol abuse, prostitution, domestic violence and crime of all sorts. Subconsciously I didn&#39;t neither want nor know how to be alone. I truly possessed a personal need to always feel comforted. In addition to my need for comfort, my sexually driven emotions had me traveling down a self paved road of confusion and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With self examination and the awesome grace of God, I have become a more pious, encouraging and conscious woman. I&#39;ve learned what it means to be patient and love myself completely. I am in no way ashamed of my past. I am grateful for the lessons learned and the new respect I have for myself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
