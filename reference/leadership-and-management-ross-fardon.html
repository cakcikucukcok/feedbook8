      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the book of a lifetime, about the practical basics of all management everywhere. To succeed at Wimbledon, you have to believe, get super-fit, read the game, and play every stroke excellently  the same in managing things. If managers were measured by results every week, this book would be compulsory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Every sentence is from success or failure  both teach us a lot. There is no jargon. Neither is there another book like it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It works, from the Third World to high tech and big business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is a hand-book of how, and a standard. It should be modified for the particulars of each workplace.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What it teaches is immensely rewarding, for managers, workers and unions. For families, clubs and charities as well as business and government.&lt;/p&gt;
