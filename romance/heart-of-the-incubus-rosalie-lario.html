  <title>Heart of the Incubus - Rosalie Lario</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Biochemist Cresso Taylor lives the sort of lifestyle most men would envy--he has wealth, natural incubus charm, and more women than he can handle. But it&#39;s not enough anymore. Not after meeting Genevieve Russell, the sexy scientist who works with him at Elcorp Laboratory. And she wants absolutely nothing to do with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her fiancé broke her heart, Genevieve has had enough of womanizers. She&#39;s determined to steer clear of sexy-as-sin Dr. Taylor, despite the fact that his incubus allure makes her want to rip his clothes off. But when a secret admirer&#39;s affection turns to the macabre with threatening notes and grisly gifts, Cresso appoints himself her protector. As she and Cresso hunt her stalker, she discovers there&#39;s a lot more to the sensual incubus than she ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Demons of Infernum series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book #1 Blood of the Demon&lt;br&gt; Book #2 Mark of the Sylph&lt;br&gt; Book #3 Touch of the Angel&lt;br&gt;Book #3.5: Heart of the Incubus&lt;br&gt; Book #4 Call of the Siren&lt;/p&gt;" />
