  <title>Missing Frames - Scooter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hidden disabilities are real. Just ask Scooter, survivor of two traumatic brain injuriesone from a 1976 car accident and the other related to a 2009 fall. Limited cognitively, Scooter suffers from memory loss and chronic pain. Still, Scooter is living proof that after a sudden life change, it truly is possible to overcome adversity, find joy and forgiveness, and become a stronger person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her inspirational narrative, Scooter shares a glimpse into the events before, during, and after her second life-changing injury as she attempted to find her way back from the darkness of amnesia and into the light of healing. As she battled physical discomfort and psychological challenges that involved all aspects of perception, thinking, reasoning, and memory, Scooter details how she relied on an archangel physician to provide the tether to reality and much-needed structure while she bravely battled many obstacles to reclaim and rebuild her life as an intelligent and resilient single mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing Frames shares the true story of one womans journey through unseen health challenges as she finds peace and strength amid pain and suffering and raises awareness about invisible disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
