  <title>Elena - R E Shrubb</title>

an empire&lt;BR&gt;
__________________________________________________&lt;BR&gt;
HIStory - or should it be HERstory?&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;As is the case in some societies today, for the fi rst 
300 years of the Roman Empire, women were the possessions of 
men. Many women resisted, some dying horribly rather than 
obeying orders to marry men chosen for them.  HIStory barely 
mentions them.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Another example of HIStory is the conversion of the 
Roman Empire from pagan
to Christian by Constantine the Great. He issued the 
decrees.&lt;BR&gt;
But:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;- his early coins have the Unvanquished Sun as their 
religious symbol,
&lt;BR&gt;- his victory arch in Rome bears pagan symbols..
&lt;BR&gt;- he was ruthless in destroying opponents.
&lt;BR&gt;- he had his fi rst born son executed,
&lt;BR&gt;- he had his wife murdered in her bath.
&lt;BR&gt;- he was not baptised until his death-bed.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;His mother Elena nurtured him through the turmoils and
dangers of the time and became an important fi gure at
court. She founded churches around the empire and gained
a reputation as a holy person. She is regarded by the 
eastern church as equal to the apostles.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;The HERstory of Elena tells of her life from bar girl to 
empress through the perils of the late empire and its savage 
religious persecutions. It relates her role in the martyrdom 
of St George, the dramatic escape of Constantine from 
hostage of the pagan Galerius and her hand in guiding her 
son to his conquest of Rome." />
