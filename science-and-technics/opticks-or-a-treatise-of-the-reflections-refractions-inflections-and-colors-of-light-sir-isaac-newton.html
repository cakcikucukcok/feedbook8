  <title>Opticks: Or, a Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections, and Colors of Light - Sir Isaac Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is without a doubt one of the most well-known and influential scientists in history; he made incalculable contributions to the fields of physics, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy and theology. From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics while developing his theory of color. This led to his invention of the refracting telescope in 1672, which would correct chromatic aberration in the traditional refracting telescope, and so impressed the Royal Society that they encouraged him to publish his work. &quot;Opticks&quot; was Newton&#39;s second major contribution in this field, and offered new insights into the nature of color, light, and the phenomena of diffraction. The book also includes Newton&#39;s Queries, which address a wide range of physical phenomena, include the nature and transmission of heat, the possible cause of gravity, electrical phenomena, chemical action, and ethics of both science and human conduct." />
