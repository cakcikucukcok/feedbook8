  <title>Dating Basics 101 - David Linares</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Dating Basics 101&lt;/i&gt; is the first of a series of books designed to help make mans journey in dating and relationships easier. Unlike other dating books, the simple, step-by-step, comprehensive formula combines modern-day psychological principles and ancient philosophical concepts with meditative practices, paving the way to finding the right date.
Author David Linares starts by examining philosophical beliefs about women and dating, as well as common misconceptions that lead to anxiety and insecurity in men; he then offers effective ways to deal with these issues. Next, he explores the attitudes that women find attractive and interesting, how to effectively communicate with women, where to meet women, how to ask for a date, where to go, what to do, how to be romantic, and so much more.
This innovative guide will explain how to have self-confidence and to relax and enjoy the date. Some dating books help a certain kind of guy looking for a certain kind of girl. Others will explain how to get the girl, but not how to actually build up the confidence to do it. The primary purpose of &lt;i&gt;Dating Basics 101&lt;/i&gt; is to assist in gaining the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the world of dating." />
