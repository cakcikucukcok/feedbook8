  <title>Married a Virgin - Rutendo Samantha Nazitwere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a young age the Lord told me that I would write books and that my first book would be a testimony of how the Lord helped me to get married a virgin; he said it was going to be my duty to tell other ladies to walk in purity because that is what he desires for them all. At that age I did not even know I would get married a virgin but anything the Lord says comes to pass. Married a Virgin hopefully will help young women understand why the Lord desires us to walk in purity and resist the lusts of the flesh (1 john 2:16). A lot of young people today have multiple sexual partners and they do not understand that they are sinning against their own bodies and in the process forming ungodly soul ties. Children as young as 10 are sexually active because society does not dispute immorality. Engaging in sexual activity is actually viewed as a norm. As a counselor ,I have spoken to a lot of young children and this is their view. The social media, movies, and music potray sex in various forms thereby creating curiosity to explore sex at a premature age. Guidance ,counsel and advice are therefore important in a young persons life. Corinthians 6:18 says,
 Keep on running away from sexual immorality. Any other sin that a person commits is outside his body but the person who sins sexually sins against his own body.
There are many Christian women who are struggling with sex outside marriage but the Lord Jehovah is willing to forgive those who truly repent and change their lifestyles. God showed me a vision that made me understand the dangers of having sex outside of marriage in this generation. A lot of immorality is taking place in the world today. I do not think I am better than anyone else but my goal is to help people understand the importance of abiding by Gods commandments." />
