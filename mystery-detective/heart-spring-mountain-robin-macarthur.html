One thousand miles away&amp;#8212;while tending bar in New Orleans&amp;#8212;Vale receives a call and is told that her mother, Bonnie, has disappeared. Despite a years-long estrangement from Bonnie, Vale drops everything and returns home to look for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the hometown Vale comes back to is not the one she left eight years earlier, she finds herself falling back into the lives of the family she thought she&amp;#8217;d long since left behind. As Vale begins her search, the narrative opens up and pitches back and forth in time to follow three generations of women&amp;#8212;a farming widow, a back-to-the-land dreamer, and an owl-loving hermit&amp;#8212;as they seek love, bear children, and absorb losses.
