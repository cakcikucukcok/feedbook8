  <title>The Forgotten Phoenix - Dripta Guha Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Style that makes Dripta distinct:
In this book in Chapter III, Dripta has successfully merged prose and poetry in single piece carrying a singular theme with excellent harmony. The style makes him totally unique in poetry writing world and he made it possible because of his powerful yet sublime grip on language and expression that he mastered long ago. 
His poems are written in English, pre-eminently the worldwide language, which mention feelings that occupy the minds of many around the world: dreariness, loneliness, birth, death, longing for love, lost love, and love regained. In order to stress the importance of these universal aspects Dripta Roy does not localize his work. He thinks that his international background is an advantage, allowing him to approach the things he writes about from several points of view rather than from just one perspective. His use of symbolism in his poetry is an important one, and his poetry revolves around an array of talented thought and ideas.
Dripta explores birth, death, religion and sexuality in depth in all his poems. His poems talk to ones heart, and deals with the problems, and desires of many. He too captures the minds of many with his verses.  Poetry is simply a means of expression. A chance to speak out your mind, without having to care what others will say Dripta said.
Driptas poetry balances the elements of optimism and pessimism in perfect harmony. He speaks of God quite often, as though he is in search for the truth. After having talked to him, he feels as though he has found his true self through his poems. 
His new book not only consists of a new collection of poems, but also a whole new section, which is written in the form of prose. Each chapter reflects a single aspect of life, which starts in the form of a prose, and Dripta beautifully finishes each chapter with a poem that acts as an integral part of the prose, giving meaning to the chapter as a whole.
On the whole this is an excellent piece of work, which portrays a talented individual making magic once again." />
