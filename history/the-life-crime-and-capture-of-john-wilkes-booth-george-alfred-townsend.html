  <title>The Life, Crime, And Capture Of John Wilkes Booth - George Alfred Townsend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A detailed account of the man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln. This, in its day, was a &amp;quot;media sensation.&amp;quot; The assassination of Abraham Lincoln launched John Wilkes Booth into infamy--not the kind of &amp;quot;fame&amp;quot; he was hoping for. Townsend was a writer for the New York Herald and used the pen name &amp;quot;Gath&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a time when Lincoln was being martyred, a Christlike figure, while his assassin was being demonized, a Judas figure. With the country still in mourning in 1866, Gath had no trouble rousing people to heights of fury over the crime. He does it in this book.&lt;br /&gt;
Even today it is difficult to look at John Wilkes Booth as anyone other than the assassin. We forget that he was a well-known and very popular actor, young and handsome, and making money." />
