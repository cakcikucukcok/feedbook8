  <title>Gray Matter - Gary Braver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rachel Whitman has everything. She&#39;s young, attractive, and affluent. Her husband is the brilliant CEO of his own company. They have a big new house in a flossy Boston suburb. They have all the brand-name &quot;toys&quot; that go along with wealth. And they have a gorgeous, sweet little six-year-old son named Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dylan has learning disabilities. Although intelligence isn&#39;t everything, Rachel lives in a community where the rewards for brainpower are conspicuous. She fears her son will grow up never fully appreciating the wonders of life. Like so many middle-class parents who would do anything to improve life for their children--whether it means fixing hair, teeth, or nose--Rachel cannot accept that her child is less than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tortured by the idea that something she did in the past caused Dylan&#39;s problems, Rachel becomes obsessed with a secret and expensive medical procedure that claims to turn slow children into geniuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should she and her husband sacrifice their new fortune on the risky, experimental procedure for the sake of their son&#39;s happiness? Unaware of the real consequences of the brain enhancement procedure, Rachel can&#39;t know that the costs of the operation go far beyond financial ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
