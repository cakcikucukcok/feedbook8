  <title>More Hot Air - Tony Kordyban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More Hot Air is the long-awaited sequel to the author&#39;s previous ASME Press book, Hot Air Rises and Heat Sinks: Everything You Know About Cooling Electronics Is Wrong. This new book continues in the same humorous and easy-to-read style of the earlier book, with all-new, original case studies in the field of electronics cooling. Each case study, told as an anecdote, is designed to teach a basic concept of heat transfer, as applied to keeping electronics from overheating. 
Because of the constantly shrinking size of electronics, the job of cooling electronics continues to get tougher. Many people not trained in the basics of heat transfer have been roped into doing this job out of necessity. For those who lack any formal training in heat transfer, the case studies explode many of the myths about cooling electronics and replace these flawed practices with sound engineering, based on actual heat transfer theory. 
The case studies and humor in this book are also entertaining to those well versed in electronics cooling. A must-read book for all engineers and their managers concerned with electronics packaging." />
