  <title>The Lanzis I - Giancarlo Gabbrielli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Lanzis I, is the story of a courageous family. It takes you from the period that followed WWI, during the time of the rise of Fascism, up to and including WWII and the liberation of Italy by the Americans. This litterary novel bursts with reality; it is beautiful, painful and remorseless. Well known events are seen through new eyes, in an original and refreshingly appealing way. The story portrays &#39;real&#39; people as they are seldom characterized in North American litterature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lanzis, chronicles a proud family who resist the pressure of an autocratic Regime. It also depicts the poignant story of a young boy, sexually coming of age; his innocence set against the backdrop of the war. &lt;/p&gt;" />
