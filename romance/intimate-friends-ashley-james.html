Tory continues to ignore her Kim&amp;rsquo;s hints until she could no longer face being taunted.&amp;nbsp; Kim then sets up a night for them two, and attempts to catch Tory in her net. After being dared to pop an ecstasy pill and sipping a few drinks, information begins to spill out of the two. They soon confess things to each other that should have never gotten out.

EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
She began to lean towards me. Before I could realize what she was doing, she gave me a warm, juicy kiss. Her lips were so soft, and as soon as mine touched hers, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop. As I kissed her, my hands freely ran up and down her legs. I sucked on her soft lips, and listened to her softly moan and breathe harder." />
