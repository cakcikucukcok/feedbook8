  <title>Adoption and the Gospel - Gerald D. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adoption and The Gospel delivers sound biblical doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that most have never heard. One does not need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to be a bible scholar to understand its message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald Clark chronicles his struggle to overcome his traditional image of an orphanage, and how he learned from heart wrenching personal experiences with the children what they so desperately want and need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years working with children in an orphanage in the Philippines left Gerald and his wife seeking answers to difficult and very troubling questions. If God loves me, why am I an orphan? If you love me, why dont you adopt me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept asking myself , Whats wrong with this picture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much we love and care for children in an orphanage, theyre still orphans. Whats wrong with the picture is that we simply dont understand that children just dont want to BE orphans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would we need more orphanages if Adoption was part of the Global Mission Strategy of every evangelical church in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoption says something about the Gospel and Gods love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that no other word can say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel is incomplete if it fails to include adoption&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came into the world to bring us a living example of Gods love, so that we might receive the adoption as sons! Galatians 4:4-5 As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God. John 1:12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to the worlds orphan crisis is found in the bible. Adoption Ministry equips the church to accomplish the task, and God has called millions of families around the world who already want to adopt!&lt;/p&gt;" />
