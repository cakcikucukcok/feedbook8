  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Thirteen Years Later - Jasper Kent</i></b> | Jasper Kent's début novel " Twelve " was a well-paced action horror novel, set during the Napoleonic War in Russia in 1812. Its sequel, "Thirteen Years Later", is set, not surprisingly, in 1825, in the months leading up to the sudden and mysterious death of Tsar Alexander I and the subsequent so-called Decembrist Uprising.<br /><b><i>Thirteen Years Later (Danilov Quintet): Kent, Jasper ...</i></b> | As the title might suggest, this sequel to Twelve is set thirteen years after the first, in 1825. Things have moved on a little here, not only for the reason that Jasper has again chosen a key event of Russian history.<br /><b><i>Thirteen Years Later (The Danilov Quintet, #2) by Jasper Kent</i></b> | Jasper has spent almost twenty years working as a software engineer in the UK and in Europe, while also working on writing both fiction and music. In that time, he has produced the novels Twelve, Thirteen Years Later, Yours Etc., Mr. Sunday, and Sifr, and he has cowritten several musicals, including The Promised Land and Remember!<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Thirteen Years Later - Jasper Kent</a> </h3></p><hr/>
