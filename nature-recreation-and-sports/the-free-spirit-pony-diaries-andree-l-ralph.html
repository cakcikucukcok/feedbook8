  <title>The Free Spirit Pony Diaries - Andree L Ralph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Free Spirit Pony Diaries....... or perhaps this should be titled &#39;The journal of a slightly &#39;odd&#39; horsewoman, her infinitely patient &#39;other half&#39;, 13 independent ponies (including the &#39;just a bit too big to be ponies&#39; ones), 3 hilarious pigs and 5 very energetic Jack Russells&#39;.  When I first moved to East Sussex, UK over a decade ago, with 7 ponies in tow to &#39;start a riding school&#39;, little did I know that the ponies had other ideas.....  12 years later and we are on a very different path - a far better and more rewarding one but one which has challenges all of it&#39;s own!  Inside the covers of this E-book you&#39;ll find our journey between November 2011 and December 2014, exactly as it happened and as it was recorded on our Facebook Page - The Free Spirit Ponies - the ups and downs; the tears and the laughter, but most of all, you&#39;ll find the story of how our horses reminded me of what it really means to love horses." />
