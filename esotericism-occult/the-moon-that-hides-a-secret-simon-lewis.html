  <title>The Moon That Hides a Secret - Simon Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I was a child I loved looking at the stars. The Moon was always my favourite. It was so close, yet so far away. Its presence was always a wonderful sight to see. Sometimes it would glow and other times show its cratered surface. I felt a connection, whilst being entranced by its beauty. To walk on the Moon must have been awesome and at the same time mesmerising. When the space race started and the first probes reached the Moon and people walked upon its surface, it was no longer a secret place. Slowly reports started to surface of strange occurrences, anomalies, conversations, pictures and even film. All this was to feed an interest far greater than I ever expected. We were not the first visitors and it was best to keep the secrets than tell the world. 
We are not alone!" />
