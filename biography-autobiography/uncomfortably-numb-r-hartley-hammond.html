  <title>Uncomfortably Numb - R. Hartley Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A weary, middle-aged professional, risks it all resulting in an unexpected journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Richard Hammond does not like to live in the past. Instead, he is a here-and-now kind of guy who tries to stay optimistic, even during the darkest times. Always one to embrace change and take risks, Richard takes stock of his life and shares what he has learned with others. This is the story of his adventurous journey through life, his takeaway lessons, and how he taught himself to look beyond the confines of his own reality in order to reach for the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hammond shares the poignant, sometimes humorous story of his life to date, he provides a glimpse into the after-effects of the 2008 financial crisis that caused him to make an unforeseen move from working a lucrative job in corporate America to cleaning dog kennels. With a tongue-in-cheek style, Hammond details how his life slowly disintegrated from days filled with mental stimulation to days filled with trips to Walmart and caring for his ailing mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he contemplates his uncertain future, Hammond reminisces about his childhood innocence, his coming-of-age journey into adulthood, and how he ended up on a road heading in the wrong direction. Uncomfortably Numb is the story of one mans walk through an unpredictable existence where he soon discovers that no one can recreate the second chapter in his life but him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
