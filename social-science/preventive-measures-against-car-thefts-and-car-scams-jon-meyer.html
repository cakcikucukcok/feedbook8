  <title>Preventive Measures Against Car Thefts and Car Scams - Jon Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This booklet by Jonathan Meyer is a wonderful example of combining your personal
and professional skills for the benefit of others. This material will benefit you on
the topics of car theft, insurance fraud, and personal safety; topics of concern for
every motor vehicle driver. Add to this subject Mr. Meyer&#39;s knowledge of Martial Arts;
which has its core, the value of preparation, observation, and proactive defensive.
Together they are a perfect example towards the creation of effective risk management
to reduce &quot;real world&quot; risks. And together you have a new and comprehensive resource
on a subject that has been present since the beginning of the automobile.
Everyone who drives a motor vehicle has the exposures covered in this material. We all
want to protect the significant value of our vehicle. But more importantly, we need to
protect ourselves from personal harm. While on the surface the topics presented may
seem hard wired into our minds, in reality they need to be visited and revisited. They
need to be shared with both new drivers and drivers of all ages.
