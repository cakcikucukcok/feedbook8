  <title>Boundless - R. A. Salvatore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This second book in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author R. A.

That inner turmoil was magnified by his inferior position as a male dark elf in the matriarchal drow society. Only his status as one of the greatest warriors&amp;#8212;as well as his friendship with the mercenary Jarlaxle&amp;#8212;kept him sane. When he finally perished, he was content knowing he left behind a legacy as substantial as his son Drizzt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except . . . someone isn&amp;#8217;t ready for Zaknafein to be dead. And now he&amp;#8217;s back, hundreds of years later, in a world he doesn&amp;#8217;t recognize. His son&amp;#8217;s companions are not the prideful&amp;#8212;and bigoted&amp;#8212;males the drow warrior was accustomed to in his previous life. Drizzt&amp;#8217;s circle includes dwarves, elves, and, perhaps worst of all, a human wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling to navigate this transformed new world, Zaknafein realizes that some things have not changed: the threat of demons and the machinations of a drow matron no longer content with her family&amp;#8217;s position in the ranks of Houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he has been displaced in time, Zaknafein is still a warrior. And no matter what prejudices he must overcome, he knows he will do his duty and fight by Drizzt&amp;#8217;s side to stem the tide of darkness that threatens the Realms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
