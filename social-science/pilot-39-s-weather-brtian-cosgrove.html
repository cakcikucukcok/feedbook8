  <title>Pilot&#39;s Weather - Brtian Cosgrove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book breaks new ground in the presentation of what is and should be presented as a fascinating and vitally important part of a pilot&#39;s skill. Gone are the dreary old monotone drawings of isobars and fronts, endless graphs and reams of figures and in bounce full colour photos of what you actually see - clouds and cloudscapes that tell you instantly what&#39;s happening to the air around you. For those who fly aircraft and micros, gliders or kites, this book makes the weather make sense. &quot;The content of the book deals comprehensively with all the topics likely to come up in the PPL exams, and more importantly tries, and succeeds, to weld them together into a coherent and useful whole. Meteorology can be a dry and technical subject but this book does better than most at holding the reader&#39;s interest, helped a great deal by the excellent photos. The photos illustrate all types of cloud, frontal weather, and most other meteorological phenomena. This is a welcome change from the usual line drawings which bear little relation to reality found in the majority of aviation weather books. &quot; - MICROLIGHT FLYING &quot;Everything the pilot needs to know about the atmosphere, the weather and meteorology. The colour photographs are superb: these alone make the book worth having on one&#39;s shelf.&quot; - AOPA LIGHT AVIATION &quot;. . . a few hours regularly spent within the pages of Brian Cosgrove&#39;s book would seem to be time well spent.&quot; - GUILD NEWS (GAPAN)." />
