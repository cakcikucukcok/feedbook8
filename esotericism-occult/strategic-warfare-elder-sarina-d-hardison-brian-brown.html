  <title>Strategic Warfare - Elder Sarina D. Hardison, Brian Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In warfare God wants His people to move strategically and not haphazardly. Having the knowledge of Christ, but denying His power is like electricity that powers a house being cut loose and its power becoming deadly to everyone it meets. The house still has its power, but the power cannot effectively be used for its purpose, because it lacks direction. Every situation in our lives can have a beneficial end and if we use strategy to overcome the trials of life by functioning skillfully, its possible to actually miss the bumps in the road, but moving haphazardly we are sure to be snared in every one of them.  
Elder Sarina D. Hardison is a single mother of one son who was called to the ministry at the age of twenty-three. In August of 2003, she was ordained as an Elder of Works of Deliverance Fellowship International Ministries in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. She was later ordained as Associate Pastor. Elder Hardison is determined to please the Lord in all that she does, and by writing this book she is hoping to impact the lives of many by encouraging them to follow the Father no matter what the cost." />
