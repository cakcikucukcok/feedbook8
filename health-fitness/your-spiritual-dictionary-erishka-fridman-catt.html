  <title>Your Spiritual Dictionary - Erishka Fridman-Catt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Being human is full-time job that does not always pay well.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While spiritual evolution occurs collectively, personal growth takes place individually.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We are all here on our personal journeys together. As we grow individually, we contribute to collective advancement, and as we evolve collectively, we improve our personal lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When you feel stuck, it is natural to think, &lt;i&gt;If only I were somewhere elsethings would be different. If only something in my environment (my partner, my kids, my parents, my job, my home) were different, Id be okay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The good news is that you are able to craft the life you desire from where you currently are.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For each of us, different ways will work best at different stages of life. When something isnt working for youwhether it is your job, marriage, conflict with friends or children, or your pet just stops listeninga natural reaction is to withdraw or to leave. Sometimes it is the only solution left, and this is exactly what needs to be done. However, this is not always the case, especially if the situation involves children or other loved ones.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are times when we are simply not happy with where we are in life. And there are times when we see what we want and dont know how to get it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your Spiritual Dictionary&lt;/i&gt; offers practical tools for resolving issues, dealing with everyday routine situations, transforming daily obstacles in to opportunities for growth, and making the most out of present life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
