  <title>Gypsies, Tramps and MD&#39;s - Magic Mike Productions</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A true blue dyed in the wool heterosexual modern male chauvinistic pig learns against his will what it is to be female.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I had no idea a woman had to deal with so many different emotions and all seemingly at the same time, I now understood why I had always thought all women were bat shit crazy, how could a man ever truly understand and appreciate how complex the female thought process was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Men only think on one level and one thing at a time, we&amp;#39;re hunters zeroing in on our prey nothing else matter except assessing the situation, our goal to take down the prey. This equates to everything in our lives. Think about it, watch a man shopping for a pair of pants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A man&amp;rsquo;s thought process; &amp;ldquo;I know what I want, I know how to achieve that goal&amp;hellip; now attack&amp;rdquo;. Men don&amp;rsquo;t shop, they zero in on their target, stalk it and make the kill, In and out of the store in under fifteen minutes, our goal achieved and satisfied. &amp;ldquo;Time for a beer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for a woman&amp;rsquo;s thought process; a woman can think on multiple levels and multiple things on each level all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In ancient times, they were the care-givers and gatherers. Gathering eatables at the same time caring for a crying baby and thinking the cave needs to be swept out and what she can do to make big strong hunter happy when he returns with fresh meat or how to make him miserable if he returns empty-handed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To say I was confused would have been the understatement of the century, though I will admit as of late, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as confused. The two halves of my mind weren&amp;rsquo;t fighting for control so much anymore. The feminine side had won, what was left of my male ego was going the way of the dodo bird&amp;hellip; extinct; it just didn&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.&lt;br /&gt;
