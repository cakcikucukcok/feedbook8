  <title>The Future of Affirmative Action: New Paths to Higher Education Diversity after Fisher v. University of Texas - Richard D. Kahlenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the United States experiences dramatic demographic change-and as our society&#39;s income inequality continues to rise-promoting racial, ethnic, and economic inclusion at selective colleges has become more important than ever. At the same time, however, many Americans-including several members of the U.S. Supreme Court-are uneasy with explicitly using race as a factor in college admissions. The Court&#39;s decision in Fisher v. University of Texas emphasized that universities can use race in admissions only when &quot;necessary,&quot; and that universities bear &quot;the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.&quot;  With race-based admission programs increasingly curtailed, The Future of Affirmative Action explores race-neutral approaches as a method of promoting college diversity after Fisher decision. The volume suggests that Fisher might on the one hand be a further challenge to the use of racial criteria in admissions, but on the other presents a new opportunity to tackle, at long last, the burgeoning economic divisions in our system of higher education, and in society as a whole.
