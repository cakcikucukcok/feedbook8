Haydens Bouquet of Blessings is an inspirational book, that teaches children how to see things from a positive perspective. It is the genuine act of compassion from one child to another. The heartfelt message to Hold on Stay Strong, through adversity are beautiful affirmations that Hayden received from her Glammi. Haydens Bouquet of Blessings is evidence that caring is sharing. It gives young readers the opportunity to gain self-acceptance by loving their own reflection, as well as identifying with others who might share some likeness. Delivering a spoonful of kisses; the tenderness of a hug and the warmth of a blanket, it is the declaration of beauty rather than ashes and roses as opposed to rocks. In its simplicity Haydens Bouquet of Blessings is a beautiful floral arrangement comprised of children of all colors, creeds and nationalities wrapped in a ribbon of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
