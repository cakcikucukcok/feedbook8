  <title>Intoxication - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three days in Vegas should be enough to cure Glenna of her cheating ex-boyfriend. But when she wakes up with a head-pounding hangover in a strange beach house, inexplicably married to a man she remembers only vaguely, this proves to be one binge that&#39;s gone too far! When she spies a bondage rack in full view, Glenna&#39;s even more alarmed. Though she&#39;s a daring sexual adventuress, sadomasochism is far beyond her idea of fun - at least that&#39;s what she thinks. While the bizarre scenario sends her fleeing fast, Glenna&#39;s strangely hooked, hypnotized by the beach house, the rack, and the thrilling sexual promises of Alec Falconer - her husband. Submission, slavery...the ideas gnaw at her and she returns to Alec for an experiment in sexual surrender. Her exhibitionist streak gets quite a workout when she&#39;s forced to crudely submit before Alec&#39;s friends and forced deeply into S&amp;M desires she can hardly understand. Glenna&#39;s life gets more complicated... anonymous phone calls, a stalking cameraman... drugged, auctioned, kidnapped by a club of sexual deviants... Is this her husband or the ex-boyfriend who pursues her with relentless passion that has her frightened and intrigued?&lt;/p&gt;" />
