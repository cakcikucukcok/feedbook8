      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Valley of Genius: The Uncensored History of Silicon Valley (As Told by the Hackers, Founders, and Freaks Who Made It Boom) by Adam Fisher | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Valley of Genius: The Uncensored History of Silicon Valley (As Told by the Hackers, Founders, and Freaks Who Made It Boom) is Adam Fisher&amp;rsquo;s debut non-fiction book. This book is a colorful and candid rendering of the history of Silicon Valley. He tells the story of how giant companies like Atari and Apple started. He also reveals the Facebook and Google&amp;rsquo;s clashes in the present day. Fisher writes the comprehensive oral history of the significant start-ups and disruptions that they encounter on their way to success. &amp;nbsp;Silicon Valley characteristically does not fight change but rather it embraces change. Its adaptability to change enabled it to power the majority of the American economy and innovations globally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New York Times bestselling author of Nurtureshock Po Bronson says that Valley of Genius &amp;ldquo;will remind us of the true nature of the innovation process.&amp;rdquo; The Long Tail and Makers: The New Industrial Revolution author Chris Anderson admires the beauty of oral history and says that Valley of Genius is &amp;ldquo;gripping.&amp;rdquo; How to Make a Spaceship author Julian Guthrie praises Adam Fisher&amp;rsquo;s writing skills and describes it as &amp;ldquo;original in its construction, prodigious, funny, raw and polished.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
