      <meta name="description" content="As Christmas approached,Hope wished for Donovan to propose. He seemed like such a great man and he treated her son as if he were his own. Of course putting a bullet in your boyfriend&#39;s heart, hardly ever leads to the sound of wedding bells. Donovan had been so full of promises. Well promises and lies. Good thing for Hope, she&#39;d been the better shot. Now a new monster stalks Hope and her son. Liam, Donovan&#39;s psychotic brother and partner in the family&#39;s cocaine business will stop at nothing to claim his revenge. No one is safe including Hope&#39;s new boss turned love interest the talented painter, Asher Stone. Thankfully Hope has a few allies of her own. But can Asher help slay the monster or will Liam be the one painting Seattle a bright shade of red." />
