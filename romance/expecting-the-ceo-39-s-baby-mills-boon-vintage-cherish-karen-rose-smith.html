  <title>Expecting the CEO&#39;s Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Karen Rose Smith</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BABY BOND&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For months Jenna Winton had envisioned another man&#39;s features on her precious growing baby. That was before she&#39;d learned about the medical mix-up that brought a powerful stranger to her door demanding his child!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From their first meeting, Jenna knew that Blake Winston always got what he wanted. And within weeks she found herself wed to this selfmade CEO who promised their child everything he&#39;d never had and who vowed to resist making their marriage real until she was ready. Perhaps it was the yearning he stirred at a touch or his tender look when he felt their baby kick, but suddenly Blake was consuming her heart and dreams…even when she couldn&#39;t be certain of his love….&lt;/p&gt;
