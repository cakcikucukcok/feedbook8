  <title>My Book of Categories - Rachel Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Categorizing is an important cognitive function by which we group things according to a common characteristic, and name items that share that characteristic.  Categorizing helps us perceive and organize the world around us, from the most basic concepts such as colors and shapes, to the most complex aspect of our lives like medicine and chemistry. We use categorizing from sorting mail, to organizing our desk, to planning a nutritious and balanced meal. Categorizing can also be used as a tool to help our memory! This book helps a child understand and develop the concept of categories, name them and identify items that belong to them. Active participation of the child is encouraged by identifying the categories of additional items found in the back of the book, and cutting and pasting each item onto the correct category page. The child can expand his book by adding his own categories that are of interest to him on additional pages provided. Name the category on the top of the page and find and paste pictures of items that belong to it! Help your child or student understand this important concept. Encourage him to broaden his awareness and perception of the world around him through this book!&lt;/p&gt;" />
