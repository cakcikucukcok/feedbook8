  <title>Shattered Masks - Lyman A. Montgomery Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, image is everything! Imagine navigating through childhood and your adult life carrying the baggage of being bullied or called a sissy because you were unable to stand up for yourself. Lyman Montgomery lived that life and suffered great and consistent losses.  Before age of 14, he was sexually abused by a trusted teacher and experienced the death of two of his grandparents-one of which took her own life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyman kept silent about his abuse, avoided dealing with the grief of his fathers death by never mentioning him, associated with people who were better off financially, developed unhealthy relationships with women, performed as others expected, used accomplishments to feel better about himself and projected a religious lifestyle that was not rooted in righteousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shattered Masks: 7 Masks We Wear is an autobiographical account of how masks are made in a young person&#39;s life.  It is also a self-study to help you identify the mask makers in your life and to shatter the masks youve grown accustomed to wearing. &lt;/p&gt;" />
