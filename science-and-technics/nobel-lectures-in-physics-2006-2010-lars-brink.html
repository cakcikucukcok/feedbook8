  <title>Nobel Lectures in Physics (2006 - 2010) - Lars Brink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This volume is a collection of the Nobel lectures delivered by the prizewinners, together with their biographies and the presentation speeches by Nobel Committee members for the period 2006&amp;#x2013;2010. The criterion for the Physics award is to the discoverer of a physical phenomenon that changed our views, or to the inventor of a new physical process that gave enormous benefits to either science at large or to the public. The biographies are remarkably interesting to read and the Nobel lectures provide detailed explanations of the phenomena for which the Laureates were awarded the Nobel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspiring young scientists as well as more experienced ones, but also the interested public will learn a lot from and appreciate the geniuses of these narrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;List of prizewinners and their discoveries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2006)&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;John C Mather&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;George F Smoot&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x201C;for their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation&amp;#x201D;&lt;br/&gt;The very detailed observations that the Laureates have carried out from the COBE satellite have played a major role in the development of modern cosmology into a precise science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2007) &lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;Albert Fert&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Peter Gr&amp;#x00FC;nberg&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x201C;for the discovery of Giant Magnetoresistance&amp;#x201D;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of this phenomenon have revolutionized techniques for retrieving data from hard disks.
