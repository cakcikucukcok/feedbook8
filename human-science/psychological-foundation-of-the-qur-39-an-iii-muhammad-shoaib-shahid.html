  <title>Psychological Foundation of the Qur&#39;an Iii - Muhammad Shoaib Shahid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a professor and psychotherapist, I have found that the current Western research is not only subjective and a creation of only the past 125 years ago, it is culturally biased and of limited human personal experiences. Therefore, I have challenged these aspects by narrating the rational, objective and universal fundamental knowledge provided 1,430 years ago by the Creator that comes in action after death in an accountability process without individual discrimination (for example, please see Chapter 1-I).
My most difficult task was to pinpoint the causes and solutions of human sufferings and depict the mental health principles presented in the Qur&#39;an 1,430 years ago that turned the ignorant and arrogant tribal Arab people into the most civilized, model nation of the world. They turned out to be leaders in various faculties of science, technology and social sciences. I have not only presented the analysis but also the solutions for its application in daily life affairs (please see Chapter 9-I).
My sole mission is to provide logical and authentic knowledge of the Qur&#39;an throughout the world for creating insight among laypeople that the Creator knows better about His human being (a deputy and the most desired creature on earth) who gets derailed, becomes extremist and arrogant under worldly persuasions, and forgets the ultimate end of life. The solutions and guidelines to pass a moderate, purposeful life are available but one has to open up, understand and act on the given directions. I believe that my contribution in these books is the first time that APA-standardized tools have been applied, along with direct references to the Qur&#39;an, for the adolescents, truth-seekers, and psychologists. I think at this age level, I must contribute all my energy to pass on this message to everyone." />
