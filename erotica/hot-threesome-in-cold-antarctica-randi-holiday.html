  <title>Hot Threesome in Cold Antarctica - Randi Holiday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marisa is nineteen and secluded in an age-related isolation experiment. On New Year&#39;s Eve, she makes a wish and is surprised when two men appear for a kinky visit. One is young and the other is old enough to be her father, but both men are ripped and sexy as hell. They want to show her what she&#39;s been missing in life, and their methods are irresistible as the two insatiable men take her just about every way possible.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
Deciding to play along, she headed to the airlock switch. Even though this was breaking several rules of the study, she was feeling a bit tipsy and was pretty sure hallucinations didn&#39;t count anyway. With an overly bright and welcoming smile, Marisa threw the lever to open the door, so that her hallucination could come in out of the freezing cold.
“Goodness me, but it&#39;s cold out there!” the man announced as he stepped inside, his white linen loincloth doing little to keep him warm as he let the robe fall to the floor. He rubbed at his body briefly to warm himself then smiled at the woman. “Happy old year, Marisa,” he greeted her, offering her a hand and when she instinctively took it, he pulled her into a warm embrace. He kissed her deeply, his strong arms wrapped around her soothingly to caress her back with unexpectedly warm hands.
“I&#39;m the old year, Twenty-Sixteen, but you can call me Sixteen for short,” he told her with a smile as he kissed her again. His lips pressed to hers, and his tongue probed into her mouth. He paused, pulling back to nod toward the air lock. “The new year, Seventeen, will be here soon, you know?”
Marisa tilted her head, not understanding what he said, but figuring that figments of her imagination didn&#39;t need to make sense. However, this one sure did smell wonderful. She didn&#39;t know what cologne he wore, but it was amazing. The matter at hand seemed much more important and she focused on his soft lips against hers. She&#39;d always been attracted to older men, and besides, it was traditional to kiss someone on New Year&#39;s Eve. She got to her toes and wrapped her arms around his neck, returning his kiss and opening her mouth for his tongue. Her body was small against his large one, and she pressed her body against him, thrilled to be in someone’s arms again.
Another knock at the airlock had her eyes flying open, but she wasn&#39;t willing to stop the kiss, and neither was the old man. He carefully walked them over, so that he could open it without stopping. His blue eyes twinkled at both Marisa and the new arrival as he caught her lip between his teeth.
A handsome young man close to her age stepped inside and closed the airlock behind him. A thrill ran through her at the sight of him, because he was pure perfection. His blond hair was long and thick, and his all-over tan was very obvious, given the thin &quot;Happy New Year&quot; sash and loincloth he wore. “Not a fit start to my year, Sixteen,” he commented as he stepped up to the pair and pressed his large body against Marisa&#39;s back.
“Indeed not, but we&#39;ll warm up quickly I&#39;m sure,” Sixteen pointed out as he lowered the lab coat down Marisa&#39;s shoulders.
&quot;Hi,&quot; she chirped, now speaking to her newest hallucination in a hope that he wouldn&#39;t disappear.
&quot;Mmmmm…well, hello,&quot; he replied, brushing her hair aside and kissing her neck.
&quot;Uh, am I hallucinating?&quot; she asked, closing her eyes to savor the feeling of their bodies against hers.
Their hands were quick and sure as they removed her clothes and her breath grew heavier. Their kisses didn&#39;t miss a beat on her neck, ears and lips while she briefly worried about how to write this up in her daily log. She was swiftly stripped naked and embraced between their muscled bodies, being crushed between them. Their hands running over her body brought a shiver of anticipation and she quickly recalled the erotic things she&#39;d imagined in all of the kinky fantasies that she never imagined living out." />
