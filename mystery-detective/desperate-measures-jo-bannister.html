  <title>Desperate Measures - Jo Bannister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Gabriel Ash&#39;s wife and kids were kidnapped four years ago by  Somali pirates, his life spiraled out of control. He left his job  working for the British government and moved to a small town where he  descended into near madness. But with the help of his dog, Patience, and  his friendship with young police officer Hazel Best, his focus  returned. So when he discovers that his wife is still alive, Ash is once  again filled with hope and fear.  Hope that he has another chance to  find her and their two young sons; fear that, in trying, he may bring  about their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hazel is deeply worried for Ash. But even she  is unprepared for what Ash seems willing to do to secure the safety of  his wife and children. In fact, nothing is as it seems and loyalty,  friendship, and family bonds will be called into question. When Ash  learns who was behind the events that wrecked his life and his sanity,  even the resourceful Hazel might not be able to keep him from getting  hurt. How much is Ash willing to sacrifice in order to bring his family  home and bring justice to those responsible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo Bannister&#39;s  police procedurals are widely praised  for outstanding plotting and  suspense, and  their brilliant and compelling characterization. &lt;i&gt;Desperate Measures, &lt;/i&gt;the third novel in  the series following &lt;i&gt;Deadly Virtues &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Perfect Sins, &lt;/i&gt;is an engrossing novel from &quot;one of the undersung treasures of the mystery genre.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
