  <title>Witnessing Conversations with Heaven - Susan H. Kastner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you give to have a daily conversation with a lost soul mate, whether it is a spouse, parent, sibling, relative, child, or best friend? Dr. Liong Tee understood that need when his soul mate passed away. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider the possibility there have been many signs from your loved one, both big and small, that were right in front of you all the time but you simply failed to recognize them. Have you ever asked yourself why you keep experiencing a familiar smell, a certain shape, a distinctive color, a special flower, or perhaps a favorite animal that appears over and over again, reminding you of your lost loved one? Or did you simply brush those incidents aside, dismissing them as only being a coincidence?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on his written journals, follow Dr. Tees incredible story of conversations, signs, and messages received from his lost soul mate, Jan, since her passing in June 2008." />
