  <title>POETRY FOR ST. VALENTINE&#39;S DAY - 91 poems for the lovestruck - Various, Compiled by Tom Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A GREAT READ&amp;nbsp; FOR THE ROMANTIC SOULS OF THIS WORLD&lt;i&gt;, especially for St. Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The verse in this volume were&amp;nbsp; selected from works that had appeared in various periodicals of the time, LIFE, TRUTH, TOWN TOPICS, VOGUE, and MUNSEY&amp;#39;S MAGAZINE during the five years 1893-1898, the 19th C&amp;rsquo;s Romantic period, &amp;nbsp;and whose editors kindly gave Tom Hall permission to republish them. So popular was this collection of poetry, that it had at least six print runs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is made up of two parts. The first contains the more serious poetry of the heart and the second part more light hearted and sometimes comical poems about love. However, of special mention are &amp;ldquo;In Old Madrid&amp;rdquo; and on amore light hearted note &amp;ldquo;A Slight Surprise&amp;rdquo;. But these are not just poems for the young, for love belongs to all ages. Here we recommend &amp;ldquo;Love&amp;rsquo;s Return&amp;rdquo; about a grey haired man whose heart is bursting because he has found love again at a later stage in life; and never fear , if you have been rejected or if your heart has been broken by a love lost to another, there is a poem for you too. Here we recommend &amp;ldquo;Hard Hit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rejected&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;What It Is&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
We ask you to be aware that these poems were penned over one hundred years ago and the protocols for dating and courting in the 19th C. were vastly different to those of today. So, when reading these poems to your loved one, think Jane Austen, Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet and you&amp;rsquo;re sure to deliver the prose with all the meaning intended and with a degree of elegance missing from the current age. Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t forget the chocolates, roses and champagne, for they, with the reciting of a romantic poem are sure to win over an unsure heart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: The contents of this volume are not related to the 1920 silent movie, of a similar name, neither is it related to the 1981 novel, also of a similar name&lt;b&gt;. It is quite simply a collection of &lt;/b&gt;ninety-one enjoyable, short poems which relate to matters of the heart. Some are solemn and others more jovial in nature, and, with the exception of one or two, all are one page or less in length which makes for an easy and pleasant read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This volume has been especially produced to help raise funds for that charity of charities. So buy a copy and be assured that 10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to a worthwhile cause.&lt;br /&gt;
