  <title>Love Your Entity - Cat Devon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOMETIMES LOVE IS A MATTER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sierra Brennan can inherit her great-uncle&#39;s historic Chicago townhouse under one condition: She must live there for thirty consecutive days. What could possibly go wrong? As a writer and a ghost whisperer, Sierra has a vast imagination and a brave spirit. But not even she is prepared for the gorgeous--and naked--vampire who greets her at the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OF LIFE AND UN-DEATH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronan McCoy has spent the past century waiting to come home...to this house. The presence of the beautiful, brazen Sierra is one complication he doesn&#39;t expect. The other is Hal, a dangerous ghost and original member of Al Capone&#39;s gang who&#39;s dead-set on revenge. What is a formerly indentured vampire supposed to do to get a moment&#39;s peace? All he knows for sure is that he must protect Sierra from Hal. But once he has her in his arms, can he ever let her go? Life--and love--is becoming stranger than fiction for Sierra...and more delicious than she and Ronan could have ever imagined... in &lt;i&gt;Love Your Entity.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Like a dose of humor with your vampire romance? Cat Devon&#39;s series is for you...Sinfully delicious.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
