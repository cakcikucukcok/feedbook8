  <title>The Summer Garden (A Chesapeake Shores Novel, Book 9) - Sherryl Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;New York Times bestselling author Sherryl Woods proves once more that home is always where the heart is.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Falling for &quot;Maddening Moira&quot; O’Malley was the unexpected highlight of Luke O&#39;Brien’s Dublin holiday. So when she pays a surprise visit to Chesapeake Shores, Luke is thrilled…at first. A fling with this wild Irish rose is one thing, but forever? Maybe someday, but not when he’s totally focused on establishing a business that will prove his mettle to his overachieving family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Given Luke&#39;s reaction, Moira has some soul-searching of her own to do. Scarred by her father’s abandonment, she wonders if Luke, with his playboy past, is truly the family man she longs for. Adding to her dilemma, she&#39;s offered an amazing chance at a dream career of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deep down, though, Moira knows home is the real prize, and that love can be every bit as enchanted as a summer garden.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Woods&#39; amazing grasp of human nature and the emotions that lie deep within us make this story universal”–&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times on Driftwood Cottage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
