In our world today, filled with secular influences and pressures that seem to attempt to compromise the vitality of Gods quality will and ways, Christians need to be more fully devoted like never before, strong and steadfast, alert and uncompromising, not veering to the left or right of Gods divine path and purposes for our lives.

It is crucial in order to maintain an abundant life. Our communion and prayer dependence upon God must be heightened to its maximum stretch of devotion. Anything less would be to live far below our privilege. For ultimate results, we must remember one of the greatest promises from our LordBe thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.&lt;/p&gt;
