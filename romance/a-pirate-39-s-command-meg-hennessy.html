  <title>A Pirate&#39;s Command - Meg Hennessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;His secrets could destroy her...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Orleans, 1817&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colette Kincaid once knew such love and delicious passion in the arms of her pirate husband, Donato de la Roche. Yet Colette could not continue to live as the wife of a pirate, when reunited with her family. So she fled, taking their son with her and reconciling herself to never seeing her husband again... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until their son is taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donato is convinced his wife is behind his son&#39;s disappearance-just as she is convinced he is the villain. Now they&#39;re unable to leave each other&#39;s side as they seek their child, forced to confront the desire that still smolders between them. But Donato knows that soon he must face the secret about Colette he&#39;s been hiding for so long. And it&#39;s a secret for which there is no forgiveness...&lt;/p&gt;" />
