  <title>Son of Thunder - Libby Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rune is the grandson of Thor, and just as strong. Exiled to the realm of Earth for nearly killing his brother-it was a little misunderstanding- he has to find a way to redeem himself so he can get back to Asgard. And when he lands--literally--in the bed of a fiery redhead with an FBI badge, he realizes that she may be the key to going home. But helping Liv hunt a killer has one big consequence--chemistry. He can&#39;t keep his hands off her, and there&#39;s no way they can ever be together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years ago, FBI Special Agent Liv Winter&#39;s best friend was murdered. Since then, she&#39;s taken a two-week vacation around the anniversary of the death to try and solve the case. She&#39;s used every available resource. Yet, her friend&#39;s killer is still on the loose. She refuses to give up--willing to do almost anything to bring the person to justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, &lt;i&gt;almost anything&lt;/i&gt; includes trusting a god. And while she might need Rune&#39;s help with her case, there&#39;s no way she&#39;ll ever trust him with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
