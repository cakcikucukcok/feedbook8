  <title>Mariuccia MY DENIED LOVE - Maria Calabritto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mariuccia &amp;ldquo;My denied love&amp;rdquo; is an astonishing&amp;nbsp;and touching novel. At the centre of this novel&amp;nbsp;are Mariuccia and Antonio, two lovers from a&amp;nbsp;village in the south of Italy. They are victims of a&amp;nbsp;typical prejudicial reality of the retrograde south.&lt;br /&gt;
Mariuccia is the daughter of a modest family and&amp;nbsp;subjugated by a master father. Antonio is the son of&amp;nbsp;a highly esteemed lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;
In a hypocritical society full of thin-lipped disapproval,&amp;nbsp;Mariuccia will learn that saving appearances&amp;nbsp;is a must. In fact, at the age of fifteen, she&lt;br /&gt;
falls pregnant and gives away her baby, coerced by&amp;nbsp;her aunt whom had long emigrated to America. She&amp;nbsp;flies to New York to give birth and painfully goes&amp;nbsp;through the experience of the adoption process.&lt;br /&gt;
Her aunt persuades Mariuccia not to tell anyone&amp;nbsp;about the baby so to avoid a moral and social&amp;nbsp;scandal. Even Antonio is unaware about the fruit&amp;nbsp;of their passion love. So, his life carries on. He becomes&amp;nbsp;an engineer and travels the world on business.&lt;br /&gt;
Mariuccia is haunted by the birth of her son,&amp;nbsp;decades earlier, and his subsequent adoption. She&amp;nbsp;calls him Antonio, after his father. Her head is&amp;nbsp;full of memories: of her life in the 60s as a young&amp;nbsp;mother and a dressmaker for a living, and of the&amp;nbsp;love denied between her and Antonio, the man who&amp;nbsp;had stolen her heart.&amp;nbsp;The most remarkable thing about this novel,&amp;nbsp;full of characters and embarrassing situations, is&amp;nbsp;the humiliating-mortifying picture of a certain way&amp;nbsp;of life of a bygone era. There is also psychological&amp;nbsp;aspect of this incredible novel that is based on the&amp;nbsp;values shared by the members of a southern underdeveloped&amp;nbsp;society. In particular, the concept of&amp;nbsp;preserving virginity until marriage. That&amp;rsquo;s just how&amp;nbsp;it was back then." />
