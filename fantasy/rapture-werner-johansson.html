  <title>Rapture - Werner Johansson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The coolest kind of disability. That was how you had to consider magic. At least, it made it bearable in this time and age. All the devices and such were just not for the average wizard, as it were. It was even worse if you, up until the beginning of the summer, had planned on working with computers. It was almost as bad as to move to Alpena, whose biggest claim to fame was the snow that didnt arrive in time for Die Hard 2. What could possibly happen in a sleepy town like that?
Life is complicated enough with a twin, divorced parents, and once again, a new city. The best thing to do is to be stealthy. Avoid attention with friends who have the same agenda. If everything just would be simple, that would make for two easy years. Getting a job, some education, and then leave for some real education, learn about the other side of your life, magic. That and the rest of the world that no one talks of; its the big secret, after all.
But if things were simple and straightforward, it wouldnt be life. Whom do you love?
Magic. On paper it was powerful, mysterious, and possibly cool. In reality, it was about much of a problem as a pissed-off twin sister. The reality of it had dawned on Morgan the moment he sat down and thought about it. Never mind moving to a new town and high school. New friends dont grow on trees, so any is good, especially if they want to escape the town as badly as you do. Rose, the cute Ice Queen, seems like the perfect partner until her past surfaces.
Who knew the troubles you can get into by a kiss you werent prepared for?" />
