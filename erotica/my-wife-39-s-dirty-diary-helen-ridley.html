  <title>My Wife&#39;s Dirty Diary - Helen Ridley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Neil thought his sex life was over. His wife Lana is just as beautiful as the day they met, but after buying a house, having a kid and dealing with their jobs, the couple never have time to make love. Then Neil reads his wife&#39;s secret diary and discovers a list of unfulfilled sexual fantasies she&#39;s just dying to explore. Neil&#39;s going to save his marriage by seducing his wife all over again!
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
I started to tell the story.
I didn&#39;t start with the diary. I started at the beginning, with my regrets, my insecurities, my frustrations and fears. And then I recounted her running up the steps of City Hall and finding the diary. How I sat in the parking lot and read it cover to cover.
&quot;That&#39;s where you were?&quot; she laughed. &quot;I was so mad at you...&quot;
Her hand slid over the table. &quot;I&#39;m not thrilled that you read the whole thing,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I wrote a lot of that in the heat of the moment, stuff I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t see about you. Or me. But...&quot; Her voice broke, and I saw the shimmer in the corners of her eyes.
&quot;Oh, baby,&quot; I said. I held out my arms, leaned in, and Lana crawled into my lap and threw her arms around my shoulders.
She choked out her words, wet and warm, into my ear. &quot;I missed you!&quot; she cried. &quot;I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d ever get it back. Neil, I was so scared! I was so ashamed, and so...so angry! It&#39;s just sex, but, God...I thought you didn&#39;t want me! I thought you hated this! All of this!&quot;
I couldn&#39;t bear it. Couldn&#39;t bear the icy pain that crackled in the back of her throat. I squeezed her ears, kissed her beautiful lips, her eyes, her streaming cheeks. I wrapped her in my arms and my wife clung to me like we were miles from that kitchen table and floating in a vast, impossible ocean. We held each other afloat, oblivious to the sounds of the neighborhood or the cartoon echoing down the hall.
&quot;I love you,&quot; I whispered in her ear. &quot;You and Bill are my life, and you are the most important woman in the world.&quot; I kissed her teary eyes. &quot;And we can be everything you dreamed we could be.&quot;
&quot;Oh?&quot; she chirped. Lana eased back and wiped at her mascara. &quot;You mean, like, more open? Or do you mean, um...&quot;
I grinned. &quot;More open, yeah. But, uh, I noticed there were a few more fantasies in there. More than a few...&quot;
A devious smile opened my wife&#39;s pouting lips. &quot;Oh...?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s been a long time. I figured you&#39;d want to act out as many of those as you could.&quot;
&quot;I...&quot; Lana bit her lower lip (and even went a little red). &quot;I&#39;d like that. But, honey, really? Some of what I wrote...&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; I said. Lana gave a happy little yelp as she felt my new erection poke her thigh.
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said quietly, snuggling up against my chest. &quot;Well, in that case, do you remember that bar down on Randolph Boulevard...?&quot;
