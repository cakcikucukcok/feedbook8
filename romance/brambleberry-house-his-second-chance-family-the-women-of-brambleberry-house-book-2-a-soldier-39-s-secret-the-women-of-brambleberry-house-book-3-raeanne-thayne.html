          &lt;strong&gt;His Second-Chance Family (&lt;em&gt;The Women of Brambleberry House&lt;/em&gt;, Book 2)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Julia Blair returns to her hometown of Cannon Beach she&#39;s divorced and with two children, and ready to start over again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But is it good or bad luck when she immediately runs into her sixteen year old crush, Will Garrett who looks just as battered and bruised by life so far as she is?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;A Soldier&#39;s Secret (&lt;em&gt;The Women of Brambleberry House&lt;/em&gt;, Book 3)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To find out who was claiming ownership of the only place he&#39;d ever called home, Harry Maxwell knew he&#39;d have to practice a little deception. So the wounded lieutenant changed his name a little. Altered a few facts. All for a good cause–get in, get the truth, get out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until he met the Brambleberry House heir presumptive. Anna Galvez was captivating in ways he hadn&#39;t even known existed. Still, after spending time with her, he wanted the house more than ever.But only if she was in it….&lt;/p&gt;
