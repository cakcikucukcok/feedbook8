  <title>Blake Pierce: Mystery Bundle - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A two-book mystery bundle by #1 bestselling author Blake Pierce, author of ONCE GONE, a #1 bestseller on Amazon with over 350 five star reviews!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a bundle of the first books in two Blake Pierce series—the Riley Paige and Mackenzie White series—all here in one convenient place. This bundle offers a great introduction to Blake Pierce’s series with over 140,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BEFORE HE KILLS, a woman is found murdered in the cornfields of Nebraska, strung up on a pole, the victim of a deranged killer. It doesn’t take long for the police to realize a serial killer is on the loose—and that his spree has just begun. Detective Mackenzie White, young, tough, smarter than the aging, chauvinistic men on her local force, finds herself called in grudgingly to help solve it. As much as the other officers hate to admit it, they need her young, brilliant mind, which has already helped crack cold cases that had left them stumped. Yet even for Mackenzie this new case proves an impossible riddle, something the likes of which she—and the local force—have ever seen. With the FBI called in, together, an intense manhunt ensues. Mackenzie, reeling from her own dark past, her failed relationships, and her undeniable attraction to the new FBI agent, finds herself battling her own demons as her hunt for the killer takes her to the darkest places of her mind.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ONCE GONE, women are turning up dead in the rural outskirts of Virginia, killed in grotesque ways, and when the FBI is called in, they are stumped. A serial killer is out there, his frequency increasing, and they know there is only one agent good enough to crack this case: Special Agent Riley Paige. Riley is on paid leave herself, recovering from her encounter with her last serial killer, and, fragile as she is, the FBI is reluctant to tap her brilliant mind. Yet Riley, needing to battle her own demons, comes on board, and her hunt leads her through the disturbing subculture of doll collectors, into the homes of broken families, and into the darkest canals of the killer’s mind. As Riley peels back the layers, she realizes she is up against a killer more twisted than she could have imagined. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, BEFORE HE KILLS and ONCE GONE mark the debut of riveting new series—and beloved new characters—that will leave you turning pages late into the night. Books #2 and #3 in the Riley Paige series are also available!" />
