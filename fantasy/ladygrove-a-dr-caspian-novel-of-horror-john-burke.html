  <title>Ladygrove: A Dr. Caspian Novel of Horror - John Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The place: England; the time: the 1880s. Sir Mortimer Brobury dies suddenly, and his son David inherits his title. With his new wife Judith, he moves into Ladygrove Manor, the ancestral home. At first their lives are untroubled--until Judith falls pregnant. Suddenly there&#39;s a sinister change in the atmosphere at Ladygrove. An invisible presence prevents Judith from entering the Maze in the Manor gardens--where previously she had wandered freely. And the ruins of the old chapel seem haunted by some evil spirit. Judith becomes frightened, recalling her late father-in-law&#39;s warning not to have her first son born at Ladygrove. David calls in his friend, Dr. Alexander Caspian, the famous occult investigator. Caspian and his wife Bronwen eventually uncover a terrifying ancient mystery--but will they be in time to save Judith and her child? The third stunning entry in this great historical horror series." />
