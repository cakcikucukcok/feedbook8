  <title>Back to Earth - Danilo Clementoni, Melanie Rutter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;We were on our way back. Only one of our solar years had passed since we had been forced to leave the planet in haste, but for them, in Earth years, there had been 3,600. What would we find?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nibiru, the twelfth planet of our solar system, has an extremely elliptical and retrograde orbit, which is much larger than that of all the others. In fact, it takes approximately 3,600 years to complete one revolution around the Sun.&lt;br /&gt;
Its inhabitants, seizing the opportunities afforded by this cyclical approach, have been making systematic visits for hundreds of thousands of years, each time influencing the culture, knowledge, technology and even the very evolution of the human race. Our ancestors have referred to them in many ways, but perhaps the name that best represents them has always been &amp;ldquo;Gods&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Azakis and Petri, two friendly inhabitants of this strange planet on board the Theos spacecraft, are returning to Earth to retrieve&lt;br /&gt;
a mysterious and precious cargo left hidden during their previous visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A compelling and amusing story, but one that is full of suspense, with some potentially devastating reinterpretations of historical events.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
VOLUME 1/3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Second book: Intersection With Nibiru)&lt;br /&gt;
(Third book: The Writer)&lt;br /&gt;
