  <title>The Sacred Way of Power - Dewi Viyana Etherea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are children of the waters of life...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Sacred Way of Power I reveal certain knowledge brought with birth  obscure or hidden from most. During my life walk I retraced remaining physical threads. Mysteries of pyramids, sacred cosmology, buried history, astral knowledge and artefacts  distorted, suppressed or subverted by secret societies. This new knowledge revelation has potential to alter current systemic view of consciousness and history education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacred Way of Power glimpses a civilization lost but distantly remembered in dreaming that may have come from substantive genetic recall and customary succession. It traces concepts of Deva cosmic legacy into human society. This Mother theology survived in remnant strings to form today&#39;s Patriarchal scriptures in many religions and also customary beliefs. It is described through the reflective life story of one born into this ancient lineage and progresses personal acceptance of this great hidden truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacred Way of Power gives first insight into the way of ancient Deva Meru, subsequent chronicles describe the way of arcane Mu Triple Goddess coming to enlightened flowering. As rites of passage the Sacred Songs from Silence chronicles detail awakening into highest consciousness  incarnation pre-destined before birth, portended in cosmic heavens. This is an incarnation known in highest spiritual order, in the way emissaries locate an incarnation of Buddhist Dalai Lama. T&#39;Ara Devi Goddess ordination is only known beyond constraints of contemporary systemic society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this distant legacy has remained buried or subverted to mythology is fairly obvious. Patriarchal societies worldwide invested a lot of aggressive energy in wiping out Divine Feminine.  Several thousand successive oppressive years were described as &quot;the greatest genocide ever&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other chora the Deva light bridge was withdrawn through the veil of S&#39;ati as the Goddess submerged into the great ice melts during past ages of Leo and Cancer. The Patriarchal bull of Taurus that overran the late Post Great Flood matriarchies ensured closing of our advanced civilization. Cultural remains have been left to interpretation in child minds of generations with no real connection to arcane origins. Goddess artefacts were used and altered to suit political rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find other reasons for suppression of Mu knowledge, insights and greater secrets revealed in the chapters of The Sacred Way of Power and forthcoming series of Sacred Songs from Silence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
