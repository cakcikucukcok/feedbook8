  <title>The Dentist&#39;s Torture - Bryan Siegrist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An adventure story told in first person by a Denver dentist who becomes unintentionally involved between rogue and legitimate CIA agents. The dentist is even coerced to implant a transmitter in a patients tooth. The patient, unbeknownst to the dentist at the time, is a CIA agent who was in Iraq. Events in Iraq have lead up to the deadly conflict between the CIA agents.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is an unusual perspective involving gunfire in the dentists office in which two staff members are killed and one wounded. Others are also killed. The story takes place in Denver, Washington DC, and Lexington, KY.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The dentists dilemma is related to him being a pacifist but eventually being caught up in using deadly force.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This work is entirely fictitious and is unrelated to any person or persons, living or dead.
