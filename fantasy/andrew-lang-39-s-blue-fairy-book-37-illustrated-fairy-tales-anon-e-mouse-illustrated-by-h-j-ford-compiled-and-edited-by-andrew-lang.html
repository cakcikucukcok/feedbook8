  <title>ANDREW LANG&#39;s BLUE FAIRY BOOK - 37 Illustrated Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse,  Illustrated by H. J. Ford, Compiled and Edited by Andrew Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Blue Fairy Book you will find a set of 37 illustrated Fairy Tales collected and edited by Andrew Lang - Britain&amp;rsquo;s answer to the Grimm brothers. Within you will find perennial favourites like Hansel And Grettel, Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty And The Beast, Cinderella, Aladdin And The Wonderful Lamp and many more. You may find some are less well-known, but they equally fascinating and entertaining all the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As to whether there are really any fairies or not, is a difficult question to answer.&amp;nbsp; The Editor never saw any himself, but he knew several people who have seen them-in the Scottish Highlands - and heard their music.&amp;nbsp; So, if ever you are ever near Nether Lochaber (16km/10m south west of Fort William), be sure to go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music yourself, as grown-up people have often done. The only stipulation is that you must go on a fine day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Books Yellow, Red, and Green and Blue,&lt;br /&gt;
All true, or just as good as true,&lt;br /&gt;
And here&amp;#39;s the Blue Book just for YOU!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hard is the path from A to Z,&lt;br /&gt;
And puzzling to a curly head,&lt;br /&gt;
Yet leads to Books&amp;mdash;Green, Yellow and Red.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For every child should understand&lt;br /&gt;
That letters from the first were planned&lt;br /&gt;
To guide us into Fairy Land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So labour at your Alphabet,&lt;br /&gt;
For by that learning shall you get&lt;br /&gt;
To lands where Fairies may be met.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And going where this pathway goes,&lt;br /&gt;
You too, at last, may find, who knows?&lt;br /&gt;
The Garden of the Singing Rose.&lt;br /&gt;
