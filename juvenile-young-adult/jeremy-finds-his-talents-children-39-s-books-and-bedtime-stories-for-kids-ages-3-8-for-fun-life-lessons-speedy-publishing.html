  <title>Jeremy Finds His Talents: Children&#39;s Books and Bedtime Stories For Kids Ages 3-8 for Fun Life Lessons - Speedy Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jeremy is a giraffe and all the other animals make fun of his long neck and legs. They tease him because he looks funny when he gets a drink from the river and when he tries to lie down. He feels like an outsider because no one wants to play with him because he looks funny. He does have two best friends who don&#39;t care what the other animals say and they stick by him no matter what, but Jeremy wishes that he could be any animal other than a giraffe. One day when a pride of hyenas are trying to sneak up on the herd, Jeremy is the only one who can see them over the tall grass. When he warns everyone of the danger and they escape, the other animals realize that it isn&#39;t nice to tease someone just because they look different and Jeremy learns that no matter what, we all have our own special talent and it&#39;s always better to just be yourself." />
