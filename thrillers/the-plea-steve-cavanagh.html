  <title>The Plea - Steve Cavanagh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rip-roaring legal thriller...Twisty, bloody, and convincing.&quot; --Ian Rankin&lt;br&gt;An innocent client. A wife in jeopardy. Who will take The Plea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When billionaire David Child is arrested for the murder of his girlfriend, Clara, the FBI believes they can get him to testify and take down a huge money laundering scheme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Con-artist-turned-lawyer Eddie Flynn is given the job: persuade David to plead guilty and give the agents the evidence they need. If Eddie can&#39;t get David to take a plea bargain, the FBI has incriminating files on Eddie&#39;s wife - and will send her to jail. But David swears he didn&#39;t murder anyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence overwhelmingly shows that David killed Clara: the security video showed no one else entering their apartment, the murder weapon was in his car, and he was covered in gunshot residue he can&#39;t explain. Yet as the FBI pressures Eddie to secure the guilty plea, Eddie becomes increasingly convinced that David is telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With adversaries threatening, Eddie has to find a way to prove David&#39;s innocence and find out if there&#39;s any way he might have been framed. But the stakes are high: Eddie&#39;s wife is in danger. And not just from the FBI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plea is a locked room mystery from Steve Cavanagh, the author Nelson DeMille compares to John Grisham, Scott Turow, and Brad Meltzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Plea is one of the most purely entertaining books you&#39;ll read this year. It&#39;s a blast.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--John Connolly, bestselling author of the Charlie Parker novels&lt;/p&gt;" />
