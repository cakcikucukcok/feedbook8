  <title>A Little Something Different - Sandy Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The distinctive new crowdsourced publishing imprint Swoon Reads proudly presents its first published novel--an irresistibly sweet romance between two college students told from 14 different viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creative writing teacher, the delivery guy, the local Starbucks baristas, his best friend, her roommate, and the squirrel in the park all have one thing in common--they believe that Gabe and Lea should get together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lea and Gabe are in the same creative writing class. They get the same pop culture references, order the same Chinese food, and hang out in the same places. Unfortunately, Lea is reserved, Gabe has issues, and despite their initial mutual crush, it looks like they are never going to work things out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But somehow even when nothing is going on, &lt;u&gt;something&lt;/u&gt; is happening between them, and &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; can see it. You&#39;ll be rooting for Gabe and Lea too, in Sandy Hall&#39;s quirky, completely original novel &lt;i&gt;A Little Something Different&lt;/i&gt;, chosen by readers, writes, and publishers, to be the debut titles for the new Swoon Reads imprint!&lt;/p&gt;" />
