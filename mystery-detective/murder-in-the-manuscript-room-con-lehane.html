  <title>Murder in the Manuscript Room - Con Lehane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second in Con Lehane&#39;s 42nd Street Library mystery series, &lt;i&gt;Murder in the Manuscript Room&lt;/i&gt; is a smart, compelling mystery in which the characters themselves are at least as interesting as the striking sleuthing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Not to be missed.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Megan Abbott&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A story utterly relevant to the real-life horror story unfolding in America&#39;s immigration politics.&quot;--Sara Paretsky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a murder desecrates the somber, book-lined halls of New York City&#39;s iconic 42nd Street Library, Raymond Ambler, the library&#39;s curator of crime fiction, has a personal interest in solving the crime. His quest to solve the murder is complicated by personal entanglements involving his friend--or perhaps more-than-friend--Adele Morgan. Not only does Adele&#39;s relationship with the young woman staffer who was murdered get in the way of Ambler&#39;s investigation, more disturbing for him is Adele&#39;s growing interest in a darkly handsome Islamic scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon the Intelligence Division of the New York Police Department takes over the case from NYPD homicide detective Mike Cosgrove, Ambler&#39;s friend and sometimes partner-in-crime solving. Ambler suspects that the murder of the young woman, who&#39;d been working at the library under an assumed name and the curious intervention of NYPD&#39;s intelligence division are connected. The trail of intrigue leads to a  seemingly unrelated murder in an upstate prison and a long ago murder of a trade union reformer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one else sees the connections Ambler is sure are there--not an unusual state of affairs for Ambler. But with the city&#39;s law enforcement establishment determined to stop his investigation, the inquisitive and intrepid librarian faces challenges that may put his very life at risk.&lt;/p&gt;" />
