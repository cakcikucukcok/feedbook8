  <title>The Urban Caveman - Eve Gilmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;With allergies, health problems and obesity on the increase, the demand for a healthy but enjoyable diet has never been greater.  Although the benefits of Paleo eating are well established, the exclusion of familiar foods like grains, beans, dairy and sugar make the diet a viable option for only the most dedicated or desperate. Do you think life without bread isn&amp;#8217;t worth living?  Do you love pizza? The Urban Caveman recipe collection brings Paleo eating into the 21st century, providing recipes for guilt-free breads, cheeses and desserts &amp;#150; foods not normally associated with Paleo eating.  Rather than replicating what we imagine our Stone Age ancestors ate, Urban Caveman recipes are designed to emulate the modern diet. Over six years in development by Eve Gilmore, nutritionist and leading expert on the Paleo diet, The Urban Caveman makes Paleo eating a delicious and sustainable lifestyle choice.   So, if you want more energy, better health or need to lose weight, The Urban Caveman recipe collection may be just what you&amp;#8217;ve been looking for.  With over 300 recipes specially designed for time-short urbanites, healthy eating for you and your family has never been easier.  Giving up is NOT going without &amp;#150; you can have your cake and eat it!&lt;/div&gt;" />
