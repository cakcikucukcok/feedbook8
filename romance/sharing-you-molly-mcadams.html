  <title>Sharing You - Molly McAdams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sensational &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Molly McAdams breaks bounds with this emotionally wrenching, heartbreakingly real New Adult novel of love, passion, guilt, honor, and infidelity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three year old Kamryn Cunningham has left behind a privileged, turbulent past for the anonymity of small-town life. Busy with her new bakery, she isn&amp;#8217;t interested in hook-ups or fix-ups. Then she meets the very sexy, very married Brody. Though she can&amp;#8217;t deny the pull between them, Kamryn isn&amp;#8217;t a cheater and she&amp;#8217;s not good at sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six year old Brody Saco may be married, but he isn&amp;#8217;t happy. When his girlfriend got pregnant six years ago, he did the right thing . . . and he&amp;#8217;s been paying for it ever since. Now, his marriage is nothing but a trap filled with hate, manipulation, and blame&amp;#8212;the remnants of a tragedy that happened five years earlier. While he&amp;#8217;s never broken his vows, he can&amp;#8217;t stop the flood of emotion that meeting Kamryn unlocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brought together by an intense heat that is impossible to resist, Brody and Kamryn share stolen moments and nights that end too soon. But is their love strong enough to bear the weight of Kamryn&amp;#8217;s guilt? And is Brody strong enough to confront the pain of the past and finally break free of his conniving wife?&lt;/p&gt;" />
