  <title>Emotions in Motion - Robert L. Mir&#39;beau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do I evaluate the contents and contexts in this master piece of work? Well, in order to answer this question I will say that the first words that come to mind are: Clarity, Understanding, compassion, pity, Love, obedience and humility. One cannot stand alone without the other and that is a fact. The poems are from my heart allowing true manifestation as I allow myself to go through whatever emotions and follow through with what Tony Morrison once said A writer like myself has notes all around because as soon as an idea comes to light one must write it down fast. Diligent Behavior is about me watching a scenario unfolded at an intersection where a car accident took place while watching out of my window. Born to you I s about the imbalanced world we live in and the insanity we face day in and day out and some wish they would crawl back into mamas womb. The essays are my own interpretations and theory of these books I read. 
I write about family issues, injustices, religion, politics, not in any negative fashion just explicating myself to what I see, feel and or know guiding most of the times by some interventions and/or spiritual connections which I cannot explain just allowing the flow of intervention to manifest itself  without questioning. Most of my poems are abstract in order to allow my audience to play with words and freely express whatever it is they might want to express from own understanding. To explicate a poem it will have to do in a book tour and/or at a university speech or class to teach. I purposely include letters to friends because my primary purpose is to connect with my audiences allowing you to know more about me and show you who Im really am as well as allowing." />
