        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RANDALL HONOR&lt;/strong&gt; demanded that Jim Randall help the only woman to break his heart. Patience Anderson&#39;s child&#39;s life was at stake–so Jim swept back into her life, secreting her and her son high in the mountains to protect them from a dangerous enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RANDALL PRIDE&lt;/strong&gt; prevented Jim from giving in to his desire for Patience. As the threat neared, Jim convinced himself it was fear–not passion–that drove her into his embrace. But just as it seemed they had eluded their foe, Patience&#39;s life was threatened once more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RANDALL DESTINY&lt;/strong&gt; had been determined. And now two souls would battle the odds to form a union no evil could destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
