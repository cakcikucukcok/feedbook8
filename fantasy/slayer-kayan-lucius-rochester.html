  <title>Slayer - Kayan Lucius Rochester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In another world and time, humans and demons live in the same land, but in separate, respective realms, unable and unwilling to coexist.
Twelve years ago, demons launched war on the Human Realm in an attempt to wipe mankind out entirely and claim both realms for themselves. After many brutal battles all seemed lost for the humans, until he appeared...
A warrior emerged on the battlefield unlike any before him. With his godlike power, he crushed the invading armies and killed countless demons, forcing them back to their own land. The warrior came to be known as Draconis the Warlord, god of battle. He is a beast so terrifying, so powerful that he strikes fear even into the most bloodthirsty and battle-hardened soul. Some say he is a devil, others say he is an angel of death sent to destroy the wicked. Some even claim that he isnt real at all, only a myth. Few have ever lived after meeting the Warlord, so none can prove or disprove the mystery surrounding this enigmatic figure.
Slayer is the story of Draconis and his incredible journey after the end of the Great War. A Slayer is an elite class of mercenary and Draconis is said to be the best of them all. His journey will take him across the world and back and even into his own dark consciousness, where he constantly questions his own being: Is he actually man...or monster?
Along the way he meets friends who aid him in the numerous battles he finds himself in. There are many who reject peace and are willing to spill the blood of others for their own sinister desires. In order to make amends for the countless demons he killed in the war and to ease his restless mind, Draconis will fight these people to stop their twisted ambitions from hurting others. During his many arduous trials, will Draconis discover himself and realize who it is hes meant to be?" />
