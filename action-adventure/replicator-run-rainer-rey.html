  <title>Replicator Run - Rainer Rey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A deadly virus has broken out in Washington State. The standard procedures of quarantine and prescribed medical therapies have no effect. Victims are dying in only a few days. The same results are spreading throughout the nation, as the CDC begins to discover the terrifying truth: this virus is manmade. 	Now they must race to learn why this microbe, called a replicator, was specifically created for a human host. The replicator enters cells, kills them, duplicates, and moves on . . . to another host. And twelve cases today will be thirty thousand tomorrow--a replicator run that will put the entire United States at risk for destruction.  	Devin Parks is a reporter on the edge. Since his marriage crashed, chasing news seems pointless . . . until he realizes the devastating consequence of the outbreak. Devin soon uncovers a conspiracy that reaches from a luxurious corporate boardroom to the Sudan, from the mysteries of microbiology to an assassin&#39;s brutal expertise. 	But nothing Devin finds prepares him for the roller-coaster horror that is revealed when hopes of an antidote are dashed as nationwide vaccinations begin--the Replicator is more cunning than imagined, because in its nanotechnological genius, its cure is worse than the disease . . ." />
