  <title>Whatever Happened to Sara - Gwen Beaudean Thoma EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1953 life in Farrar, Missouri, was simple and quiet. The town of less than one hundred was composed of German immigrants who were mostly farmers. The town was centered around their Lutheran church and school. Sara Turner was a twenty-three-year-old elementary teacher at the Salem Lutheran Grade School in Farrar. She was beautiful, and she was loved by this community. She had close friends but was not lucky in romance. The heartache from her first broken romance at the age of twenty-one made Sara cynical and distrustful of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July of 1953, Sara Turner was brutally murdered on a deserted county road near Farrar. The small town was shocked to learn that their sweet and dear Sara was killed in such a way. Nothing like this had ever happened before in Farrar. Everyone knew everyone else in the community. The murderer couldnt possibly be anyone living in Farrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Barnes was the sheriff in Perry County, Missouri. He wanted to solve this case desperately. As he learned more about Sara and put the clues together, he became obsessed with the need to find justice for the young woman whose life had ended so brutally. Whatever Happened to Sara is a book that reveals not only the life of Sara Turner but also the evidences as they compiled until the case was finally solved. I hope you enjoy this book until its dramatic end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
