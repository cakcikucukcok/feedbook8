  <title>No Other Duke Will Do - Grace Burrowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this &quot;exquisite gem from a master&quot; of Regency Romance, one duke&#39;s plan to find a bride makes for a most entertaining house party (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Julian St. David, Duke of Haverford, is barely keeping his head above water in a sea of inherited debts. Though he has a long-term plan to restore the family finances, his sister has a much faster solution: host a house party for London&#39;s single young ladies and find Julian a wealthy bride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Elizabeth Windham has no interest in marriage, but a recent scandal has forced her hand. As much as she&#39;d rather be reading Shakespeare than husband-hunting, she has to admit she&#39;s impressed by Julian&#39;s protective instincts, broad shoulders, and, of course, his vast library.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As the two spend more time together, their attraction is overwhelming, unexpected... and absolutely impossible. With meddling siblings, the threat of financial ruin, and gossips lurking behind every potted palm, will they find true love or true disaster? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Smart, sexy, and oh-so-romantic.&quot; -- Mary Balogh&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Grace Burrowes is a romance treasure.&quot; -- Tessa Dare" />
