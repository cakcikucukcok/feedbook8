  <title>The Third Disestablishment - Steven K. Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1947, the Supreme Court embraced the concept of church-state separation as shorthand for the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The concept became embedded in Court&#39;s jurisprudence and remains so today. Yet separation of church and state is not just a legal construct; it is embedded in the culture. Church-state separation was a popular cultural ideal, chiefly for Protestants and secularists, long before the Supreme Court adopted it as a constitutional principle. While the Court&#39;s church-state decisions have impacted public attitudes--particularly those controversial holdings regarding prayer and Bible reading in public schools--the idea of church-state separation has remained relatively popular; recent studies indicate that approximately two-thirds of Americans support the concept, even though they disagree over how to apply it.
In the follow up to his 2010 book &lt;em&gt;The Second Disestablishment&lt;/em&gt;, Steven K. Green sets out to do examine the development of modern separationism from a legal and cultural perspective. &lt;em&gt;The Third Disestablishment &lt;/em&gt;examines the dominant religious-cultural conflicts of the 1930s-1950s between Protestants and Catholics, but it also shows how other trends and controversies during mid-century impacted both judicial and popular attitudes toward church-state separation: the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses&#39; cases of the late-30s and early-40&#39;s, Cold War anti-communism, the religious revival and the rise of civil religion, the advent of ecumenism, and the presidential campaign of 1960. The book then examines how events of the 1960s-the school prayer decisions, the reforms of Vatican II, and the enactment of comprehensive federal education legislation providing assistance to religious schools-produced a rupture in the Protestant consensus over church-state separation, causing both evangelicals and religious progressives to rethink their commitment to that principle. Green concludes by examining a series of church-state cases in the late-60s and early-70s where the justices applied notions of church-state separation at the same time they were reevaluating that concept." />
