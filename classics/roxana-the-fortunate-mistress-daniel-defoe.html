  <title>Roxana, The Fortunate Mistress - Daniel Defoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daniel Defoe&#39;s last novel &quot;Roxana&quot; is perhaps his darkest. Using his &quot;fallen woman&quot; archetype established in his seminal work &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, Defoe tracks the mercurial life of an unnamed female protagonist who adopts the pseudonym Roxana. The story of her rise and fall is a captivating account of the destructive powers of greed and seduction. Roxana begins as a deserted wife with five children. She chooses a life of prostitution for sustenance, and discovers opportunity to climb the social and economic ranks. Quickly Roxana finds herself deeply immersed in a life of excess and vice. She swings from powerful suitor to suitor, acquiring fortunes from each. Her sexual exploits transform her into a self-empowered economically independent social climber. Yet this liberated life comes with its prices. Defoe&#39;s &quot;Roxana&quot; is a bold and powerful narrative—one that begs for an inquiry into the role of sex and power in a capitalistic society. An engrossing novel, &quot;Roxana&quot; remains a classic of English letters and one of Defoe&#39;s finest." />
