  <title>Her Last Wild Ride - Abby Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Some guys know just what a girl needs…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fresh off a brutal break-up—with a guy who was running for the World&#39;s Biggest Liar—Ashling Sullivan has returned to New York City to start over. Priority number one is getting her new business started with her BFF, Jenna. Hence their strict no-guys pact. No dating, no sex, no exceptions! Until temptation walks into her brother&#39;s bar in the form of a really, really hot guy!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She must resist. She will resist. Except that Johnny Ryan, with his cool, edgy but brooding attitude (what is it with this guy?) and his so, so strong carpenter&#39;s hands, is six-foot-three inches of ripped, Irish sexiness that turns Ash into a puddle of lust in about half a second. Worse yet, he offers her a deal that she can&#39;t refuse?a down-&#39;n&#39;-dirty and wickedly hot two-week fling. Just one last ride before she gets down to business. No-one would know! Ash is definitely not thinking with her head or her heart when she agrees…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because this thing with Johnny goes way deeper than just chemistry. And what started as a last, wild ride with a bad boy is definitely headed for major head-on collision…&lt;/p&gt;
