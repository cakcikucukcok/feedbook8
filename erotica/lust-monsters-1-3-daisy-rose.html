Excerpt From Lust &amp;amp; Monsters 3:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a full week before I decided that I was never leaving the apartment if I waited for the love bites on my body to fade. Dante was doing it on purpose, leaving his marks on my skin on places that couldn&amp;#39;t be easily hidden so people would know that I was his.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We should introduce ourselves to the neighbors,&amp;quot; I declared, having made up my mind only an hour before the dinner party. I was no longer walking with a limp and I was eager for some fresh air. &amp;quot;Have you filled in the forms for the apartment?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded absently from the door, leaning against it as he had done for the past half an hour, just staring. I had gotten used to the way he looked at me as if he was ready to swallow me whole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I closed the laptop and dangled my feet off the bed. The sun was barely starting to set but Dante looked like he was ready to call it a day already when he walked towards me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dante! I&amp;#39;m serious,&amp;quot; I said, pulling away when he pinned me to the bed with his arms on my shoulders, pushing me back down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; he asked, kissing the nape of my neck. I moaned when I felt him suck the small, bruised skin into his mouth to reaffirm his mark.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dante, at this rate I&amp;#39;ll be black and blue all over,&amp;quot; I whispered, my hands tightening on his arms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Beautiful,&amp;quot; he breathed as he kissed down the dip of my collar, pushing the buttoned blouse aside so he could burrow his face further down my breasts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dante, I wanna meet the neighbors later!&amp;quot; I gasped, pushing him away seriously. He looked slightly hurt, but nodded with a light smile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Fine,&amp;quot; he said, pulling me to my feet but keeping his arms around my waist. &amp;quot;But we will continue this after,&amp;quot; he promised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gulped and nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My eyes widened when I saw how his form changed from the horned demon to a perfectly ordinary human male, his skin tone turning creamier, more alive. He was still incredibly sexy. &amp;quot;I prefer you with horns,&amp;quot; I said out loud, then blushed when I realized what I had done.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grinned. &amp;quot;I prefer you naked.&amp;quot;" />
