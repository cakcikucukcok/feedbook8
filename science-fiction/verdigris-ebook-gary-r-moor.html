  <title>Verdigris Ebook - Gary R. Moor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lillith Adams, bronze sculptor and ex-marine, has the opportunity of a lifetime: creating a monument to St. Francis of Assisi for the Archdiocese of New York. She has also obligated herself for the past seven years to taking care of her tenants in the renovated century-old building she lives in and owns. She is certain none of them could make it without her help. Dealing with their problems threatens failure, which would destroy her reputation as an artist and bankrupt her. However, her life and that of all human beings takes a decisive turn when a crate is delivered to her studio. Rather than the clay she ordered from Prague, a sarcophagus lies within. When the being inside emerges from a two millennium sleep, Lillith discovers it will grant her any wish she desires. But inadvertently her wish will end civilization as we know it, for this is no genie, it is more the Golem of Hebrew legend. It will fulfill her wish completely to the letter, no matter what it takes, or at what cost." />
