  <title>The Will to Power - Friedrich Nietzsche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What I am now going to relate is the history of the next two centuries. I shall describe what will happen, what must necessarily happen: the triumph of Nihilism. This history can be written already; for necessity itself is at work in bringing it about.

The whole of our culture in Europe has long been writhing in an agony of suspense which increases from decade to decade as if in expectation of a catastrophe: restless, violent, helter-skelter, like a torrent that will reach its bourne, and refuses to reflect—yea, that even dreads reflection." />

It is best understood as an irrational force, found in all individuals, that can be channeled toward different ends.<br /><b><i>Nietzsche's Concept of the Will to Power - ThoughtCo</i></b> | The will to power (German: der Wille zur Macht) is a prominent concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. The will to power describes what Nietzsche may have believed to be the main driving force in humans. However, the concept was never systematically defined in Nietzsche's work, leaving its interpretation open to debate.<br /><b><i>Will to power - Wikipedia</i></b> | Assembled by Nietzsche’s sister after his death, The Will to Power is a collection of the philosopher’s reflections and theories taken from his unpublished notebooks. Covering topics such as nihilism, Christianity, morality, and the famous “will to power,” the book was controversially presented as Nietzsche’s all-but-completed magnum opus containing his philosophical system.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Will to Power - Friedrich Nietzsche</a> </h3></p><hr/>
