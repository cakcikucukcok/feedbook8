Some poems writing are intended for the heart&#39;s lifter in &quot;New York, An Awesome City&quot;; devotion, &quot;A Love So Great&quot;; inspirational in &quot;Behold&quot;; confession of a great love and/or true love; &quot;My Dearly Beloved&quot; and many others. Poems that are of grouching regrets,&quot;Let Me Go&quot;;  melancholic in, &quot;Lonely Newport Beach&quot;, melodramatic in &quot;Life of a Snail&quot; and even poignant scene like the &quot;Agony of War&quot; plus many others.
