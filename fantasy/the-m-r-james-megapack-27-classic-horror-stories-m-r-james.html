  <title>The M.R. James Megapack: 27 Classic Horror Stories - M.R. James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Montague Rhodes James (1862 - 1936), who wrote as M. R. James, was an English medieval scholar and provost of King&#39;s College, Cambridge (1905-1918), and of Eton College (1918-1936). He is best remembered for his ghost stories, which are regarded as among the best in the genre. James redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic cliches of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, James&#39;s protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the &quot;antiquarian ghost story.&quot; &lt;P&gt; This volume collects 27 of his classic tales, including: &lt;P&gt; CANON ALBERIC&#39;S SCRAP-BOOK&lt;BR&gt; LOST HEARTS&lt;BR&gt; THE MEZZOTINT&lt;BR&gt; THE ASH-TREE&lt;BR&gt; NUMBER 13&lt;BR&gt; COUNT MAGNUS&lt;BR&gt; QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT&lt;BR&gt; THE TREASURE OF ABBOT THOMAS&lt;BR&gt; PART 2: THE FIVE JARS&lt;BR&gt; THE DISCOVERY&lt;BR&gt; THE FIRST JAR&lt;BR&gt; THE SECOND JAR&lt;BR&gt; THE SMALL PEOPLE&lt;BR&gt; DANGER TO THE JARS&lt;BR&gt; THE CAT, WAG, SLIM AND OTHERS&lt;BR&gt; THE BAT-BALL&lt;BR&gt; WAG AT HOME&lt;BR&gt; PART 3: MORE GHOST STORIES OF AN ANTIQUARY&lt;BR&gt; CASTING THE RUNES&lt;BR&gt; THE ROSE GARDEN&lt;BR&gt; THE TRACTATE MIDDOTH&lt;BR&gt; THE STALLS OF BARCHESTER CATHEDRAL&lt;BR&gt; MARTIN&#39;S CLOSE&lt;BR&gt; MR HUMPHREYS AND HIS INHERITANCE&lt;BR&gt; PART 4: A THIN GHOST AND OTHERS&lt;BR&gt; THE RESIDENCE AT WHITMINSTER&lt;BR&gt; THE DIARY OF MR.
