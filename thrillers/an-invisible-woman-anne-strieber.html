  <title>An Invisible Woman - Anne Strieber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kealy Ryerson has everything a New York socialite could want: wealth, power, a devoted husband and loving children. She was at the salon, getting her hair done,  when her cell phone rang and her life changed forever.  It was her husband, a high-profile defense lawyer.   &lt;i&gt;Run!&lt;/i&gt; he said. &lt;i&gt;Take the children and get out of the country.  Go now.  Trust no one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a half hour he was dead, shot down in the street as he left lunch with the district attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kealy cannot run.  Her apartment is under surveillance, and she can&#39;t get her passport or any money. Her credit cards have been cancelled.  She&#39;s wanted by the police.   She and her teen-age kids are on their own, on  the streets, with only her wits to keep them alive - her wits, and some surprising new friends.   Kealy is determined to discover who has done this to her and her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She discovers that she has a invisible advantage--because without her fancy clothes and expensive make-up, her jewels and her hair stylist, no one recognizes her.   Not the police, not her husband&#39;s partner, not her best friends.   A poor woman of a certain age is someone that no one really looks at.  But she can watch them.  She can follow them. She can use their blindness against them, and walk invisible among the people who want her dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
