      <meta name="description" content="And the Lord God made Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them, Then the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for eve? therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,... he placed afiaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book I, Garments of Skin,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; biotechnology had enabled man to slip past the flaming sword. He has broken through to the Tree of Life and eaten of its fruit. But now the soul in trapped in the garment of skin, and this curse brought about by the hubris of science is poised to spread like a plague throughout all humanity." />
