  <title>The Lonely Ones Among Us - Oluwole Komolafe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lonely Ones Among Us describes the arduous and slippery paths of the selected few that journey to success from the base of the economic pyramid of life in Nigeria. In this book, the author draws similarities between the capillary action in a rising damp to the determination that propels the poor that rise from the base of the economic pyramid to success by dint of hard work.
Mr. Enilari Olakitan Ekun, a humble science teacher in a secondary school in Lagos, is the main character in the book. His life exemplifies the challenges faced by the few that swim against the tide to liberate themselves from the bondage at the base of the economic pyramid. Other characters with similar attributes to Mr. Ekun are identified in the book. What they all have in common is that they refuse to follow the accepted way of life that the society considers to be the norm. They are the aberrant that see the problems others overlook or pretend not to see. Instead of following the crowd, they choose to follow the road of the lone wayfarer. In summary, the book shows that the old fashion way of hard work still pays off." />
