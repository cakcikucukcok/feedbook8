          &lt;strong&gt;From tomboy to bombshell?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Captain Jim Kelley is thunderstruck. Suddenly Alexandra Mendez has gone from one of the guys, kid sister and tomboy to all woman. Alex is under his command on a dangerous undercover mission, but Jim has to keep reminding himself they’re only pretending to be lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alex has loved Jim all her life, but they’d always been just friends. Now working together to thwart an assassination plot, their cover requires her to unearth her femininity. Jim’s sudden attention is unexpected…and thrilling. But is Jim just infatuated by her looks, or is it her he wants?&lt;/p&gt;
