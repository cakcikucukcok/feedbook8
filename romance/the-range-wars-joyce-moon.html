  <title>The Range Wars - Joyce Moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A dangerous, wild, and lawless country where men and women had to learn the law of survival Range wars over grazing lands and water rights were a real test on a persons strength
Yet one woman had the courage to fight for the better; from a lonely girl to a faith-filled lady, she had the strength
Julliannyia Hamperston went wild with excitement when her boyfriend called her out west She couldnt be more surprised than disappointed when she became involved in a range war after finding out that her parents left her some land; very valuable land. When she meets Keith Petershire, she is torn between her desire to be her own woman and a woman in love. Julli wonders if her strength is enough to endure the savage land and win her the war. Will her newly acquired faith win her the heart of the man she loves?" />
