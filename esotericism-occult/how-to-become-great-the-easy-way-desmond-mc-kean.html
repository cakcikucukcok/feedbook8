  <title>How to Become Great the Easy Way - Desmond Mc Kean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For eons, men have sought greatness, yet very few ever reach such a historical status or fame. Yet there is a way to surpass even these ones. A prime example of such a status is Confucius. Confucius is known worldwide. Yet when he was alive, not too many took him seriously. He had a plan to create better conditions in China, but the princes and rulers did not view him as royalty, so his dream of improving the land did not come about in his lifetime. Yet Confucius had some followers and wrote many wise sayings or proverbs. It wasnt until after his death that he became world-renowned. That is the kind of greatness this book will help you achieveguaranteed! It is a virtual blueprint in making the reader into the smartest or wisest man who ever lived and is a compass and map leading to the highest position of authority on earth. Just as surely as a father is more complex than his son (for children cannot understand complex ideals like E = MC2), this book will lead you to being smarter or wiser than around you." />
