  <title>One-Moment Meditation - Martin Psy.D. Boroson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Think of all the moments you &amp;quot;lose&amp;quot;: stuck in traffic, standing in line, waiting for a download. And think of all the moments you &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot;: working when you&amp;#39;re not focused, or fiddling with your phone. What if each of these moments offered you an extraordinary opportunity? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In One-Moment Meditation, now published in eight languages, Martin Boroson distills the philosophy of time into a simple form of meditation that you can do anywhere, anytime. It begins with an exercise that takes just one minute per day. With practice, this takes less and less time, until it only takes a moment. Then each and every moment gives you a chance to reduce stress, refresh your mind, and open yourself to new possibilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unique approach to meditation was featured as a thirty-day series for stress reduction on Oprah.com. Playful, profound, and above all, practical, One-Moment Meditation teaches you that inner peace is not a distant goal reserved for saints and sages, and it doesn&amp;#39;t take a lot of time: it only takes a moment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s hard to overestimate how helpful this technique could be.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Psychologies magazine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This gem of a book is a marvelous launching pad for anyone who wants to rest in the now, the only time there is.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Larry Dossey, M.D., author of Reinventing Medicine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Martin Boroson&amp;#39;s fantastic book ... is all about learning to condense the practice of meditation into these fleeting moments. And about how, from a certain perspective, a sequence of fleeting moments are all we ever really have anyway.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Oliver Burkeman, The Guardian" />
