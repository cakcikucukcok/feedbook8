With her new friends from Broomstick, Cyndi, Mindy, and Wendy McDermit along with April and May Mnter, they all go on an adventure of a lifetime simply by letting Katee Greene open a crypt door after dark on November eighteenth, better known as Occult day.
When Agnes and Harriet went looking for answers of who Katee Greene is, they find Katees father Wesley willing to help.
Is this some kind of Halloween prank you are trying to pull? Ive read about the crazy goings on in that weird town, witches and wizards supposedly doing magic. What a bunch of rubbish. Get away from my house, yelled Wesley Greene as he slammed the door shut on Agnes almost catching her fingers in the door jam.
Rubbish he says. Crazy goings on says he. Pulling Halloween pranks are we? Now its my turn to talk to him, said Harriet as she twirled her right index finger and disappeared into the house." />
