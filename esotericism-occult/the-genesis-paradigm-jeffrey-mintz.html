  <title>The Genesis Paradigm - Jeffrey Mintz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for anyone who is searching and aware that life is a journey and looking for ways to better understand the endless possibilities and challenges involved in that process. The Genesis Paradigm comes from a unique perspective the author has developed where the idea is essentially that we are all capable of living our lives to a far greater potential than we do. However to achieve our potential, we need to develop our inherently creative selves. We need to develop our imaginations to allow ourselves to tap into our higher selves. As our world becomes satiated with material wealth and prosperity, people are searching for more. They are aware on some level of this latent potential. 
This book is relevant to anyone interested in change. There are many transitions and challenges for people everywhere right now, but none more than the baby boomer generation who are now entering a new phase of their lives. With the changing economy, many are not able to retire as  they had planned. There are many who are going through health challenges, divorce, redefining themselves as many begin new careers and hobbies. There is an explosion of technology and the world is changing rapidly as never before. Many people are facing the need to change and adapt. Many are struggling. This is a unique perspective from a professional therapist, and someone who has lived a spiritual life for the past 25 years. There are many ideas contained in this book that are of universal interest to many readers." />
