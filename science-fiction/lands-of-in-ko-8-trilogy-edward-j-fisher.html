  <title>Lands of In-Ko-8 Trilogy - Edward J. Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lands of In-Ko-8 Trilogy
The planet Earth enveloped Inchoate, a dark-matter world at the birth of the solar system. Each evolved separately but not independently. The civilizations of Inchoate flourished until a disaster flung the world to the Sirius star system where it remained for a millennium. Scientists finally restored Inchoate to its rightful place in the galaxy, but the resulting damage, chaos, and greed led to conflict, confusion, and wars. A few brave leaders of the blue, green, and gray people almost brought order when a totally unexpected visit by star wanderers intervened.
A review by Kirkus Discoveries:
Fishers complex story of faith, political schemes, death, and science brings characters new and old into the fray, and further explores characters in the strange world of Inchoate. The world of Inchoate is on the brink of disaster, leading scientists to return the dark-matter planet to its former haunt within the planet Earth. The task is made possible via the ingenious travalink, a device that allows near-light transport from one part of the universe to the other. The planets inhabitants are no sooner settled in to their old home, however, before unearthing a finding of great political and religious significanceone that threatens to shake the planet to its core. Fishers keen grasp of science helps create a believable, full-bodied civilization. The lands and characters resemble an odd marriage of J. R. R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings saga and the more recent Dune novels. The authors descriptions of the various languages of Inchoate, and the background of various civilizations, are reminiscent of Tolkiens seminal work. His characters range from religious leaders to criminals, and like the Dune characters, each gets print time in this tale. Inchoate is a land with a varied, rich history, culled from seemingly real-life examples. The authors sharp attention to detail, in elements from language to food, brings an original sense of realism to the talesometimes it appears more of history book than fiction.
A condensed, fast-paced story, whose entertaining intensity will eventually sweep readers away." />
