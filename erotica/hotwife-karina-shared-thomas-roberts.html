~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was my wife, I loved her. Even though we had our arrangement&amp;#39; and I&amp;#39;d given her permission to do whatever she wanted, that didn&amp;#39;t mean it wasn&amp;#39;t going to hurt me. My fear was she&amp;#39;d leave me for him, and I&amp;#39;d lose the best thing I ever had, and still, I was so excited, I knew I had to do something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without leaving the chair I&amp;#39;d been told to stay in, I slipped my pants off and released myself. I was ashamed of how much smaller and powerless I was even as my wife cried from the bedroom. Putting my hands on the arms of the chair, I raised myself enough to see he had entered her. Marshall was using my wife. She had her hands above her head, her legs spread, her knees bent, and was grunting with each stroke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was quivering with excitement caused by the humiliation of being told to sit in a chair, allowed to only listen to what another man was doing to my wife. The delicious humiliation clashed with the mad love I felt for Karina and the insane resentment I felt toward the man I was sharing her body with. I savored the rush as I might a fine wine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My arms grew tired as I tried to watch what I could. He first pounded hard inside her, then stopped all movement and held still as she passionately kissed him, talking to him between kisses. I wished I knew what she was saying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every noise my wife made went through my body, causing my manhood to jump. My heart was beating rapidly. At first, I thought he was hurting herif he was, the pain turned to pleasure quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sank back into my chair, touching myself and thinking about what I had seen. Marshall was not only older and in an entirely different class from us, he was so much larger than my wife, and he was using her body just yards away from me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was distracted from my ruminations when she began to squeal. It was familiar but different. Her squeal was louder and more highly pitched than I&amp;#39;d heard before. He finished inside my wife, grunting, with Karina urging him on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I went to the in-suite bar to fix a drink, but my hands were shaking too much to pour. I looked at them stupidly until my wife groaned, and I returned to my chair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His stamina was amazing. He used my wife again before they cuddled together, talking softly. I decided to take a nap in the large beige chair. I woke briefly to the sound of my wife squealing again from the bedroom. The light was low, but I could see well enough to know she was on top, moving fast against him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I woke again with a start, still in the comfortable chair. The lights in the bedroom were off, but the lamps in the large living room where on, and I could clearly see a naked Karina just inside the doorway, looking out at me. When she saw I was awake, she held her finger over her mouth in the universal be quiet&amp;#39; sign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She looked over her shoulder to make sure Marshall was sleeping. When she was certain he was out, she turned her back to me and bent over to look at me from between her spread legs. As interesting as it was to see my wife&amp;#39;s face appear between her knees, what caught my attention was how swollen she was. She was spread wide, something white was leaking down her thigh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Karina smiled even more broadly at the expression on my face. After straightening, she turned and held her hands a foot apart and mouthed the word, wow&amp;#39; before disappearing into the darkness of the bedroom, pretending to walk bowlegged." />
