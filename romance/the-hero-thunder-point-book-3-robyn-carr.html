  <title>The Hero (Thunder Point, Book 3) - Robyn Carr</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The Thunder Point series&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The Hero - Book 3&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;With warmth and sensitivity, #1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr shows readers that falling in love can be the bravest act of all.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a moment of desperation, Devon McAllister takes her daughter and flees a place where they should have been safe and secure. She has no idea what is around the next bend, but she is pretty certain it can&#39;t be worse than what they&#39;ve left behind. Her plan is to escape to somewhere she can be invisible. Instead, an unexpected offer of assistance leads her to Thunder Point, a tiny Oregon town with a willingness to help someone in need.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the widowed father of a vulnerable young boy, Spencer Lawson knows something about needing friendship. But he&#39;s not looking for anything else. Instead, he&#39;s thrown his energy into his new role as Thunder Point&#39;s high school football coach. Tough and demanding to his team, off the field he&#39;s gentle and kind…just the kind of man who could heal Devon&#39;s wounded heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devon thought she wanted to hide from the world. But in Thunder Point, you find bravery where you least expect it…and sometimes, you find a hero…&lt;/p&gt;
