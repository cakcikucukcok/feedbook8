  <title>Dating God - Jocelynn M. Burton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you found yourself in a place of waiting? Are you wondering what you are waiting for? Well thats where I found myself just a few years ago. God showed me not only what I was waiting for, but Who I was waiting for too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for all of you who are confused, frustrated, broken and tired. Id like to give you some hope. And show you a new way of thinking. What started as a fun guide for a friend became so much more. Its a story of God from another perspective. Its how God showed Himself to me, in a way I could understand. And now Im on a mission to help others understand God in their own language. Some people are book learners, others need visuals. God understood me and knew what I needed to understand Him, and Im going to tell you how He did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a promise made to God, He handed me a spiritual compass and all He said was to go where it leads. Inside youll find where it has taken me so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont let a broken relationship, bad family experience, horrible work environment, or anything else you can think of keep you from getting to know God better. Let God use your life to teach you about His love. Dont believe its possible? Well, inside this book Ill prove that wrong. So go ahead, try to prove otherwise, I DARE you. ;)&lt;/p&gt;" />
