  <title>Albert&#39;s Ark - Fred Crampton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2014, ex marine and mercenary Albert Crowther has a vision to set up a floating island: a modern day Ark! He said he had had enough of those political fat cat bastards with their taxes, rules and regulation! He was sick of ever increasing violence, shootings, stabbings, drug and alcohol abuse on Britains streets. He convinced his long suffering wife Amy that they needed to get of the planet, set up a group of like minded people and start a new life away from the corruption of modern day living. Relationships developed on the Ark with friendships, love and romance, affairs, steamy sex, marital problems and friction. Daily life was peppered with humour; drama; births, deaths and marriages; celebrations and surprises. 
The dream was to live the good life on the Ark. Little did the community know at the start of their new life together how elusive Utopia would be. The characters from different backgrounds, status and gender live together in close proximity, interacting in a multicultural melting pot, but seem unable to escape from corruption of external influence and attack, let alone the unpredictability of the weather and human nature. 
But ever the optimist, as Albert often remarked You never know whats over the horizon." />
