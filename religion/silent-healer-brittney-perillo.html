  <title>Silent Healer - Brittney Perillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 61 clearly talks about Gods desire for us. He has come to heal the broken hearted, proclaim liberty to the captives and to set the bound free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often get consumed and emotionally damaged by all of the pain that has hit our lives. We tend to run to different things to fulfill us and make us whole in God, when all we really need is God himself. God wants us to heal emotionally in him and live freely in His presence. He loves us, and desires for us to intimately know him. Come on a journey with Brittney Perillo as she unravels what healing in God can look like from many perspectives, but all yielding the same result, wholeness in Him. There will be stories of women from the Bible as well as stories from modern day women that have been hurt and lost in their own pain or pain caused by others and found healing in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will change your life through this book. Seek Gods face all the way to your own personal healing journey with Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
