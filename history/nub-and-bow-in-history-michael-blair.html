  <title>Nub and Bow in History - Michael Blair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nub was my dad. His name was Lawrence. He is on the right. His brother Theodore is on the left. This picture was taken about 1948. Most of this book was put together to make fiction. This book is about two boys that were brothers growing up about 1910. It has a lot of history, religion and a cook book at the end. 
Dad gave people nick names, mine was Bow, You pronounce it like Bow in (Bow and Arrows). Lots of names in which were used have been changed, like Bow for my uncle. The picture on the left of the back is of Earl Hamner and I. There isn&#39;t and drugs, killing, bed hopping or bad language in it. My other book that are out are (Nub and Bow) and (Between the Tracks)." />
