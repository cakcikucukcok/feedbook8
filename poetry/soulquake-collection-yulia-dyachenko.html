  <title>Soulquake Collection - Yulia Dyachenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Soulquake Collection is a book of poems with character and a unique alternative style of poetry structuring. The abstract artwork inside is shown in black and white in order to allow the readers to make their own assumptions as to which poem compliments the paintings and drawing inside without colors influencing predetermined notions in regard to meaning of colors and the emotions they evoke. This book is designed to ensure that your feelings about the words inside and what they represent to you are authentic and yours alone. 
Here is something to help you understand the tittle and content of this collection. The definition of earthquake, as per dictionary.com, is a series of vibrations induced in the earths crust by the abrupt rupture and rebound of rocks in which elastic strain has been slowly accumulating. Or something that is severely disruptive; upheaval.
The definition of soulquake is a disturbance of ones inner equilibrium and feeling of peace, stemming from some kind of internal imbalance, usually induced through heartbreak, betrayal, a disorder, self-sabotage, negative self-talk, or low self-esteem. These cracks in the soul can be self-inflicted or caused by someone we love or, perhaps, once loved.
The buildup of cracks in your soul similar to earthquakes is a result of slowly accumulating unresolved internal emotional turmoil, or a collection of soulquakes. 
Although this collection of poetry deals with a variety of subjects that lean toward the dark side, so to speak, the fun and unusual poetry structuring and original artwork creates a sort of balance, shifting your soul in the right direction and, hopefully, your souls personal, internal equilibrium." />
