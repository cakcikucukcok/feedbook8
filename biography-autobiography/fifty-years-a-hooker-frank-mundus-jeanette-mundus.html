  <title>Fifty Years a Hooker - Frank Mundus, Jeanette Mundus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stories in &lt;i&gt;Fifty Years a Hooker&lt;/i&gt; range from dramatic, nerve-pounding accounts of shark hunts to tales of comic misadventures, involving a host of eccentric characters who could not resist the pull of Frank Mundus legendary &quot;idiot magnet&quot;. Mundus extensive compilation accurately reflects the books title. He was, indeed, a hooker. For fifty years he sold his services, took good care of his customers and saw to it that they had a good time, hoping that they went away satisfied and would come back again.
&lt;p&gt;Among the stories youll find in &lt;i&gt;Fifty Years a Hooker&lt;/i&gt; are:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;White Shark, White Pineapple.&lt;/b&gt; The agony of waiting for the right writer.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How I Got Started Shark Fishing.&lt;/b&gt; How a broken arm and two train wrecks kept me on the  right track for a fishing career.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Pelican&lt;/i&gt; Disaster.&lt;/b&gt; My involvement in one of the worst maritime disasters off Long Island.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harry Hoffman and the Case of the Lost White Shark.&lt;/b&gt; The zany fishing misadventures of my friend, Harry Hoffman, and me.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 4,500 lb. White Shark.&lt;/b&gt; My mate, my customers and I fight one of the largest whites ever taken commercially by harpoon.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Gimbel.&lt;/b&gt; The first man who swam with sharks, while I rode shotgun. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Close Calls.&lt;/b&gt; The time an ice-cream cone saved my life, plus other close calls.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tap-Tap.&lt;/b&gt; The time I hollered at Jackie Onassis for jay-walking on the island of St. Maarten. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The St. Maarten Sting: Or, How I Sold the &lt;i&gt;Cricket III&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Borrowing a storyline from the movie &lt;i&gt;The Sting&lt;/i&gt;, I sell my other boat and outsmart a couple of Caribbean pirates.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portrait of the Artist as an Idiot.&lt;/b&gt; A mysterious artist (who lost the Mayor of Shelter Islands bust!) claims me as his muse for a watercolor of a white shark.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mundus of Arabia.&lt;/b&gt; A Saudi Prince hires me to pioneer shark fishing in the Red Sea. I   just miss a public beheading and narrowly escape one year in jail. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 3,427-lb White Shark.&lt;/b&gt;  In 1986 I achieve my lifetime ambition of catching the largest fish of any kind on rod and reel, with the help of some seasoned mates and an experienced angler.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pistol-Whipped by the Law.&lt;/b&gt; A mates dog and his ex-wife set off a chain reaction which culminates in my arrest for possession of a firearm.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three-time Loser, Fourth-time Winner.&lt;/b&gt; The two happiest times in a mans life are when he buys a boat and sells it . . . and sells it and sells it, and hopefully sells it again, like I did!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting to the Heart of Things.&lt;/b&gt; I remarry, burn my snow shoes and retire to Hawaii, where  I plant pineapples and fruit trees, adopt a orphaned 350 lb. wild boar, and survive open-heart surgery, aneurysm repair and prostate cancer.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My South African Shark Safari.&lt;/b&gt; In which I travel to South Africa with the Discovery Channel and hook up with white sharks once morethis time through the lens of a camera." />
