  <title>The Education of Innocence - Sophia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Authors Note
By looking into The Book of Life, Humanitys Soul Records, Sophia witnessed that Souls began their sacred journey in a fall from grace that shattered their innocence and caused a splintering of the personality. In four simple words, Sophia came to understand the Souls raison dtre for existence--it is for The Education of Innocence.
That secret has been well hidden within great Mysteries coveted by ancients in the sacred Temples of old. But why was that secret hidden? What does that secret reveal about the true essence of our nature? Once that true essence is known, how could that awareness bring knowledge that could change our lives? In essence, what does innocence have to do with Divine power?
The Education of Innocence portrays the archetypal story that rings true for every incarnated Soul. The stages of a Souls sacred journey are metaphorically portrayed, revealing the fall that had devastating consequences upon humanitys collective psyche, and what now compels an awakening in global consciousness critical for survival.
When innocence became shattered, a shadow rose in place of light. Without understanding the shadow, one can never transcend illusions. Without transcending illusions, the admonition (deliberate use) in the bible, Ye are Gods, can never be known again. The Master awaits.
Book II opens in the Underworld of Darkness where a Dark Lord is reminiscing about events that shaped his brutal character, accountable for his splintered Soul. Striving to fulfill the Black Oracle to claim dominion over the Empire of Darkness, he must overcome impossible odds.
Little Sol awakens to his destiny, with Initiations of remembrance guided by the Wizard Domaine. A whole host of sea creatures portraying Shadow and Light clash during the Apocalyptic times of The Final Reckoning. With the outcome unknown, the Immortals of the Original Ancestry of the Gods must come into remembrance if the Kingdom of Oceana is to be rescued from its terrifying fate." />
