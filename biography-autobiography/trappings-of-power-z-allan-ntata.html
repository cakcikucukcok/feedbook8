  <title>Trappings of Power - Z Allan Ntata</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why is it that by his death, having solved the countrys hunger problems and set an example for Africa on how to deal with foreign donors and international aid organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank, Mutharika was regarded as a pariah both in Malawi and internationally? Mutharika had overseen the expansion of the transport infrastructure, presided as Chairman of the African Union and helped Malawi achieve rapid GDP growth. How is it that he also left Malawi with serious economic problems particularly relating to nonexistent foreign exchange reserves and the inability of the country to import fuel? Why is it that that when he died, he had become the most hated man in Malawi, at least aside from his staunch party followers?
This book analyses the presidency of Bingu wa Mutharika from the inside, his love-hate relationship with foreign donors and international aid agencies and his political successes and failures to show how power and political success in Africa is a trap that ensnares African leaders to easily forget their mission to serve the people. The role of patronage and culture, and the tendency of advisors in contributing to their leaders feelings of infallibility is also highlighted. The book uncovers lessons on the inner dynamics of power and politics in Africa that will be enlightening to all interested in African politics specifically, and third world political development in general." />
