  <title>The Heartbeat of Intelligence - Elaine Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Evolving Heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature&#39;s Astonishing Evolutionary Intention for Humanity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Heartbeat of Intelligence&lt;/I&gt; shows why we are not fulfilling our potential, as individuals and as a species. It shows how and why we stepped off the evolutionary path intended by Nature, a path which would have put us several evolutionary steps ahead of where we are now had we not strayed from it. The book shows how stepping off the path has severely jeopardized the mysterious connection between the heart and the brain, a connection which is   essential for our continued evolution as a species. The author believes that we will not continue evolving or even survive as a species without that understanding.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The book explains:&lt;/p&gt;
The theory of &lt;I&gt;neoteny&lt;/I&gt; and why this is the most crucial aspect of human evolution. 
Why &lt;I&gt;synchronicity&lt;/I&gt; is the &lt;I&gt;law&lt;/I&gt; by which human beings will live in the future. 
How left-brain dominance has led to nearly all of the problems we face today. 
Why Nature is far more profound and mysterious than science allows. 
Why seeing the Universe as a hologram answers so many puzzling questions. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Love&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;/I&gt;compassion, passion&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;joy, goodness&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;beauty&lt;/I&gt;, are the birthright of every human being, built into our genes and intended by Nature to speak in every beat of our heart. The book shows us the delightful steps of joy and lightness which will not only take us several evolutionary steps forward, but will help us save our beautiful planet. Astonishingly, this could all be accomplished in &lt;I&gt;less than a generation&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
