  <title>Meet Me in the Trunk - Yvonne Hilton Bourgeois</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself in a storm of someone elses making? For author Yvonne Hilton Bourgeois, that storm came in the midst of family difficulties. To get through it and realize she could not depend on herself to fix it, she began to visualize climbing into the trunk of her car, closing the trunk, and letting God drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Meet Me in the Trunk&lt;/i&gt;, Yvonne shares important lessons on how she learned to cast aside her own judgment and depend on God alone. Facing day-to-day stresses at work, marriage difficulties, children, grandchildren, and relationships, Yvonne visited the trunk to let God minister to her anxious and wounded spirit. God never failed her, giving her messages to use for each situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With wit and wisdom, Yvonne breaks down each of these lessons and shows you how you can survive storms and even witness the rainbows that usually follow. She offers thought-provoking questions that challenge you to look deep inside your heart for the answers. Discussions include overcoming your humanness, setting aside selfishness, discovering the true meaning of the covenant, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone whose life journey hits a bump every once in a while, &lt;i&gt;Meet Me in the Trunk&lt;/i&gt; is an inspirational guide to letting God take control of your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
