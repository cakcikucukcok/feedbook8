  <title>Doing The Soldiers Next Door - Lizzy Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stan, the kid next door is home from the Army with some of his buddies. Jeri is home alone, and watching them around the pool. When they ask her to buy them some beer, that&#39;s the opening she&#39;s been looking for. She seduces Stan and then he moves the party next door to her house, and all four of them use her, sometimes in combination, taking her hard and unprotected.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
The guys I was looking at, staring at actually, were all young, fit, and so hot they made me shiver. I could see them over the fence, hanging around Fred and Donna&#39;s pool, wearing tight black swim suits that made their crotches look wonderful. One of them was Stan, Fred and Jerry&#39;s son, home from Army training. He&#39;d always been good looking but after Special Forces training, he had become a delicious hunk.
“Stan&#39;s going to have some of his Army buddies over while we go to Aspen to ski,” Fred told us. “I hope they aren&#39;t too noisy.”
“I&#39;ll be out of town for three days,” Jeff said. He&#39;s my husband. “Jeri is the one who will have to deal with whatever they get up to.”
“It&#39;ll be fine,” I told him.
I was a lot better than fine…I was smoking. The man-flesh show was great. Four hot guys screwing around in the pool next door was giving me ideas. Jeff was a nice guy, but not always the most exciting, and long hours on his job were getting him down. Me, I sit at home and write romance novels and get horny.
At the moment I was wound up pretty fucking tight, I can tell you.
I sat out by our pool in shorts and a halter top writing. That&#39;s my usual uniform for working. I tried not to be too obvious about watching them. I was supposed to be rewriting a sex scene in my book…my editor thought it should be hotter…but my attention was on the testosterone next door. Part of my mind was wondering if there was a subtle way to get them interested in inviting me to join them.
That was silly of course. I&#39;m thirty-two and these guys were nineteen or twenty. They would be after girls their own age. Of course, except for Stan, they were all from other parts of the country and they didn&#39;t have a lot of time for checking out local girls.
So I nursed my fantasy. Naturally that made focusing on my work a problem, and when Stan came through the gate, looking sheepish, I looked up at him glad for the interruption.
As he came in I took a good look. Damn, but he had grown up. His abs were fantastic. He&#39;d been a stocky kid, and now he was quite a man, powerful arms and legs.
“What&#39;s up, Stan? Are you guys having fun?”
He stared awkwardly. “The thing is… I wondered if you&#39;d get us some beer.”
“You can&#39;t get it yourselves?”
“No. None of us are 21 yet…that&#39;s the legal age. Seeing as we go off to combat next week, we wanted to have a little fun. You know my mom and dad are teetotalers, and wouldn&#39;t get it, but I know you and Jeff drink, so I was hoping…”
“Say no more. You guys deserve a nice party before you go. I&#39;m glad to help. I wasn&#39;t getting any work done anyway.”
