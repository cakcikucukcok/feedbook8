  <title>The Hemingway Thief - Shaun Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;[A] stellar debut&amp;hellip;. Filled with charming pop-culture references, this deft caper novel is by turns laugh-out-loud funny and poignant.&amp;rdquo; --Publishers Weekly STARRED REVIEW Novelist Henry &amp;ldquo;Coop&amp;rdquo; Cooper is contemplating a new book between sipping rum and lounging on a Baja beach with hotel owner Grady Doyle. When Grady tries to save a drunk from two thugs, Coop tags along for the sake of a good story. The drunk is Ebbie Milch, a small-time thief on the run in Mexico because he has stolen the never-before-seen first draft of Ernest Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s A Moveable Feast from a wealthy rare book dealer. The stolen manuscript is more than just a rare piece of literary history. It reveals clues to an even bigger prize: the location of a suitcase the young, unpublished Hemingway lost in Paris in 1922. A year&amp;rsquo;s worth of his stories had vanished, never to be seen again. Until now. But Coop and Grady aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones with their eyes on this elusive literary prize, and what starts as a hunt for a legendary writer&amp;rsquo;s lost works becomes a deadly adventure. For Coop this story could become the book of a lifetime . . . if he lives long enough to write it. From the Trade Paperback edition." />
