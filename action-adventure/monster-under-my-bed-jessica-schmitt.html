  <title>Monster Under My Bed - Jessica Schmitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Ali Sable is full of unbridled hopes and dreams as she makes the trek from the small town of AuTrain, Michigan, to start a promising new life in Chicago. Ali knows no one as she arrives in Chi-town, but all of that is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ali settles into her corporate marketing job, she soon meets Chad Rockwell, a handsome co-worker who, despite being engaged to another woman, slithers into Alis life as gracefully as any man pursuing an attractive woman. Captivated by his charm and good looks, Ali is not surprised when Chad takes possession of her heart. But it is not long before Chads true colors emerge, revealing a monster who maliciously traps Ali into a situation with no way out. As his unpredictable demeanor and deadly actions immobilize Ali, the worst possible scenario follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when Ali thinks she has set herself free and begins to heal from within, Chad performs the unthinkable. Now it is up to Ali to not only save herself, but also another innocent life from the claws of a monster focused on doing whatever 
it takes to conquer his evil plan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
