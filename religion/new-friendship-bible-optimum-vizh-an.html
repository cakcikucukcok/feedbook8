  <title>New Friendship Bible - Optimum Vizh-an</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The NFB is written in the theme of God desiring to have friends made in His likeness. His desire emerges from the back drop of basking in His omnipresence for countless of eons. Then at one moment, He finds Himself deep in His loneliness. After wrestling with Himself, for more eons, He realizes He longs for a friend. With every bit of His infinite wisdom, He sets out in pursuit to remove all of His loneliness. This adventure will take Him to all of the edges of His omni existence; in all of His infinite dimensions. He will make eternal commitments and personal sacrifices to reassure Himself, that our friendship with Him; will not be by force, not by intimidation and defiantly not by keeping a set of rules.
The NFB was created with new books and thoughts based on a compilation of traditionally accepted scriptures; for the purpose of encouraging us to pursue a more enriching relationship with God.
Over 400 Meditationals, for personal and or group studies, were added through out the NFB to stimulate our hearts, our minds to embrace Gods friendship with us, in a fresh new way. 
With the NFB, we can imagine God: desiring to have an unconditional love friendship with us versus through a list of rules; revealing His new friendship with those who have never seen or heard His story before; and His manifesting a deeper friendship with us, through our lifes passions, through our particular needs and through our businesses." />
