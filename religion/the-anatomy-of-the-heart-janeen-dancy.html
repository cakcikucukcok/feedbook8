  <title>The Anatomy of the Heart - JaNeen Dancy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is with the heart that we believe. When we receive Jesus into our hearts, we are declared His own and are transformed into His likenessinto a new person in Christ. The sad reality is that while many Christians truly believe, they struggle to find a clear picture of how spiritual transformation is to take place in their life. Over and over, the Bible points to the heart as the agent of our transformation, but the scriptures do not refer to the physical heart beating in our chests. But could they? What if the physical heart could serve as a compelling model of spiritual development and transformation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from examples in scripture as well as her own challenges with grasping the concept of spiritual transformation, in The Anatomy of The Heart, JaNeen Dancy challenges readers to take a closer look at the physical heart for insightful analysis of the spiritual heart. The hearts at the center of our physical life and spiritual life may be more similar than we know, and a greater understanding of one may lead to a deeper understanding, and ultimate victory, in the other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
