  <title>The Chosen Man - J G Harlond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the bulb of a rare flower blooms ambition and scandal  Rome 1635. As Flanders braces for another long year of war, a Spanish count presents the Vatican with a means of disrupting the Dutch rebels&#39; booming economy. His plan is brilliant. They just need the right man to implement it. Enter Ludovico da Portovenere, a charismatic spice and silk merchant. Intrigued by the Vatican&#39;s proposal-and hungry for profit-Ludo sets off for Amsterdam. His voyage is interrupted, first by a timid English priest with a message from Rome, then by a storm, then by a pirate raid. The storm brings him a quick-witted young admirer he uses as a spy. The pirate raid brings him a girl, Alina, who won&#39;t go home. Each development has significant consequences for Ludo&#39;s plans and even greater ones for the people he is involved with. Set in a world of international politics and domestic intrigue, The Chosen Man spins an engrossing tale about the Dutch financial scandal known as tulip mania-and how decisions made in high places can have terrible repercussions on innocent lives.  &quot;J.G. Harlond is a real find. The Chosen Man is a novel with everything going for it: a cracking story centered on an intriguing and charismatic hero... the author wants to pull you in and entertain you. And succeeds triumphantly. I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed there will be more.&quot; -- Sarah Harrison author of The Flowers of the Field trilogy" />
