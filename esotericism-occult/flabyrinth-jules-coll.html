  <title>Flabyrinth - Jules Coll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For every woman who’s ever looked in the mirror and felt crap: a funny, filthy and uplifting account of one woman’s quest to leave body insecurity behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jules Coll was a slim child, which was misleading in a way, as she spent her formative years doing little other than consuming vast quantities of sugar and plotting to secure her next fix. It wasn’t until her late teens, when hormones began playing havoc with her metabolism, that Jules’s diet began to take its toll. Year by year, pound by pound, her weight began to tick upwards until she was tipping the scales at 19 stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Self-esteem at rock bottom, her love life on life support, Jules decided it was time to contemplate a radical change. &lt;i&gt;Flabyrinth&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Jules’s escape from maximum insecurity prison. As well as sharing her journey from thin to fat and back again, it’s a hilariously, refreshing and honest take on what it feels like to be a girl!&lt;/p&gt;" />
