  <title>Tenth Golden Strategies for Great Time Management - Dr. Abdul Wahab Bin Shabbab Al Shmailan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is about time management and planning by using criteria that maintain the good investment of time in our lives. It is also one of the most important management factors for a mans success and goal achievement. Peter Drucker in 1982 said, Time is the most valuable resource for a manager. If he could not manage his time, he would not be able to manage anything.
That is why time management is considered as one of the essential issues that man should care about. Most studies related to time management confirmed that good governance is closely related to performance, improvement, and productivity enhancement. Francis Becon said, Time is the scale of management as money is the scale of commodities and goods.
Although time is a unique commodity, it is equally given to each individual regardless of job or location, so time passes in a constant and limited speed. But it seems that no one has enough time. We also cannot create more time. We have to manage using the time given to us." />
