  <title>Priya in Heels - Ayesha Patel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love doesn&#39;t conquer all...does it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priya Patel strives to be the perfect daughter for her traditional Indian parents. With her medical residency underway, she faces the inevitable pressures to marry an Indian man of her parents&#39; choosing. She&#39;s perfectly content to do so until the Irish-American musician down the hall gets her attention and destroys everything she has worked so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler O&#39;Conner can&#39;t stop thinking about the beautiful doctor who treated his sprained ankle in the ER. But between weekend band gigs, an intense workload at NASA, and trying to lower Priya&#39;s barriers, he doesn&#39;t expect to fall in love...with a woman who is meant to marry another man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priya struggles to maintain her relationship with her parents, to be their source of happiness, but falling for an American might be the one thing that unravels their world and leaves her in tattered pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously released on Entangled&#39;s Embrace imprint - September 2014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
