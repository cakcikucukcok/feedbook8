  <title>Assorted Thoughts Sour People - Maur Jones, Mr.Red Ink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hating ones own mother was something Jonathan could never imagine in his wildest dreams. She was the one who raised him and taught him how to love, but as time went on, he grew to understand her true nature. She gave him the lessons in life that would change him as a man forever. Only if his mother would have told him the truth about the world instead of feeding him fantasies and lies, maybe he would have never lost his way. So what do you do when you feel like love is all you need but all anyone will give you is hate? What do you do when you have given your last and the people who sucked you dry disappear? What do you do when you want someone to care but your problems aren&#39;t big enough for anyone to stop and listen? What do you do? What do you do when you are the only one that sees you? These questions stormed Jonathans mind as a child, but as a man he thought he found a solution to all his problems. 
As a young man Jonathan had the look that all the ladies desired and the bank account to match, but he had a deep and troubling secret. He wasn&#39;t the man he appeared to be. All the ladies who became hypnotized by his beauty were in for a long ride. By the time they found out the truth, their lives had already been turned upside down and their self-worth had been reduced to nothing. Jonathan was the destroyer of hearts and the demolisher of minds. He acted with no remorse for his victims-until someone finally cracked his shattered mind and exposed his true identity. 
For so long Jonathan believed that being tormented, deceived, and tricked was the game of life, so if anyone was faint of heart, with the backbone of a jelly fish, they deserved to be coned for his survival. He only respected those who were smart enough to play dumb and stubborn enough to never give up on their dreams, no matter who you had to step on to make those dreams come true. Jonathan thought he had the world figured out, but he never anticipated her." />
