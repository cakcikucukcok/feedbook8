  <title>Dreamcatcher - Vanessa Gant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We&#39;ve all heard the super hero stories. Teenager bitten by a radioactive bug, parents are killed and child seeks avengence, science project gone wrong, alien from another planet with powers. But what if all of the things we love about super heroes in comics were combined into one?
Avery Kendall is just like any other teenage girl her age. Except for the fact that her parents died when she was little, lives with her uncle in a huge house in a small town, and is suffering from nightmares. However, whatever happens in her dreams ends up happening in real life. Avery discovers that she has an ability, a super power, that lets her become any type of hero she can imagine. After finding a group of teens just like her, they form a super hero team to stop crime and bring justice. Avery develops not only with her powers but also as a person. She learns what really happened to her parents, who her real friends are, and who her real enemies are." />
