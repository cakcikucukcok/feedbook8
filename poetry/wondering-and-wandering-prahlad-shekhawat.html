My book of poems is based on a collection related to Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh. I have been visiting the area, particularly McLeod Ganj and its environs, for a long time. This has given me the opportunity to explore the area and its environment, reflect on my life, make sense of my experiences, and meet interesting people from a range of cultures. 
I also got a chance to learn about Buddhist philosophy and psychology and connect deeply with nature, especially the mountains. 
The poems relate to my deep connections to the place. They contain precious memories that will last." />
