  <title>Stolen Love Before/After - Loyd Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a fictional story of a young US Navy sailor who is stationed in Hawaii at the submarine base in Pearl Harbor, during the late activities of the Korean War. The main character&#39;s name is Alvin Knight, who is only eighteentall, good-looking, and has black hair.
While on watch duty at the base theater, Alvin meets the beautiful but much older wife of a commander of a destroyer serving off Korea. Her name is Loraine, a beautiful redhead with emerald-green eyes. As Loraine enters the theater with her very young son, she passes very close to Alvin and looks directly into his eyes and smiles a provocative smile that says I would like to know you better and enters the theater. Poor Alvin falls immediately in love with this ravishing woman, and within weeks, Loraine lures him into an affair and offers Alvin what he could not refuseher ravishing body on many occasions.
Alvin realizes this affair could send him to Leavenworth, Kansas, prison for enlisted men who defile the wives of officers when and if they are found out and charges are made by the officer. Luckily, Alvin calls the affair off but does not end his sordid ways. This period in his life is the before that you see in his life.
His life changes to a beautiful love story after he meets Marilyn. Marilyn is a beautiful Marilyn Monroe lookalike who comes into Alvin&#39;s life and creates a heaven-on-earth love story that is beautiful to read as you experience the changes that Marilyn&#39;s love brings into his life after he completes his service and returns home to begin a business career, which reaches the height of success as he eventually becomes president of a large insurance company and takes it to a multibillion-dollar corporation through his leadership. The story of him, Marilyn, and their family is the after in their wonderful life.
Alvin is a builder whose tactics in creating value in business relations and morale building in the companies associates and clients and his family are a must-read that will be inspiring to anyone who reads this book. I know that you will not be disappointed.
The reader may like to read the author&#39;s first romantic and action novel, cowritten with Marvin R. Query, titled Reap the Wild Seeds." />
