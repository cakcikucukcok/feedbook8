  <title>David Copperfield (with an Introduction by Edwin Percy Whipple) - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The eighth novel of Charles Dickens, which was first published serially between May 1849 and November 1850, “David Copperfield,” is viewed as one of the most autobiographical of all the author’s novels. A classic coming-of-age story, it is the tale of its titular character from childhood to maturity which chronicles the struggle between the emotional and moral aspects of his life. Central to the theme of the novel is the idea of the disciplined heart. Dickens suggests that people basically fall into three categories: those who have one, those who don’t, and those who seek to cultivate one. It is this development of a disciplined heart inside David Copperfield which establishes the principal context of his relationships throughout the novel. David’s story is one filled with trials and tribulations which he struggles to overcome in his pursuit of a happy and fulfilled life. Considered by many as one of Dickens’s greatest works, “David Copperfield” remains as popular today as when it was first published. This edition includes an introduction by Edwin Percy Whipple." />
