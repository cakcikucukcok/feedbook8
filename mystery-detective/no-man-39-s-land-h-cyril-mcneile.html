  <title>No Man&#39;s Land - H. Cyril McNeile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Battle of Messines (7&amp;ndash;14 June 1917) was an offensive conducted by the British Second Army, under the command of General Sir Herbert Plumer, on the Western Front near the village of Messines in Belgian West Flanders during the First World War. The Nivelle offensive in April and May had failed to achieve its more ambitious aims, led to the demoralisation of French troops and the dislocation of the Anglo-French strategy for 1917.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The offensive at Messines forced the Germans to move reserves to Flanders from the Arras and Aisne fronts, which relieved pressure on the French. The tactical objective of the attack at Messines was to capture the German defences on the ridge, which ran from Ploegsteert (Plugstreet) Wood in the south, through Messines and Wytschaete to Mt. Sorrel, to deprive the German 4th Army of the high ground south of Ypres. The ridge commanded the British defences and back areas further north, from which the British intended to conduct the &amp;ldquo;Northern Operation&amp;rdquo;, to advance to Passchendaele Ridge, then capture the Belgian coast up to the Dutch frontier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herman Cyril McNeile, MC (1888&amp;ndash;1937), commonly known as Cyril McNeile and publishing under the name H. C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper, was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the First World War, he started writing short stories and getting them published in the Daily Mail. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names, he was given the pen name &amp;quot;Sapper&amp;quot; by Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the Daily Mail; the nickname was based on that of his corps, the Royal Engineers." />
