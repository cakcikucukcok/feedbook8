  <title>Cleaned the Crocodile&#39;s Teeth - Terese Svoboda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Nuer are a cattle herding people who live along the Nile. Although only a half million in population, they were made world famous by anthropologist E. Evans Pritchard&#39;s classic &quot;The Nuer.&quot; Song is the art form most suited to their harsh climate and semi-nomadic existence.&amp;#160;Cleaned the Crocodile&#39;s Teeth&amp;#160;was translated by Terese Svoboda, who collected and transcribed them in the Sudan with the aid of a PEN/Columbia Fellowship. The National Endowment for the Humanities provided support for the completion of the project. However, Cleaned the Crocodile&#39;s Teeth is more than just the translation of these songs. Its linking narrative, which chronicles Svoboda&#39;s experiences and places the songs in their proper contexts, takes us along on the translator&#39;s sometimes difficult journey and gives us an even deeper glimpse into the often hard, but never hopeless lives of the Nuer.&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;" />
