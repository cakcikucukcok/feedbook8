      <meta name="description" content="A diner is the Grand Central Station of trucker gossip, and Misty learns that her friend Charlie hasn&amp;rsquo;t been doing well since their run-in with Roland&amp;rsquo;s flash cards. She visits him and finds Roland&amp;rsquo;s influence made a worse impression on Charlie than two puncture wounds could ever do. His daughter thinks he&amp;rsquo;s crazy and his house has all the makings of an aspiring junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlie&amp;rsquo;s paranoia digs six-feet deeper when an unexpected delivery is dropped in his lap. He begs Misty to help him, but she has her own problems to juggle as Owen Alston walks back into her life. He offers her a second chance at a date, but life and undeath threaten to get in the way of her free meal. New friendships are forged and new snarks are made as she navigates the crazy world that is her life." />
