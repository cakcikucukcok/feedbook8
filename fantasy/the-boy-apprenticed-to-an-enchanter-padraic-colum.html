  <title>The Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter -  Padraic Colum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As for the youth who had tried to steal the white horse that the King owned, he was bound hand and foot and taken into the castle of the King. There he was thrown down beside the trestles of the great table, and the hot wax from the candles that lighted the supper board dripped down upon him. And it was told to him that at the morrow&amp;rsquo;s sunrise he would be slain with the sword. Then the King called upon one to finish the story that was being told when the neigh of the white horse was heard in the stable. The story could not be finished for him, however, because the one who had been telling it was now outside, guarding the iron door of the stable with a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting at the supper board, could not eat nor refresh himself because there was no one at hand to finish the story for him. And that is the way that the story of The Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin." />
