  <title>The Explosion Chronicles: A Novel - Yan Lianke, Carlos Rojas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Man Booker International finalist Yan Lianke has been lauded for his imaginative satire and insightful cultural critique as &quot;one of China&amp;#8217;s greatest living authors&quot; (&lt;I&gt;Guardian&lt;/I&gt;). His internationally bestselling new novel, &lt;I&gt;The Explosion Chronicles&lt;/I&gt;, follows the excessive expansion of a rural community from small village to megalopolis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the Yi River on one side and the Balou Mountains on the other, the village of Explosion was founded more than a millennium ago by refugees fleeing a seismic volcanic eruption. But in the post-Mao era the name takes on a new significance as the community grows explosively from a small village to a vast metropolis. Behind this rapid expansion are members of the community&amp;#8217;s three major families, including the four Kong brothers; Zhu Ying, the daughter of the former village chief; and Cheng Qing, who starts out as a secretary and goes on to become a powerful political and business figure. Linked together by a complex web of loyalty, betrayal, desire, and ambition, these figures are the driving force behind their hometown&amp;#8217;s transformation into an urban superpower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brimming with absurdity, intelligence, and wit, &lt;I&gt;The Explosion Chronicles&lt;/I&gt; considers the high stakes of passion and power, the consequences of corruption and greed, the polarizing dynamics of love and hate between families, as well as humankind&amp;#8217;s resourcefulness through the vicissitudes of life.&lt;/div&gt;" />
