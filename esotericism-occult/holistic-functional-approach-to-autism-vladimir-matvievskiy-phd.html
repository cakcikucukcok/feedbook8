  <title>Holistic Functional Approach to Autism - Vladimir Matvievskiy PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within a sea of stories about autism, this is the only book that describes precise, functional self-control in order to overcome an autistic state. Video episodes of the case study demonstrate the systematic functional procedures, which help the low-functioning autistic boy to overcome autism radically due to learning functional self-control. In the text, each functional step and the holistic strategy have neurophysiologic explanations, and the results are introduced as predictable, observable, and measurable. Such breakthrough results are possible only in the case of an autistic person learning self-control over neurodynamic changes and following it in direct interactions with his surroundings in everyday living. 
The author of the book, the practitioners, and the family of the boy came with the boy through the series of natural experiments, experiencing the similar neurodynamic responses with the purpose to conduct and teach him precise self-control. The author scans the controlling process over the holistic, functional neurodynamic corrections. The content of the book is elicited from that actual process and for the purpose of such actual self-control. 
Knowing and controlling neurodynamic functioning for a normal person might be as natural as cleaning teeth or using a napkin. For an autistic child and for his parents, however, it is the only chance to overcome pervasive neurodynamic disorders. 
Nowadays parents face the problem of such self-control issues as neurodynamic shock. Only those who badly need it and rather deeply accept the approach are ready to learn it by doing, to test with their children the similar neurodynamic changes, and they always obtain success." />
