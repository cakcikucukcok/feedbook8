  <title>The Italian - Ann Radcliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Among the most sophisticated examples of Gothic romance, &quot;The Italian&quot; was written in 1797 at the height of Radcliffe&#39;s power as an author. The dark, shadowed Italy of this novel immediately encapsulates the fast-paced plot concerning Vincentio di Vivaldi and his beautiful love Ellena Rosalba. While they wish to marry, Vincentio&#39;s mother is against their marriage. Her scheming to separate them soon involves Schedoni, a mysterious monk, and arguably Radcliffe&#39;s most exceptional invention, whose sinister machinations cause the couple much strife. Radcliffe explores the ways in which concealment and disguise can threaten love and devotion, particularly during the Holy Inquisition, where crime and religion blend dangerously." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Italian - Ann Radcliffe</i></b> | The Italian, or the Confessional of the Black Penitents (1797) is a Gothic novel written by the English author Ann Radcliffe. It is the last book Radcliffe published during her lifetime (although she would go on to write the novel Gaston de Blondeville , it was only published posthumously in 1826).<br /><b><i>The Italian (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | First published in 1796, The Italian is Ann Radcliffe's last and most accomplished novel. To think that she began her writing career because she was bored while her husband traveled for work-related reasons! Well, she did her research and devoted a great deal of time to developing some good stories.<br /><b><i>The Italian (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural): Ann ...</i></b> | Ann Radcliffe defined the "terror" genre of writing and helped to establish the Gothic novel, thrilling readers with her mysterious plots and eerie effects. In The Italian she rejects the rational certainties of the Enlightenment for a more ambiguous and unsettling account of what it is to be an individual - particularly a woman - in a culture haunted by history and dominated by institutional power.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Italian - Ann Radcliffe</a> </h3></p><hr/>
