  <title>Dynamite Road - Andrew Klavan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jim Bishop is a hard man, as cold as the wind off the water and tough to the point of brutality. Scott Weiss is Bishop&#39;s boss, a world-weary ex-cop who runs a private detective agency out of a concrete tower in the heart of San Francisco. In this powerfully original series debut by award-winning and bestselling author Andrew Klavan, Weiss sends Bishop to investigate corruption at a Northern California airport-and so sets events in motion that will lead both men on a desperate hunt for a master assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishop&#39;s assignment is to investigate the airport and report back to Weiss.  But Bishop prefers to make up the rules as he goes along. He&#39;s willing to beat any man into the ground and draw any woman into his bed in order to get the answers he&#39;s after.  A pilot himself, he takes to the air to check out the illegal flights of a thug names Chris Wannamaker. Then he coolly seduces Wannamaker&#39;s lonely wife in order to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the city, as Weiss struggles to rein Bishop in, he begins a connected investigation of his own. A death in a mansion in Presidio Heights, a seemingly random murder South of Market, an apparent suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge, all seem to bear the mark of Weiss&#39; old nemesis, an expert gun-for-hire who goes by the name of the Shadowman. It&#39;s a trail of blood, and each step of it seems to bring Weiss closer to Julie Wyant, a mysterious beauty who captures the imagination of every man she meets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Bishop has found his way into the center of a massive criminal conspiracy, a plan set to climax with an act of audacious violence and a murder that would be impossible for any killer but one. And with his operative&#39;s wife in danger, Weiss begins a race against time to outsmart the murderer who stalks his nightmares and to rescue the woman who haunts his dream.  &lt;br&gt;If you like your tough guys really tough, your femme fatale and your action explosive-welcome to &lt;i&gt;Dynamite Road.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
