  <title>Hallelujah! Interviews with American Christian Poets as Read in Church of England Newspaper, London - Peter Menkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection of interviews with American Christian poets, published on the web by Church of England Newspaper, London, the ongoing series represented here includes Susan Wheeler, Philip Kolin, and Peter Cole, among others. Though a Christian collection, the secular Jewish poet and translator of note Peter Cole is included. Susan Wheeler teaches at Princeton, and Philip Kolin at University of Southern Mississippi. Each was interviewed in this ongoing series, still going on, by Religion Writer Peter Menkin. This is a living series.
 Philip Kolin has once again heard the whisper of Gods word with the ear of his heart and given poetic expression to the timeless value of that word.
From: Interview: Christian poet Philip Kolin of Mississippi, USA
lives his faith, telling readers here
of his workeverything you ever wanted to know
...Just this transpired. Against a tree I swooned and fell, and
water seeped into my shoe, and a dream began to grow in me.
Or despair, and so I chose the dream. And while I slept,
I was being fed, and clothed, addressed  as though awake
with every faculty, and so it went. Then: blaze, blare of sun
after years uncounted, and synesthesia of it and sound,
the juncos chirp and then the jays torn caw...
Susan Wheeler
From: Interview: Poet Susan Wheeler of New York City and Princeton University
The mystic, poet, secular Jewish married man of letters who is a scholar is reticent to use the word God in an interview, and even reticent to admit to a belief in the Almighty. Yet this religious and spiritual scholar and poet has a recent book of translations of works from the Kabbalah in the book titled The Poetry of Kabbalah: Mystical Verse from the Jewish Tradition.
This ancient discipline of understanding the Almighty in the Jewish tradition is a mystical and mysterious exercise in religious practice that continues into our own daythis 21st Century.
