  <title>Go! More Than a Game - Peter Shotwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Master the fascinating game of Go with this expert guidebook.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Go has enthralled hundreds of millions of people in Asia, where it is an integral part of the culture. In the West, many have learned of its pleasures, especially after the game appeared in a number of hit movies, TV series, and books, and was included on major Internet game sites. By eliciting the highest powers of rational thought, the game draws players, not just for the thrills of competition, but because they feel it enhances their mental, artistic, and even spiritual lives.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Go! More Than a Game&lt;/I&gt; is the guidebook that uses the most modern methods of teaching to learn Go, so that, in a few minutes, anyone can understand the two basic rules that generate the game. The object of Go is surrounding territory, but the problem is that while you are doing this, the opponent may be surrounding you! In a series of exciting teaching games, you will watch as Go&#39;s beautiful complexities begin to unfold in intertwining patterns of black and white stones. These games progress from small 9x9 boards to 13x13 and then to the traditional 19x19 size.&lt;/div&gt;" />
