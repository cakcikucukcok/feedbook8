      <meta name="description" content="On top of one of the monuments itself in Peponi is a weapon, the Akin-Eno used by the Final King of the Humans a weapon so great the Serwans (a race of Noble Ones) refuse to acknowledge that it has human origins but to esclaves the Akin-Eno is a gift from Heaven that was given to them some time after creation from Origin, the Creator God.  It is kept as a reminder by the Serwans of their victory over human kind... The Sentient War, the 600 year struggle that laid waste to the land of the humans and Ended the Age was told in every home.  As it came to an end there had only been a few human kingdoms left who still posed a threat to permanent control of the land of Kiskeya.  One Kingdom managed to unite neighboring territories through bloody civil wars and another had possession of the Tomb of Creation.  It is said that during the battle the Final King took the Akin-Eno and plunged it into a tree turning it to diamond and ever since the human race has been enslaved for over 2000 years." />
