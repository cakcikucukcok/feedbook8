Dennis, (1876-1938) was an Australian poet known for his humorous poems, especially &amp;quot;The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke&amp;quot;, published in the early 20th century. Though Dennis&amp;#39;s work is less well known today, his 1916 publication of The Sentimental Bloke sold 65,000 copies in its first year, and by 1917 he was the most prosperous poet in Australian history.&lt;br /&gt;
