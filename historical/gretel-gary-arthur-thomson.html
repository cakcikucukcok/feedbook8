  <title>Gretel - Gary Arthur Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The meal they ate in the inn was boiled cabbage, sliced cooked meats, and bread with a cup of red wine. There was horseradish to flavor the beef and butter to spread on the brot. They sat beside the big heating and cooking fireplace. A kettle hung from a hinged iron hook that pivoted over the fire. The fireplace was so large that they were almost sitting inside it. The warmth felt inviting and good. A tall canister of pigs knuckles simmered by the burning logs and an enormous pot of soup slow cooked on another hinge that could swing out to ladle a bowl of potato chowder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their guest had not yet arrived.&lt;br /&gt;
How did you come to know Geert of Deventer? the Landgraf asked Jan Cele making table conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
We were at the university together at Prague.&lt;br /&gt;
Prague. Thats impressive. The capitol of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;br /&gt;
For being so far to the east, it is impressive Cele affirmed.&lt;br /&gt;
The city of Good King Wenceslaus, the Landgraf exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;
I know a Christmas carol about him, chimed in Gretel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good King Wenceslaus looked out&lt;br /&gt;
On the Feast of Stephen&lt;br /&gt;
Where the snow lay round about&lt;br /&gt;
Deep and crisp and even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bravo! the men clapped and Gretel was embarrassed. But she was beginning to like the conversation of schooled companions.&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to be educated like yourselves, she blushed.&lt;br /&gt;
John Cele came to her rescue.&lt;br /&gt;
So you shall be and more, he said foreshadowing a bright future.&lt;br /&gt;
I would like that very much.&lt;br /&gt;
Education, affirmed the Landgraf, will set you free to be. . .&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that! John Cele said. Free to be! That is the question and answer education offers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
