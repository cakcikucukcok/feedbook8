  <title>To Wake the Dead - Steven W Woeste</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;To Wake The Dead&lt;/I&gt; is a new take on the raising the dead phenomenon. What happens when people rationally try to investigate the living dead, and to give meaning to their existence? Can such an otherworldly occurrence be justified with the current scientific understanding of living things? How would people, and society, react to raising the dead, especially if it were to become routine, and even done against their wishes?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Who would control the use of those who had the ability to raise the dead, and what would they be used to do? If it was our government, could they trusted? Ultimately, who could you trust?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;To Wake The Dead&lt;/I&gt; examines exactly what happens when the borders separating the living from the dead are redrawn, sometimes forcefully, and sometimes violently. No matter what positions the new boundaries occupy, the world will never be the same.&lt;/P&gt;" />
