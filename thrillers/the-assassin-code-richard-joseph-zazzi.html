  <title>The Assassin Code - Richard Joseph Zazzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most grandfathers show their grandsons how to fish or play baseball, but not in the Castinetti family. Joseph Castinetti has no idea that growing up in a traditional Italian family means total loyalty to the family and doing exactly what you are told. So when
his grandfather takes him target shooting, he never realizes that he is rehearsing to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.&lt;p&gt;
The benefit of being born into a traditional Italian family means a secure future with all the trappings of life in Americaunless the family is the Mafia. As Joseph is unwillingly thrust into a life of crime, he must perform dirty deeds as his grandfathers pawn
and bids to win favor at the highest levels of organized crime. As he becomes immersed deeper and deeper into the thick of the Mafias plans, it soon becomes apparent that they are grooming
Joseph for something special.&lt;p&gt;
If its true that once in the Mafia one is always bound to the Omert, Joseph must find a way out before it is too late." />
