  <title>My House Burned Down and Now I Can See the Stars: Reflections on Losing and Finding - Ann Hisle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Losing and finding are equally fundamental to life &amp;#8213; and loss is not the end of the story. Psychotherapist and bereavement counselor Ann Hisle offers sound advice and uplifting spiritual practices that help people cope with loss. Hisle&#39;s inspiring stories of hope, along with her selections of thought-provoking quotations, form the foundations for deeper living, greater loving, and a more powerful sense of humanity. &lt;BR&gt;Starting with an acknowledgement of the need for both good &lt;I&gt;and&lt;/I&gt; bad luck, the author discusses how we can learn from our suffering, the value of sharing our experiences, and the appreciation of apparent coincidences. She considers the innate rewards of forgiving and asking forgiveness, letting go and lightening up, and opening to a higher power. In addition, Hisle explores how our personal histories can instruct us; the balance of mental, physical, and spiritual needs; and the pulling together of collective wisdom for personal growth. Anyone who has struggled with accepting loss and moving beyond heartbreak toward a more balanced perspective will appreciate this book&#39;s practical and philosophical encouragement." />
