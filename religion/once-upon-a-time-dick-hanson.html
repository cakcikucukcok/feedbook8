  <title>Once Upon a Time - Dick Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Moral values are under attack. Although the United States of America was established with a firm position on Christian values and moralityon the fundamental belief that Gods laws were supremethis rich tapestry of American history and values has been tattered and torn by the introduction of principles inconsistent with the Founding Fathers beliefs. How can we then overcome this challenge and bring back integrity and honesty into contemporary life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Once upon a Time: A Guide to Moral Decision-Making, author Dick Hanson reclaims this lost set of values and provides insight and encouragement for dealing with the problems that beset humankind. Drawing from a variety of sources and offering a sense of the historical background of moral decision-making, Hanson uses a Christian, biblical perspective to articulate a decision-making process that can help show people the way forward with courage and resolve. Replete with examples of people who have made moral decisions, each chapter provides inspirational guidelines and scriptural references that will today assist each person in making moral decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The themes of honesty, integrity, spirituality, and morality run as a thread through the tapestry of history, culminating in the formation of the United States of America and its enduring principles. Despite the moral relativism that permeates our day, God has a set of moral rules and a code of conduct that will bring us back to a high standard of moral behaviorsomething we so need in our day and time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
