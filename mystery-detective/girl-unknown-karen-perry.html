The recent stresses of home renovation and of a brief romantic betrayal (Caroline&#39;s) are behind them. The Connollys know and care for each other deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one early fall afternoon, a student of sublime, waiflike beauty appears in David&#39;s university office and says, &quot;I think you might be my father.&quot; And the fact of a youthful passion that David had tried to forget comes rushing back.  In the person of this intriguing young woman, the Connollys may have a chance to expand who they are and how much they can love, or they may be making themselves vulnerable to menace. They face either an opportunity or a threat--but which is which? What happens when their hard-won family happiness meets a hard-luck beautiful girl?&lt;/p&gt;" />
