  <title>Silver - Beax Rivers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Despite her light-tan skin, Zarah is, in her own words, the blackest black chick anyone could ever meet. Raised by parents who came of age in the 1960s, she is proud of her identity: Mississippi born and raised, pro-blackand anti-white. As a student in the College of Communications at Jackson City University, she is clear about her commitment to black people and to staying close to home once she has earned her PhD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart, ambitious, and beautiful, Zarah aspires to be a journalist and, eventually, an executive editor. She has one big problem: landing her dream internship in publishing means working for someone whitesomeone shes not sure she can stand to be around. When Zarah finally meets legendary publishing mogul Harvey Wilson, she fully expects him to be the jerk she has always envisioned. Instead she falls in love with him and is forced to question everything she thought she knew about herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mississippi to New York to Hawaii and back, Zarah and Harvey are swept up in a passionate romance. But the couple faces differences in race, class, and agenot to mention the fact that Harvey is still married. With so many obstacles to happiness, its difficult to see how their love can survive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenging long-held ideas about what makes love last, &lt;i&gt;Silver: Currents of Change&lt;/i&gt; is a romantic story about an unlikely couples unpredictable journey to true love and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
