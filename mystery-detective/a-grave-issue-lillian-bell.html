  <title>A Grave Issue - Lillian Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;After an on-air gaffe goes viral and jeopardizes her career, journalist Desiree Turner retreats home to Verbena, California for some peace and quiet. She begins working one of the quietest jobs around: presiding over funerals for her great-grandfather’s funeral parlor. But the action seems to follow her as a fistfight breaks out between neighbors Rosemarie Brewer and Lola Hansen at one of the first funerals she’s in charge of running. It exposes a nasty dispute and Rosemarie’s husband, Alan, is found murdered shortly after.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lola’s husband, Kyle, is immediately arrested. Desiree, whose own father’s death was devastating, has always viewed Kyle as a second father. Determined to clear his name, Desiree jumps head first into the investigation and quickly discovers that Alan had several unsavory habits at his job and in his personal life, including putting assets into his mistress’s account to hide them from Rosemarie. People murder for money and love all the time, and there’s no telling who he offended just enough to push them over the edge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Desiree is looking in all the right places, but she better catch the killer fast before they come for her next in &lt;i&gt;A Grave Issue&lt;/i&gt;, the clever series debut by Lillian Belle.&lt;/div&gt;" />
