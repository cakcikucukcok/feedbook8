  <title>A Condition of Complete Simplicity - Rowan Clare Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Condition of Complete Simplicity offers a practical exploration of three essential keynotes of Francisc an spirituality - humility, love and joy - as they can be lived out in a world that is often characterised by violence, greed and religious conflict. This is our world, and it was also Francis&#39; world - a furnace for forging the radical values of those who cast off possessions, status, security and everything that stood in their way of following Christ. Franciscan wisdom, with its emphasis on the upside-down values of the kingdom of God, has an urgent relevance for many of the problems we encounter today. Francis&#39; turning away from his youthful ambitions inspires us to do battle with our false priorities and find our true vocation. His acknowledging of all creatures as his brothers and sisters challenges us to recognize the image of the Creator in every individual. His infectious love for all creation gives us cause for hope and rejoicing as we learn to find and reflect Christ&#39;s presence throughout his world." />
