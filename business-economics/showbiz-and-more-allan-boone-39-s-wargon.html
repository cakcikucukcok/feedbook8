  <title>Showbiz, and More - Allan Boone&#39;s Wargon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novella, poetry and these short stories cover the entire range of human emotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novella, Showbiz, tells the story of an unusual man&amp;#39;s great achievements and reach for an ideal, only to have everything he is and has accomplished defeated by the nature of his inner being and those who prey on it. His close friend experiences, in tandem, his own fulfillment and loss. Both are engulfed by the shallowness and cynicism of politics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The poems &amp;mdash; the 150 sonnets of Affairs &amp;mdash; deal with yearning, love, illusion and despair; they are a human cry against the complexities and restrictions of the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The short tales of Three Stories are tender and dark, observing the hopes and brutalities of men and women." />
