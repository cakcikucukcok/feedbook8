  <title>The Storyteller&#39;s Throne - Jocelyn Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grace was born a storyteller with a beautifully brilliant mind. Trauma twisted her reality into its own tale of darkness. &amp;nbsp;Now, at eighteen, Grace has found herself on the shores of a shadow world created to heal a generation. A world whose purpose is to release our emotions from the bonds of youth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But she is not alone. It&amp;#39;s a world inhabited by others, those working on their own hearts and one other like herself. An amazing and yet afflicted empath and musician by the name of Kai that Grace feels inexplicably drawn to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Will she be able to handle the suppressed memories of her youth? Accept the vulnerability necessary to explore her own heart and that of another? Fulfill the true purpose it seems she is destined to serve? &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Come along with Grace as she learns to uncover her past, harness her gift, open her heart to love and embrace her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
