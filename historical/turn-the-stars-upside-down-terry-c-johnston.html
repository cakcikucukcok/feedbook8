  <title>Turn the Stars Upside Down - Terry C. Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turn the Stars Upside Down&lt;/i&gt; is the compelling and little-known story of Crazy Horse&#39;s surrender in 1877 only months after his last fight with the U.S. Army at Battle Butte, his futile attempts to find peace for his warrior heart among the reservation Indians, and his eventual undoing at the hands of his own Oglala people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all his life, this warrior has been a defender of the weak and helpless. But surrounded now on a tiny red island in a sea of white, he finds himself powerless against the forces arrayed against him in what will ultimately be his battle, waged against deceptive army officers, and even against Oglala leaders who whisper, connive, and conspire behind his back to bring about his fall. Even more disastrous will be those friends who once fought at his side against the encroaching white tide--friends who now turn against him, joining his enemies in plotting against this last great hero of the Lakota people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning and bestselling frontier author Terry C. Johnston brings all his talent to bear in this tragic tale of betrayal, with all the immediacy and emotion he has so skillfully created in thirty previous novels. No story of the Indian Wars would be complete without this final episode in the short life of Crazy Horse, a story of treachery and deception, but also--ultimately--of the victory of the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
