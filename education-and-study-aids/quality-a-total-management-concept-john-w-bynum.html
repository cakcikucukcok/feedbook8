  <title>Quality: a Total Management Concept - John W. Bynum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;This book delineates a management style which is bottom-up rather than top-down, that is, it is employee-centered and allows employees to influence management decisions. Shrouded in the mist the reader will recognize both old established and newly innovative management styles and embedded in these the Japanese concept of Kaizen will be clandestinely apparent. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;An employee-centered management system is a dynamic function capable or successfully competing in an environment of economic fluctuations and changing market trends. The interaction of employees and the creative forces they generate as they solve and re-synthesize labor and production problems is an aggressive strategy which is nurtured and sustained by its own internal energy. Employees are the most important asset of business and industry and their full and effective utilization is a major responsibility of business management. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;People perform to the standards of their leaders, and business enterprises are no exception. Managers who lead by example are the most effective leaders; it is character through which leadership is exercised and it is character that sets the example and is imitated in turn. It is the character of management that projects the corporate image and personifies the philosophy of the business. &lt;/P&gt;" />
