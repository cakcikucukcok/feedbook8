  <title>One Spirit Place - Beverly A Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The journey of the soul and the physical person are closely intertwined. The soul needs a physical body to experience and create; the body needs a soul to be human. Incarnated souls often find themselves in a quandary: the person doesnt hear the elusive voice of their soul, and so they are unable to co-create the life they came to experience. If your desire is to have a higher understanding of your life purpose and create profound positive change in your current life situation, the key lies in understanding the powerful connection between the physical person and their soul. The first step is to reacquaint yourself with higher levels of spiritual truths and universal laws. Relevant stories will assist you in understanding your true essence of energy and spirit. The second step is to honestly evaluate yourself on your life experiences and decisions to determine if you are moving toward or away from your oneness with soul. A questionnaire is provided to assist you in this assessment. The goal is to understand how to realign your consciousness and physical body with the voice of your soul to achieve union and harmony and create whatever life experiences you desire. &lt;/p&gt;" />
