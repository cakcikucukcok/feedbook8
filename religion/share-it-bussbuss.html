      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book began out of need in my family situation.  The idea to write down my life experience is not a coincidence or an afterthought but an inspiration from God and my kids to publish this book.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to jot down these experiences for keepsake for my son, Isaac. Isaac is deaf with special needs. He is the main inspiration for my writing down of what life has taught me. We take for granted the amount of things we learn as a person who can hear (who is audible) without formal teaching. Most of our life lessons are picked up during conversation which is different with a deaf person. The need to equip Isaac with lifes road map, to give Isaac structured guidance, motivated me to write down these entries. His receptive language is strong since he is a visual learner. This project is very exciting to us, my kids and I. There is a saying, the faintest ink is better than the most retentive memory; I constantly battle how much can I write down and when  to stop. As a mother, I have the responsibility to equip my kids for life in a Godly way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we may not have a choice of what life gives to us but we certainly have a choice in what we do with it. I have learned a lot being Isaacs mum. I no longer take things for granted but make teachable moments with my children, especially my son.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not expect everyone to agree with all my entries because your life experiences are different from my own. However, we can both agree on the fact that these life experiences help shape our journey in life. Some of these entries l have learned through disappointments, hard times and fun times while some have brought me spiritual growth, joy, hope, fulfillment and a degree of efficiency to my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. I hope you will be encouraged to share your own life experience to enrich the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
