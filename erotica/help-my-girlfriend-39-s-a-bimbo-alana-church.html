  <title>Help! My Girlfriend&#39;s A Bimbo! - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bimbo Pill is in full effect! Under its influence, Max has taken both his mother and his sister as his lovers. But when his jealous ex-girlfriend finds out the truth, will this spell disaster for the family? Or will Gwen&amp;#39;s bi-curious urges lead them all to a world of sexual delight?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Um...&amp;quot; Max seemed to want to ask a question, but was too frightened of her to actually put it into words.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well?&amp;quot; she asked impatiently. &amp;quot;Spit it out!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Um. Gwen. Are you, like, bisexual? Or a lesbian? Is that why you&amp;#39;re so angry at me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Of course she&amp;#39;s not a lesbian,&amp;quot; Linda put in. &amp;quot;I can see the way she looks at you, Max. She still wants you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But she&amp;#39;s looking at me the same way.&amp;quot; She licked her lips. &amp;quot;Hungry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gwen swallowed. Her throat was as dry as the Mojave. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m bisexual. I think.&amp;quot; She swallowed again, looking at Max&amp;#39;s beautiful, blonde-haired sister. &amp;quot;When I was a freshman, we were in the same gym class. Do you remember?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linda frowned, and shook her head. &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despair raked its claws down her spine. &amp;quot;No. Of course you don&amp;#39;t,&amp;quot; she said dully. &amp;quot;Why would you? I was fourteen years old, and had zits all over my face, and you were already drop-dead gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I waited every day for sixth period. Not because I liked soccer or softball or any of that crap. But because when we showered I might see you naked. Just for a few minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That revelation seemed to penetrate the haze of the pill, because Linda blinked. &amp;quot;Oh.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I fantasized about you. In bed.&amp;quot; She blushed, remembering some of those late-night sessions, her fingers frantically rubbing herself under the blankets, hoping her breathy moans wouldn&amp;#39;t be heard through the bedroom door.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You wanted to screw me?&amp;quot; Linda asked curiously. She smiled at Gwen. &amp;quot;Well, why didn&amp;#39;t you just ask?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You could have asked me, silly!&amp;quot; Linda giggled charmingly. She bounced up out of her seat on the couch, while Max looked on, completely flummoxed. &amp;quot;Ooh. You&amp;#39;ve got great boobs,&amp;quot; she said, eyeing her bust covetously. &amp;quot;Can I touch them?&amp;quot;" />
