  <title>The One Less Traveled - J.C. Wittol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This anthology features the first five erotic stories from the celebrated series, The One Less Traveled, a steamy collection of books involving a gorgeous hotwife, a dominant black man, and a reluctant husband who evolves into an eager cuckold.
Nick and Nicole are the quintessential married-with-children suburban couple. Nicole seeks a boyfriend. Nick wants a happy wife. When they search for excitement outside their marriage and connect with a rich, handsome black stranger who desires control, a tempestuous erotic ride through the rapids of a carnal cuckold relationship ensues.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
“I thought you got lost out there. I was going to send a search party and maybe call 911,” I said sarcastically.
Irritation flashed in her eyes. “What did you think was going to happen? Besides, you don’t like to dance, and I do.” She grabbed her drink, and finished it in two swallows.
“You’re right, honey. Please don’t be mad. You stayed out there a little longer than I anticipated, and I felt neglected. I’m sorry.” I handed her another drink, and took her hand. “I want us to have fun tonight, so feel free to dance your ass off.”
She took a sip of her drink, then leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek. “Are you sure? Because I don’t want to upset you.” She paused and met my eyes. “So you’re sure you’ll be okay if I dance a lot with other men?”
“Absolutely.” I put on my most reassuring smile, and made the decision to open up and confide in her. “Actually, watching you dance with him turned me on. You looked hot, and he was clearly into you.”
“Good.” A playful smile curved her lips. “So,” she added, and cocked her head at me. “It turns you on to watch me, huh?”
“Well…”
Just as she finished her question, and a strong, deep baritone voice sounded over my shoulder.
“I apologize for interrupting, but you are absolutely gorgeous. May I join you two?”
The voice came around from behind me, and I got a chance to see the speaker, a well-dressed black man with sharp, expressive eyes and an easy smile. I stood as he moved around the table, and I realized that he towered over me by at least six to eight inches. Nicole stood, too, and smiled widely at him.
“Hi. My name is Collin,” he said, and took her hand. “I noticed you on the dance floor, and I had to come over and meet you. You are an amazing dancer.”
“Thank you.” My wife beamed up at him, and made no effort to take her hand back. “I’m Nicole. We don’t get out as often as we used to, and I really miss dancing.” She paused, and then motioned at me. “Sorry, this is my husband, Nick.”
He finally broke eye contact with her as she finished and mentioned my name.
“Nick,” he said, repeating my name as though he wanted to remember it. “Nice to meet you. You’re a lucky man.”
“Nice to meet you, too…and yes, I’m the lucky husband. Thanks for coming up and introducing yourself.”
I wanted to be gracious, and at first glance, he seemed like a genuinely nice guy. I figured it must take courage to approach a couple in a swingers club.
Nicole was devouring him with her eyes, so I motioned to the empty chair. “Why don’t you join us?”
His smile widened, and he nodded his thanks before all of us sat down. We were at a small round table that had three chairs, so we were able to carry on a conversation despite the music.
When the next song came on, he motioned at the dance floor. “Would you like to dance?”
“Yes.” Her reply was out of her mouth almost before he stopped speaking.
“Do you mind, Nick?” he asked, turning to me.
“That’s fine,” I surrendered with a forced grin. “You two kids have fun.”
My wife’s reaction surprised me. She’d always said that she didn’t find black men attractive, but she looked at Collin like a starving person at a buffet. I didn’t know if her taste in men had changed, or if she’d kept her taste for black men a secret during our marriage. Either way, my heart started racing as they walked away." />
