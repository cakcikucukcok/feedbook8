  <title>Restless Seasons - David Matson Hooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Steve Dupree, an aspiring folksinger, sees his high school buddy Vic Power as everything Dupree dreams of being: a self-assured songwriter who hustles gigs out of thin air, relentlessly pursuing the dream of stardom.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bound by their love for music and the urge to see the world, their paths cross again and again over ten years and two continents. Their sometimes volatile musical partnership takes them from the beaches of Southern California to the German Alps to the canal-lined streets of Amsterdam and beyond. Along the way, Dupree learns lessons about love, loyalty, courage, and, ultimately, himself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As part of the international hippie movement of the late sixties and early seventies, Dupree and Power hop borders, dodge authorities, and share casual drugs and fleeting lovewhile tensions between the two threaten to tear their traveling band apart.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As in his first novel, Avalon Summer, author David Matson Hooper seeks to capture place and time in vivid language, illuminating both the sunny ideals and the sometimes stormy realities of what it means to spend seasons in the wind.&lt;/P&gt;
