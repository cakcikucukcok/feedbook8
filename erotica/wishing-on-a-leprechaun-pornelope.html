      <meta name="description" content="Bishop and Maggie are determined not to let their parents&amp;#39; tragic deaths ruin their long-awaited vacation to Ireland. Then a puckish leprechaun grants their most secret wish...the forbidden taboo passion they&amp;#39;ve both secretly dreamed about!

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia had always resented Maggie, whose ethereal waiflike beauty had made her seem big and clumsy in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She hadn&amp;#39;t been clumsy in bed, he thought wistfully. Far from it. But he hadn&amp;#39;t loved her; walking away after that last stormy argument had been easy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And her caustic accusations had stung, especially because they&amp;#39;d been so insulting.&lt;i&gt; &amp;quot;I swear you two act more like lovers than siblings! Sleeping in her bed is just perverted, Bishop...and don&amp;#39;t give me that old song about how she&amp;#39;s so lost and afraid right now! So what if she has nightmares? They&amp;#39;ll never stop if you keep coddling her like an invalid! How long before she turns to you for &lt;u&gt;everything&lt;/u&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; And it had been clear from her revolted expression that everything&amp;#39; included explosive, illicit sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That had been the final straw, and he&amp;#39;d stalked from her apartment in a cold fury.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He missed the sultry pleasure he&amp;#39;d always found between her parted thighs, though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia was wrong. There was nothing evil or perverted about offering comfort to a sobbing teenage girl whose tender heart had been broken.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He adored Maggie...of course he did! She was his little sister! But he didn&amp;#39;t feel the slightest sexual attraction for her. Why, even the thought of gliding his hands over her petite body was...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oddly disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He realized, with sudden horrified shock, that he was getting hard, and his eager shaft was straining mindlessly against his jeans zipper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia&amp;#39;s fault, he sternly reminded himself. She&amp;#39;d been a delusional, treacherous bitch, but there was no denying she&amp;#39;d been dynamite in bed. Absolutely anything had been fair game, and she&amp;#39;d been incredibly inventive!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Down, boy! &lt;/i&gt;he commanded his eager shaft when it thrust up even higher, and swelled to its full impressive size. &lt;i&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t going to be deprived forever. When we get back to the States... Or maybe we&amp;#39;ll meet up with a cute Irish lass who&amp;#39;ll be just as warm and willing as Cynthia was, and she&amp;#39;ll help us ease the tension.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Briefly he tried to imagine seducing the pretty barmaid who&amp;#39;d served them last night. Her curvy body had been lush, and her teasing wink had been inviting. If Maggie hadn&amp;#39;t been there, he&amp;#39;d have invited her to his hotel room, eased her out of that skimpy uniform, stretched her out on the bed, spread her long legs wide, and...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The zipper was starting to bite into his sensitive flesh. Flushing, he dropped back a few paces, then hastily rearranged his briefs to ease the growing pain. That helped a little...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the moment his willful mind began wandering again, the sassy barmaid&amp;#39;s ripe body morphed into perfectly-shaped creamy skin that quivered beneath his eager palms and tasted like ambrosia. And the breathless voice that rose in ecstatic delight when he thrust deep into her tight little passage was far too familiar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He jolted so violently that Maggie cast him a startled glance, and he hastily swatted at a nonexistent bug before she could ask what was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He wasn&amp;#39;t getting unbearably aroused by fantasizing about his pretty little sister; the very idea was unthinkable!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;So why couldn&amp;#39;t he stop thinking about it?&lt;/i&gt;" />
