  <title>Forever Home Within - Vanessa Bunting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a true story about finding ones forever homeliterally and spiritually. It depicts the life of a woman who lived mostly solo.
In this tale set in southeastern England in the 1960s, Vanessa grew up within a working class family whose values taught her to always appreciate the countryside, consider others, and care about animals. These values stayed with her even after her parents painful divorce, when she was forced to move to the city to start a new life with her mother.
From then on, it seemed as though she had been blessed with good fortune by finding a good job and home of her own, where she could indulge her love of the countryside and animals once more. There were special romances along the way and so many parties and good times thrown in that she wondered if life could possibly get any better. What she hadnt considered was that life could actually get worsemuch worseand it did. 
Suddenly she was faced with uncertainty and had to question and understand what had happened and where her self-belief was. The person she had once been and the wonderful life she had once known had completely disappeared, and now she was left facing her biggest challenge yet. Could a hopeful heart be enough? It had to be; it was all she had." />
