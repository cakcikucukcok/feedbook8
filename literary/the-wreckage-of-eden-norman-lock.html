  <title>The Wreckage of Eden - Norman Lock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;EXTENSIVE CRITICAL ACCLAIM: Rave reviews for The American Novels series titles have appeared on NPR and in print and online outlets ranging from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times, Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Reader&#39;s Digest&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Flavorwire&lt;/i&gt;. They have garnered numerous starred reviews in trade publications and have been chosen for &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s &quot;Spotlight on Historical Fiction,&quot; &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s &quot;Top Indie Spring Fiction,&quot; and &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s &quot;Books of the Year.&quot; Two of the novels were also named Firecracker Award finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MASTERFUL WRITING: Lock has been widely praised for his style, including by NPR for novels that &quot;shimmer with glorious language, fluid rhythms, and complex insights,&quot; by &lt;i&gt;Shelf Awareness&lt;/i&gt; for writing &quot;the most deceptively beautiful sentences in contemporary fiction,&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; for prose that is &quot;crystalline and underline-worthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAGNIFICENT MIX OF FACT AND FICTION: Many readers and reviewers have lauded Lock for, as &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt; put it, his &quot;uncanny ability to inhabit historical figures and meticulously capture the vernacular of the time like a transcendentalist ventriloquist.&quot; Or, as a librarian and reader wrote about &lt;i&gt;A Fugitive in Walden Woods&lt;/i&gt;: &quot;So thoroughly does Lock set the mood that it is impossible to tell which words of Thoreau, Emerson, and Hawthorne are ones actually spoken or ones created by Lock.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG THEMES/BIG QUESTIONS: &lt;i&gt;The Wreckage of Eden&lt;/i&gt; is topical in its consideration of the persistence of war and violence, racial inequality, anti-Mexican sentiment, and a nation facing a profound turning point. Philosophically, it addresses big questions about freedom and its limitations, the dangers of political and religious orthodoxy, the nature of reality, and the use and virtues of art and storytelling. The narrator&#39;s interrogation of American ideals and the darkness he discovers at its heart will strike contemporary readers as relevant and urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HISTORIC CAST OF CHARACTERS: In addition to Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain), Abraham Lincoln, and John Brown, the novel prominently features Emily Dickinson as a lively character. The timelessness of Dickinson&#39;s poems is matched by the continued success of works about her writing and her life, exemplified by the recent film &lt;i&gt;A Quiet Passion&lt;/i&gt;. Lock explores themes in her poetry and the America of her time, tapping into the Dickinson mania in a way that will draw in the poet&#39;s many enduring fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONNECTED NOVELS: &lt;i&gt;The Wreckage of Eden&lt;/i&gt; is the fifth installment in Lock&#39;s American Novels series. Although each novel stands alone, fans of the cycle will enjoy discovering the subtle connections between them and the way Lock pays homage to major American literary figures and genres: first with Mark Twain and the coming-of-age adventure story in &lt;i&gt;The Boy in His Winter&lt;/i&gt;; then with Walt Whitman and the Western in &lt;i&gt;American Meteor&lt;/i&gt;; Edgar Allan Poe and the gothic psychological thriller in &lt;i&gt;The Port-Wine Stain&lt;/i&gt;; Henry David Thoreau and other famous transcendentalists and abolitionists in a marriage of slave narrative and pastoral drama in &lt;i&gt;A Fugitive in Walden Woods&lt;/i&gt;; and now with &lt;i&gt;The Wreckage of Eden&lt;/i&gt;, featuring Emily Dickinson in a lyrical lament of love and innocence lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also available by Norman Lock: Love Among the Particles | 9781934137642 | 14.95 | Bellevue Literary Press | 2013&lt;/p&gt;" />
