  <title>There’S a Storm Coming:  the Journey to Rescue and Save My Father - Kathryn Huddleston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In narrative form, this book chronicles the five-year journey the author took with her father, afflicted with Alzheimers, to restore his dignity and help him reach his physical, mental, and spiritual potential.  It presents the many obstacles, including the presence of evil forces and other family members mental disorders, which had to be overcome to accomplish this. The book illustrates how the common denominator of faith in God and a belief in His supreme will enabled communication with her father, with whom she previously had only limited interaction.  She came to discover the importance of entering her fathers world, of confirming his reality, and to recognize though parts of the brain may be tangled and even gone, the response to spirit and tone actually remains. Her fathers sensory awareness and understanding increased, and she challenges some previous stereotypes held about patients with this disease. Pragmatically, the author gives the caregiver suggestions on how to ensure the patients sense of accomplishment and purpose and maps out daily activity processes. The book illustrates how previous experiences enabled them to survive their storm, as the author relentlessly struggled to keep her father from being institutionalized so he could remain a participant in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, in a mans life, there is a book or manuscript that comes his way that is so far out of the norm and so deep beyond expectation that it requires thought, prayer, and time to assimilate the information through meditation. Theres a Storm Coming, Kathryn Huddlestons book on the subject of her fathers experience with Alzheimers disease and her passion to help him be the very best he could be physically, mentally and spiritually, is incredible. The journey with glimpses into the family life through the eyes of a person with medical insight, and ultimately, through a spiritual lens, allows us to take a peek behind the veil of one of the most difficult and tough situations facing many Americans today. This book is an incredible read for those who care about the condition of their fellow human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maury Davis, Senior Pastor, Cornerstone Church, Nashville, TN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God brings hope to us in stormy times. Through these dark years, compassion and care for loved ones is always first. This could not be more true than in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Center for Health Transformation, Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author captures the readers attention by recounting in narrative form how she attempted to overcome the many challenges and trials in her stormy family in order to lessen her fathers turbulence and bring him peace in the last phase of his life. In an unassuming, authentic way, the author illustrates how she ensured her father remained a valued participant in the world. Giving caregivers concrete ideas on how she helped her father make decisions, ensured up-close and personal interaction with others, and recognized the importance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of tone, spirit, and listening, the book should give them a sense of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Huddleston believes that while in the midst of other life storms God gave her the gift to care for her father. Here she shares that journey in a very personal, detailed, and honest fashion. Not only is this a wonderful handbook for the Alzheimers caregiver, Kathryns story affirms my experience of Gods daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;walk with those who appear to be absent. While we may see our loved ones as fading way, in reality, they may be living the old gospel hymn, Just a Closer Walk with Thee. This book gives the caregiver, or any reader, great spiritual hope.&lt;/p&gt;
