  <title>Undercover Angels - Angel P. Valdes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a how to inspirational book for all foster children who can read or can be read to by their foster parents, their therapists, their mentors, etc; to guide them in their emotional and spiritual quest for persons who can make them feel safe and loved, while they temporarily live in foster care or are waiting for adoptive parents. The purpose of this book is to help make foster children aware of what they can do for themselves to attract and stay close to loving and safe people who will guide them and encourage them as they get older and stronger emotionally. 
This book aims to support and validate the crucial role of foster parents and adoptive parents, and show appreciation for their labor of love and to motivate and inspire them to continue believing that their work is divine. 
Volunteers, social workers, therapists, guardian ad litems, teachers, counselors, mentors, parents, or anybody who is thinking about how to make a difference in this world by caring for and loving a child who needs a parent substitute, will be inspired as well. 
This book is especially designed as a guide for therapists who work with children in foster care, as it offers an opening for the discussion of issues relevant and important to the children. The utilization of the spiritual perspective is emphasized, to help children use it as another resource to cope with the intense emotions that the dismantling of their family creates in them. 
If we are to establish a lasting meaningful relationship with a child based on mutual respect and love, we need to first make the long term commitment and take the time to spend with a child, to give, to listen, to wipe the tears, to spend the money, the energy and the love, and to use the talents we have all been given by our Creator, to make the life of a child meaningful and worthy of Angels!
Update: The book is getting good reviews in the Child Welfare community." />
