  <title>The Mystery of Marie Rogêt - Edgar Allan Poe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mystery of Marie Rog&amp;ecirc;t is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the first murder mystery based on the details of a real crime. It first appeared in Snowden&amp;#39;s Ladies&amp;#39; Companion in three installments, November and December 1842 and February 1843. Poe&amp;#39;s detective character C. Auguste Dupin and his sidekick the unnamed narrator undertake the unsolved murder of Marie Rog&amp;ecirc;t in Paris.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The body of Rog&amp;ecirc;t, a perfume shop employee, is found in the Seine River and the press takes a keen interest in the mystery. Dupin remarks that the newspapers &amp;quot;create a sensation ... [rather] than to further the cause of truth&amp;quot;. Even so, he uses the newspaper reports to get into the mind of the murderer. Dupin uses his skills of ratiocination to determine that a single murderer was involved who dragged her by the cloth belt around her waist at first, then switching to a cloth around her neck, before dumping her body off a boat into the river. Finding the boat, Dupin suggests, will lead the police to the murderer." />
