  <title>One Layman’S Contemporary Theology - Michael S. K.  Toh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The credential of the author is based upon the fact that he is a trained psychologist, a biologist and a scientist; and has been in management/business fields for many years, having been exposed in all aspects of commerce and finance. He has a Master degree in Industrial Psychology from the University of Sydney, Bachelor of Science degree with a double major in psychology from Australian National University and a major in Biology from RMIT. Was awarded the &#39;Elizabeth and Martin Summit Prize in Psychology&#39;, an annual award given to the most outstanding student in Psychology at Sydney University. 
He has been teaching in a university for several years and was involved in politics for some time, but voluntarily chose to pursue a different path because of the incompatible sets of values that are required against what he believed in. 
He has a background of Buddhist and Confucian upbringing and was converted to being a follower of Jesus as a Catholic. However, he had been battling with what the churches taught and his knowledge and understanding in the fields of biology and psychology, new discoveries of physical sciences in which he was trained, against the background of his upbringing in a culture that was homogenous and has survived for more than 5000 years of history and his life experiences in the modern commercial materialistic world culture. 
He believes in doing Gods work in whatever circumstances he was placed, to be guided by the principles of what he believed Jesus has taught in establishing a consistent logical framework that is universal and more holistic, the result of which is the writing of this book. One of his greatest gifts is his ability to analyze things logically and he has been a good debater when he was at school. 
He has thus put all his thoughts down, gathered from his training, life experiences and his wide exposure in the modern world environment to establish an overall consistent logical framework in understanding the meaning of life in the order of things; and the role religion plays in assisting each individuals to achieve the universal objective of a salvation and the conflicts that are generated as a result of different derivatives of history and culture of the world." />
