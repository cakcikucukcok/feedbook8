  <title>Loveyoubye: Holding Fast, Letting Go, And Then There&#39;s The Dog - Rossandra White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Rossandra White walks into her Laguna Beach home one day to find that her husband of twenty-five years has disappeared-leaving behind only a cryptic, hastily written note on the kitchen counter as an explanation-she knows he&#39;ll come back. It&#39;s not the first time this has happened, and she trusts that their marriage, though tumultuous, will endure. But she soon learns that this time is different-and as new information comes to light, she realizes that the cracks in their relationship may have deepened past the point of repair.  In the midst of this turmoil, White&#39;s physically and mentally disabled younger brother needs her help. She returns to South Africa, land of her birth, to answer his call-and when she comes back to California, she finds that her dog Sweetpea, who for years has served as a vital emotional link between herself and her husband, has begun to succumb to a fatal illness. Ultimately, it is this core-rattling confluence of crises that forces White to face her own demons and make a decision: stay in a marriage that&#39;s crumbling before her eyes, or leave her husband and forge a new life for herself." />
