      <meta name="description" content="Teenager Marie Marcette knows shes in for the sweltering combination of heat and humidity of the local climate when her older brother wins tickets to a resort in the Philippines. She doesnt count on meeting hunky Julian Summers, a guy that instantly grabs her attention with his intelligence and polite, fun demeanor.&lt;p&gt; 
Maries surprise at the unexpected intensifies when the tour boat shes on crashes, and she and twelve others are stranded on a deserted island, cut off from civilization. Beyond the normal hunt for goods to sustain themselves, Marie, Julian, and the others must deal with a mysterious forest from which some fail to reemerge. What kind of evil resides there?&lt;p&gt; 
As members of the group vanish one by one, interpersonal struggles mount. With families broken, friendships strained, and love questioned, the remaining group members, including Marie and Julian, struggle to overcome their plight against the mysterious surrounding horrors. They bond together in a shaky truce, united in their quest for survival. As dreams start to fade and hope rapidly crumbles, their old lives become a thing of the past. How can Marie and the others escape the unknown horrors of The Island?" />
