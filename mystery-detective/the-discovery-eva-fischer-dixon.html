  <title>The Discovery - Eva Fischer-Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the height of her popularity Chava Diamond receives the tragic news of the passing of her beloved mother. To lay her beloved mother to rest, Chava must travel back to her native country, a task itself that she would rather not but she must do under the circumstances. In the company of her friend, she travels to Budapest, Hungary where she receives a letter from a strange man, written by her dying mother.   
In that letter, her mother reveals some disturbing details that until then were unknown to Chava. The letter describes the details of her mothers survival of the Holocaust and leaves three wishes for Chava to fulfill. While doing so, her journey takes her from Hungary to Poland and to Israel. On her journey to comply with her mothers final wishes, she discovers horrifying details of her familys past, present and perhaps even her own future. In Hungary she encounters a mysterious Palestinian man, Abdul, and in Poland she meets another handsome man, Avi who inadvertently draws her into the world of terrorism, kidnapping and romance.
Perhaps, just perhaps, her mothers final wishes were more than just for Chava to discover her familys past. Perhaps her mothers final wishes were for Chava discover something else, something that she was destined to discover for herself." />
