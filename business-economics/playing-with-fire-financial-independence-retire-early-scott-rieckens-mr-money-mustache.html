  <title>Playing with FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) - Scott Rieckens, Mr. Money Mustache</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;What if a happier life was only a few simple choices away?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A successful entrepreneur living in Southern California, Scott Rieckens had built a &amp;ldquo;dream life&amp;rdquo;: a happy marriage, a two-year-old daughter, a membership to a boat club, and a BMW in the driveway. But underneath the surface, Scott was creatively stifled, depressed, and overworked trying to help pay for his family&amp;rsquo;s beach-town lifestyle. Then one day, Scott listened to a podcast interview that changed everything. Five months later, he had quit his job, convinced his family to leave their home, and cut their expenses in half. Follow Scott and his family as they devote everything to FIRE (financial independence retire early), a subculture obsessed with maximizing wealth and happiness. Filled with inspiring case studies and powerful advice, &lt;em&gt;Playing with FIRE&lt;/em&gt; is one family&amp;rsquo;s journey to acquire the one thing that money can&amp;rsquo;t buy: a simpler &amp;mdash; and happier &amp;mdash; life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Based on the documentary&lt;/em&gt;" />
