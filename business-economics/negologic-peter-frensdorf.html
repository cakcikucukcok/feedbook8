  <title>NegoLogic - Peter Frensdorf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Negotiating releases the most basic feelings in us - we want to win, to come out on top, to be congratulated on getting one over on the opposition.   Well forget it. To win the money - every time - you have to forget your own feelings and leave the feel good emotion of winning to others. Instead you give your opponent the &#39;feeling&#39; of winning, because &#39;winning&#39; means nothing. It is a sensation you can switch on in others. Meanwhile you walk away with exactly what you came for.  NegoLogic presents practical psychological negotiating based on scientific research. When we are negotiating the details don&#39;t matter that much - the money is not important - but the way in which we reach the point of agreement, our skill in dealing with human interaction, is all important. You can make your opponent feel satisfied with the situation while you get the results you want - your price, your sale, your terms.   We all make decisions based on impulses yet we all look for a rational, &#39;valid&#39; explanation. So when you can implant in your opponent&#39;s mind an explanation that convinces them, they will be satisfied while you will be even more satisfied!  NegoLogic presents detailed, step-by-step routines to get what you want while keeping the opposition happy - in a whole range of examples. Peter Frensdorf details many, many techniques - including selecting the right opening bid, or reading the hidden meaning behind your opponent&#39;s bids and stances, or creating the right impulses in others (right for you that is).   So forget about winning negotiations - just take the money instead!  Peter Frensdorf is an autodidact negotiator, dealing for over thirty five years with companies like Adidas, Asics, Reebok, Puma, Kangaroos, Converse, Kappa, Wrangler, Diadora, FDB and Metro among others. It is a fair estimation that he has personally negotiated over ten thousand deals in that period as negotiation consultant or for his own companies." />
