  <title>The Letter - Jamuna Devi Advani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I reminisced about my 1940&#39;s childhood days in Jiribam, a remote place in the state of Manipur in North East India, I couldnt help but scribble all the memories which came flashing back to me like waves on the ocean. I have written about those memories in stories, in poems and in letter form to my nephew Gojen. Some of the names in my stories are fictitious as I reconstruct the stories, which I heard from my father and Uncle Chandrahas. Also I have included my journal entries since the time I had moved to Canada and later to USA revealing the trials and tribulations I had experienced during that time. Also writing is healing no doubt. Whatever the resentments I had accumulated during my growing up days about my father or any other individual is now gone permanently from my mind and I am at peace. In fact I see the positive sides of all the persons concerned. Hence I would like to encourage others who are in simliar situations, to write and enjoy the healing process." />
