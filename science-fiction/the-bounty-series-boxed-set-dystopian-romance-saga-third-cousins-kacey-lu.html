  <title>The Bounty Series - Boxed Set: Dystopian Romance Saga - Third Cousins, Kacey Lu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PART 1 - When the world government realized that the world was about to be damaged beyond repair, they had to take drastic action. A thousand years later and the last of the population are living without technology and under the strict regulations set by The City of Hope council. The problem is that nobody can fight back. Each person is required by law to have a chip inserted into them at birth. This chip can be deactivated at any time and once that happens, your life is deactivated with it.  There is a small fraction of people, though, who fight against The City of Hope. They are &quot;old worlders&quot;. They&#39;ve managed to hide for generations and can&#39;t be tracked, because they were never chipped. They&#39;re the reason that Sarah was forced to become a bounty hunter. They&#39;re the reason that the most important thing in her life was taken from her. When Sarah finds a huge camp of old worlders, she knows that she only needs one to finish paying of the council. But when she chooses to take a girl with wild hair and leave the rest, she doesn&#39;t realize that there&#39;s one man who will stop at nothing to get that girl back.  PART 2 - When Sarah is attacked by a wild animal, it&#39;s Natasha who saves her. So when Sarah gets an opportunity to make a switch, so that it isn&#39;t Natasha who gets handed into The City of Hope, she&#39;s willing to do it. But when Natasha refuses, Sarah finds herself in a difficult position. Nathan knows that it&#39;s his fault that Natasha has been taken, and he&#39;s willing to do everything he can to save her, but does that include betraying her?  PART 3 - Sarah finds herself making some difficult choices and having to pick between old friends and new. Will she take the side of the person who had always had hers or will she defend the one who can&#39;t defend himself? Nathan has had his opinion of Sarah turned on its head. He thought that she was a cold and heartless bounty hunter, but he&#39;s started to realize that there&#39;s a lot more to her than that. When he realizes that her mysteries are only making him fall for her harder, he knows he has an important choice to make. Will he let the government kill him or will he accept the chip that he&#39;s run from all his life?  PART 4 - Sarah has done everything that the council has asked of her. She&#39;s paid of her father&#39;s debt and now it&#39;s time that they hand him over. When she gets to the city and demands that he be released, she finds herself learning dark secrets about her father&#39;s past which make her question everything she has done. When her father is taken away from her again, she realizes that the council have lied to her, and when she realizes that Nathan isn&#39;t coming out to meet her, she knows there is only one person out there who will be able to help her.  PART 5 - Sarah knows that the guards are out looking for her. She knows that it&#39;s only a matter of time before they catch up, and that when they do, she might not be able to fight them all off. Natasha is close to finishing the device which will disconnect all the chips, but it&#39;s missing one vital piece. Will she be able to find it before it&#39;s too late? Nathan thought he was going to escape from the bunker. That was before Bella stopped him. Now he&#39;s stuck. The only contact with the outside world he can have is through monitoring people&#39;s chips. He tries to find comfort in watching over Sarah, but when he realizes that she&#39;s being attacked, he realizes that sitting on the sidelines is something he just can&#39;t do.  PART 6 - Sarah knows that if she wants to save Nathan, she&#39;s going to have to do it soon. Sirens from the city tell her that the chips are now inactive, but will that be enough to let her break into the city and get the man she loves back? The last thing Nathan was expecting was a rescue. He&#39;d be happy about it, too, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that Bella is going to get punished in his place. Will he be able to convince Natasha and Sarah to turn back and help her, or will her life be on his conscience forever?" />
