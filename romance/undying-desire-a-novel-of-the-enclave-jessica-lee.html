  <title>Undying Desire (A Novel of the Enclave) - Jessica Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Guerino Lombardi&#39;s world just went to shit. Vampire and second in command of the Warriors of the Enclave, he&#39;s put everything on the line to save his best friend from what has to be the worst blow a man can take. Kenric, his friend and master of the Enclave, has a daughter, something believed impossible in the vampire world, and word has it she wants her father and his Enclave dead. Guerin is determined to protect Kenric, keeping the secret from him until he knows for sure if this daughter really exists and if she wants revenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve Devonshire is a woman hiding in plain sight. Not completely human, but not quite a vampire, she&#39;s accepted by neither race but is more powerful than either one. Her life has consisted of half-truths and disguises, never belonging or living in one place for any length of time. But now some have heard rumors of her existence and want nothing more than to trap her and dissect her like a lab rat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay alive, Eve can&#39;t trust anyone, including the alpha vampire with midnight eyes and a thirst for pain and submission. With her enemies nipping at her heels, Eve has Guerin cornered, and both are determined to get the answers they&#39;re looking for or die trying...if they can fight their desires long enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contains hot alpha male vampires, including one with a taste for sexual submission that will lead to some highly charged erotic scenes involving anal, BDSM, various restraints, floggers, and whips.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The Enclave series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Undying Destiny&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Undying Embrace &lt;br&gt;Book #3 Undying Desire&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Undying Hunger&lt;/p&gt;" />
