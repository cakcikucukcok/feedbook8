  <title>Sarah - Orson Scott Card</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first book of bestselling author Orson Scott Card&#39;s Women of Genesis series--a unique re-imagining of the biblical tale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarai was a child of ten years, wise for her age but not yet a woman, when she first met Abram. He appeared before her in her father&#39;s house, filthy from the desert, tired and thirsty. But as the dirt of travel was washed from his body, the sight of him filled her heart. And when Abram promises Sarai to return in ten years to take her for his wife, her fate was sealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abram kept his promise, and Sarai kept hers. They were wed, and so joined the royal house of Ur with the high priesthood of the Hebrews. So began a lifetime of great joy together, and greater peril: and with the blessing of their God, a great nation would be built around the core of their love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Orson Scott Card uses his fertile imagination, and uncanny insight into human nature, to tell the story of a unique woman--one who is beautiful, tough, smart, and resourceful in an era when women had little power, and are scarce in the historical record. Sarah, child of the desert, wife of Abraham, takes on vivid reality as a woman desirable to kings, a devoted wife, and a faithful follower of the God of Abraham, chosen to experience an incomparable miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Women of Genesis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rebekah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rachel and Leah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Sarah - Orson Scott Card</i></b> | I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card since his Ender Game series. If you're expecting the thrill of his sci-fi/fantasy genre, this is not the same Orson Scott Card. However, I enjoyed it all the same. Card wrote a series of novels focusing on the matriarchs of Genesis. This is his first in the series about Abraham's wife, Sarah.<br /><b><i>Sarah (Women of Genesis, #1) by Orson Scott Card</i></b> | From New York Times bestselling author Orson Scott Card comes the finely crafted novel of Sarah, about a beautiful and courageous Jewish woman who changed the course of history through her faith, wisdom, and commitment to her husband, Abraham. As a man writing from a woman's perspective, Card nevertheless shows great perspicacity.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Sarah (Women of Genesis, Book 1 ...</i></b> | Orson Scott Card is well-known for his science fiction novels, especially Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1). Now he ventures into the stories of women of the Bible. Card himself states, "Women did not show up much in historical records." The book is a retelling of the biblical story of Sarah, wife of Abram.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Sarah - Orson Scott Card</a> </h3></p><hr/>
