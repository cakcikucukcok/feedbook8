  <title>The Other Side of the Vent - Helen C. Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In January 2009, who would have thought our familys lives would be turned upside down. This book is a true story of the struggle of a young woman, her family, and friends to deal with a potentially deadly syndrome called ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). This book will bring you along their journey with laughter and tears, showing you how a sense of humor can help any situation. This story will have you on the edge of your seats as the journey unfolds before you. There are many important points in this book, but the most important is that God is always with you, in good times and testing times. When your life is hanging by its last thread, the love of your family, friends, and most importantly, God will carry you through, no matter what the outcome may be. People in a coma can hear you, and what you say or do affects their outcome. Remember to think, pray, and speak positively in the hearing range of the coma patient. It will help everyone immensely. Enjoy the book." />
