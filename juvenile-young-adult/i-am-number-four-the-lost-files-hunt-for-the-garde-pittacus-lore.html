  <title>I Am Number Four: The Lost Files: Hunt for the Garde - Pittacus Lore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this villainous one-hundred-page companion novella to the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling I Am Number Four series, get a unprecedented look at the invasion&amp;#8212;from three different Mogadorians hoping to conquer Earth. This novella picks up immediately after the cliffhanger ending of &lt;em&gt;The Fate of Ten &lt;/em&gt;and coincides with the events of &lt;em&gt;United as One&lt;/em&gt;, the final book in this epic series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Mogadorian leader is struck with a potentially fatal blow, it becomes uncertain who will step in for him and how the Mogs should proceed with their invasion of the planet. This power vacuum has wide-reaching ramifications. One Mog, who has been on a quest for redemption ever since she first let the Garde slip through her fingers, is given an unimaginable opportunity to make things right with the Beloved Leader. Another, who has an unquenchable thirst for blood, jumps at the opportunity to hunt down the human teens who have begun to develop Legacies. And the last Mog, who has been questioning everything since he crossed paths with Adam, is forced to decide once and for all where his allegiances lie. While the fate of the Mogadorian leader is unknown, the one thing that is for certain is that this war is coming to an end . . . and there can only be one side that wins.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
