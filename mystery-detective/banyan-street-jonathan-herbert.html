  <title>Banyan Street - Jonathan Herbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was the last day of his freshman year at college when Butch Sands received the bad news about his father. James Sands was found floating face down in the mangroves on Pedro Island, near the Southwest Florida coastline. The authorities claim it was a fishing accident.
But Butch isnt convinced. His gut tells him that James, a journalist, was murdered due to a recent story involving illegal labor practices in Miami; Butch has no idea of the dangers he must face to find the truth. Those closest to him insist that the matter be closedespecially when Butchs accusations focus on a popular and powerful local businessman and philanthropist.
As Butch searches for answers, an unexpected hurricane leads him to newfound romance and a chance encounter with a fifth generation fisherman seeking a similar truth ignored by island residents for years. As fortunes change, Butch is forced to make a decision that will change his life forever." />
