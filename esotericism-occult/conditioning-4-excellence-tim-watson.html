  <title>Conditioning-4-Excellence - Tim Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When your name is called, are you ready for &quot;Showtime?&quot;  Are you ready to start &quot;Conditioning-4-Excellence?&quot; Get prepared to take your performance, business, and personal life to a level you never thought you would reach!  Having enjoyed some notable academic, athletic, and entrepreneurial accomplishments in his life, retired NFL player, Lifestyle Coach, Business Consultant, and Motivational Speaker Tim Watson is sharing successful anecdotes from the classroom, field, and life in this semi-autobiographical must read!
We must clearly identify our INSPIRATIONS in order to achieve our ASPIRATIONS.  This statement is the premise to any true success.  Without personally defined motivation, it will be impossible to reach and sustain accomplishments of any real value.  This is the only means by which we are able to persevere through challenges and doubt.
Intrinsically we are not wired to navigate through and beyond extreme challenge.  Our natural tendency is to cease effort when the obstacle appears insurmountable.  This book shares principles which address the proper nurturing needed in our Minds, Bodies, and Spirits in order to reach beyond mediocrity and LIVE EXTRAORDINARILY in relationships, careers, fitness, and finances!" />
