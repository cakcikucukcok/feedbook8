      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dealt with the Propulsion System and was the main area of study for Lazar.  The following fields of study were available to him in briefing form only.  He was taken to the briefing room and told to study reports about propulsion and the role of gravity as the propulsion medium. Harnessing, amplifying, and lensing the basic Gravity &#39;A-wave has many other possibilities.  The following 2 other projects were presented to Lazar in briefing form.  Since he found the reports pertaining to his hands-on field of study to be accurate, he had to assume the other 2 projects were accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Sidekick:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealt with a beam weapon potential of the craft and the attempt to prototype one.

When I first began at S4, I would randomly be taken into a small room which contained a table, a chair, and 120-or-so briefings in blue folders. I&#39;d be left there to read for varying amounts of time, usually about half-an-hour.  These briefings contained a wide spectrum of information, mostly relating to aliens and alien technology.  These reports appeared to be an overview of alien information which could be used to brief scientists from any field about the scope of the whole project and not just their specific field of endeavor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
