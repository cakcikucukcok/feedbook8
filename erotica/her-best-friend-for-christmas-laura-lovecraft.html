  <title>Her Best Friend For Christmas - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While visiting her best friend, Holly during spring break, Heather witnesses two girls enjoying each other. Heather not only becomes aroused at the sight, but can&#39;t seem to get it out of her mind. As time passes she becomes more and more interested, but is too shy and nervous to approach a woman.
Horny and frustrated, the only person Heather has confided to about her secret fantasy is Holly. Holly has always been into women and tries to encourage Heather to explore her desires, but to no avail. It&#39;s now the night before Christmas Eve and, as is their tradition, the two girls spend the night together at Heather&#39;s house to exchange gifts. 
But this year is going to be very different as Holly has decided to give Heather two special gifts. One, the gift of her body as she shows Heather just how much fun two girls can have together. The second one, however is even more important as Holly has a secret of her own she is about to reveal; that she has been in love with Heather and wants to give her much more than her body for Christmas!
