  <title>Wicked Castle - Jenna Bora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There goes the roaring sound of the gunfire, the sharp clang of one sword clashing with another. These were some of the noises that could be heard by an observer of this war. It was the second Knights vs. Warriors War in Siennas history. Anyone who had observed the first war would say that this one has the terror and viciousness of the first one multiplied by five. The first Knights vs. Warriors War happened from 1977 to 1982. It ended with a victory for the Warriors. The second one started in 1992 and ended in 1996.
While this war took the lives of about five thousand innocent people, out of them all, these four were the most noteworthy: Gwyneth and Oliver Hardly and Helene and Richard Woodley. These were the parents of Julianna Hardly and Fae Woodley. Due to this fatal day, Julianna and Fae would never know the life they could have had. But those who know them personally would be certain that if they hadnt fallen into being adopted by the king and queen of Sienna, they never would have met. But because of their vastly different outlooks on life, that would not necessarily be a bad thing. It would make life much more peaceful for their adoptive parents too. But none of that is important anymore.
Now its time to enter the life and meet the parents that they do have.
