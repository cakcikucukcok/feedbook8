  <title>Deathworld - Harry Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deathworld is the name of a series of science fiction novels by Harry Harrison including the books Deathworld (first published 1960, serialized in Astounding Science Fiction), Deathworld 2 (1964, initially titled The Ethical Engineer and serialized in Analog) and Deathworld 3 (1968, serialized in Analog as The Horse Barbarians), plus the short story &amp;quot;The Mothballed Spaceship&amp;quot; (1973, written as part of a tribute to John W. Campbell). The central hero is a gambler who becomes involved with colonists of an extremely hostile planet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several hints that the novels take place in the same universe as Harrison&amp;#39;s The Stainless Steel Rat series; however, other hints suggest a similar universe but not exactly the same one. For example, at several points in the Deathworld series, the novels mention the Special Corps with Inskipp as its leader; however, the story &amp;quot;The Mothballed Spaceship&amp;quot; mentions an armada about to attack Earth--a planet that is long destroyed in the time of The Stainless Steel Rat universe." />
