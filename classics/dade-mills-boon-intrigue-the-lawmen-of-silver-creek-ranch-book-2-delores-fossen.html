  <title>Dade (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Lawmen of Silver Creek Ranch, Book 2) - Delores Fossen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Kayla Brennan doesn&#39;t want Texas lawman Dade Ryland&#39;s protection. For one thing, his family hates her. For another, the attraction between them is too hot to handle–just like Dade. When the bullets begin to fly, Dade shields her and her baby boy. But the question is, how long before Dade decides she&#39;s in on the crime?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kayla&#39;s testimony is all Dade should want…especially since he suspects Kayla was involved in the death of a Ryland family member. Yet the fact that they&#39;re enemies only makes the animal attraction between them stronger. And more dangerous. For the killer is not who he seems, and is far closer than Dade ever imagined….&lt;/p&gt;
