  <title>Prelude to a Christmas Carol - Teresa L. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;There were four individuals with a plan, two men released from a Sanitarium, two others farthest from wealth, all in need of a Christmas miracle.&lt;BR&gt;Their plan was to change the future of one man, Ebenezer Scrooge. Some may have had their reasons,but none as good as the brother in law of Ebenezer Scrooge, Charles. After Charles wife dies giving birth to their son, he becomes lost in a world without her. Charles sisters think him insane, release him to a sanitarium and take his son, Fred, to raise until Charles is well again. At Williams Sanitarium, Charles falls into a deep delirium and wakes seventeen years later to the cries of a child. Charles feels the guilt of a father who longs for his son, along with his bodys addiction to the drug laudanum and the fear of possibly falling into that same delirium again. Charles befriends the largest man hes ever seen,named John. A man who has his own demons to deal with. Charles is given back his past, by reading letters his sisters had sent him spanning the last seventeen years he had lost. Both men become mesmerized by the letters as the sisters tell of Freds childhood to adulthood and Ebenezers wrath on humankind.  Because of overcrowding,both men are released from Williams Sanitarium. Charles returns to the home he once knew, which brings him memories of his wifes death and the whispers of her ghost.  Charles feels suchhostility toward Ebenezer for his hatefulness towardshis son Fred. Charles concocts a plan, and enlists the help of Peter Cratchit and the child of Ebenezers old love. All help in the redemption of Ebenezer Scrooge. Not everything would go according to plan, but the evening&#39;s spectacular events branded the hearts and souls of more than just Ebenezer." />
