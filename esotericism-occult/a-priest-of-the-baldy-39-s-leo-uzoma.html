As a child he was not accepted by the other kids, he was called names like the voodoo king, vampire child, baldie e.t.c just because of his power. As an adult, he had no friends.While his sibling enjoys life as a teenager exploiting all that he could he isolated himself from people in other not to be singled out and humiliated. He preferred total solitary. His dreams kept his hope alive that maybe, just maybeone day there will come a new Raphae.
