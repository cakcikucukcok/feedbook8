      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Nick Blacksheep was an outsider to all: the police force, his community and the women he kept at arm&#39;s length. Experienced in modern warfare, the tall Navajo&#39;s imposing spirit recalled the intensity of his ancestors. His heart incapable of wounding, Nick was the fiercest protector beautiful Drew Simmons could have ever imagined–or desired.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With contract killers on her tail, the small-town librarian needed a cop who was true to his word. Though Blacksheep promised to safeguard Drew, he couldn&#39;t have expected her compassion to thaw the ice in his veins. Now his greatest duty isn&#39;t to himself, but the woman he welcomed into his home.&lt;/p&gt;
