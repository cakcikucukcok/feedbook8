  <title>Jesus Victory of God V2: Christian Origins And The Question Of God - N. T. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this highly anticipated volume, N. T. Wright focuses directly on the historical Jesus: Who was he? What did he say? And what did he mean by it?&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wright begins by showing how the questions posed by Albert Schweitzer a century ago remain central today. Then he sketches a profile of Jesus in terms of his prophetic praxis, his subversive stories, the symbols by which he reordered his world, and the answers he gave to the key questions that any world view must address. The examination of Jesus&amp;#39; aims and beliefs, argued on the basis of Jesus&amp;#39; actions and their accompanying riddles, is sure to stimulate heated response. Wright offers a provocative portrait of Jesus as Israel&amp;#39;s Messiah who would share and bear the fate of the nation and would embody the long-promised return of Israel&amp;#39;s God to Zion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
