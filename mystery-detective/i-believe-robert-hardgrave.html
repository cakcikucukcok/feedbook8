  <title>I Believe - Robert Hardgrave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wounded by a painful divorce, life is slowly shifting into mere existence for Bill, a retired teacher in Anchorage, Alaska. Lonely and depressed, he moves into a retirement community to await the inevitable. But it seems that fate has more in store for Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is convinced that he will never find love again; he is happy to be proven wrong, however, when he meets Gail. In the summer of 2012, to celebrate their one-year anniversary, they fly to up to the beautiful, calm, blue waters of Katchemak Bay for a romantic weekend getaway in his small plane. But several hundred miles into the trip, above the unforgiving Canadian wilderness, the plane loses power with no landing strip in sight. Now, Bill and Gail wait for another kind of inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battered but alive, they must now fight to survive. In the fierce challenges of wilderness life, they grow even closer. Hour by hour, what was once a comfortable relationship flourishes into something much more meaningful. In the face of terror, their bond grows even tighter. And in the wilderness, they will encounter more dangers than Gail is prepared to expect. In Bill, Gail finds her knight, and in Gail, Bill finds his lady. As beautiful as a fresh spring flower, their love finds a way to blossom in the harshest of environments. In their faith, they never lose hope that God will deliver them safely from their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
