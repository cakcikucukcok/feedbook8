      <meta name="description" content="Follow this gripping saga - Book 1: Cassie is a popular girl and she knows it. In fact, when she’s asked to define the person that she is for her school yearbook, she ends up choosing that very word. But popularity can be a fickle thing. When Cassie starts to learn this, she realizes that everything she had built for herself is about to coming crashing down around her. Book 2: Cassie’s moved on from high school and into everything that comes with college. She’s lost interest in the parties and the popularity race that comes with the party scene. In fact she’d much prefer to spend some quiet time with her new friend Sam rather than party the night away, but when he pushes for some fun and her ex Eric seeks her out, she finds herself being pulled into a world that she thought she’d escaped forever. Book 3: Messing around with her ex has gotten Cassie into trouble. So why is she still doing it? When Cassie starts to realize what’s really important she knows that she’s already left it for too long. But is that going to stop her from trying?" />
