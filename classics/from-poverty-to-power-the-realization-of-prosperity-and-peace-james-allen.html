  <title>From Poverty to Power: The Realization of Prosperity and Peace - James Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is James Allen&#39;s first book, published in 1901. It was also titled The Realization of Prosperity and Peace. Allen described this book as &quot;A Book for all those who are in search of better conditions, wider freedom, and increased usefulness.&quot;
This book appeals to the reader from his own standpoint, and indicates the line of development along which each one should work in order to accomplish the greatest amount of lasting good. Enduring success in any direction is shown to be the result of inward adjustment and growth. Each may accelerate his own progress by silently, but effectively harmonizing his mental forces, the good effects of which will soon become manifest in improved circumstances, and wider opportunities.
This Book is suitable for men and women in all circumstances, stations, and conditions of life. The Truth is so presented in its pages as to render it adaptable to all minds. Numbers of business men have pro?ted largely by reading it, while those sacking the highest Truth have entered into larger light and greater peace by studying its chapters." />
