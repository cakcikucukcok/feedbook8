  <title>How to Be a Supervillain: Born to Be Good - Michael Fry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this highly anticipated follow-up to the bestselling How to Be a Supervillain, Victor Spoil must save the world from an evil scheme to enslave the superheroes and villains -- to his parents&#39; utter disappointment.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A sequel has never been this good . . . at being bad! Victor Spoil hates the Junior Super Academy. It makes him cranky -- and his parents couldn&#39;t be prouder, because supervillains aren&#39;t meant to be nice. Until Victor confesses he wants to leave and become a librarian. The horror! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But when superheroes and villains -- including his parents -- start disappearing, only a dedicated do-gooder like Victor can track them down. He discovers that the supers are being captured to square off against aliens in gladiator-like shows. And unlike the scripted fights that the supers usually sign up for, these battles are to the death! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Victor and his fellow super students must join together and harness their super powers to battle this dastardly mega-villain. But to be a hero, Victor finally has to embrace his inner villain. Will he be able to stoop that low?" />
