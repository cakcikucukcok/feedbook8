  <title>The Golden Rule - Gary Levey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fourteen-year-old Gil Rose has already learned that when life asks him to make difficult choices, he must always do what is right. After his father informs him that his great-grandfather, Bernard Rosenthal, has been in hiding and is now electing to opt out of life, he asks Gil to travel to his grandfathers bedside and persuade him to live. The future of both their careers may be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has been forever changed by events during the first half of the twenty-first century. After the 2032 election, a powerful senator is elected president and dictates the country straight into a world where everythingincluding life and deathis controlled by corporate string pullers who force humans to surrender free will in exchange for comfort and virtual pleasures. After Gil visits his grandfather, he learns family secrets that cause him to face the reality of the cruel and inhumane world he inhabits. As he uncovers the presidents evil plot, he must struggle to free himself and those around him from the bondage of greed, ego, and power, taking up a quest to shun selfishness and restore freedom and greatness to America.&lt;/p&gt;
