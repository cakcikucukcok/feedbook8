And sultans who are so dumb, it borders on insanity. In this world women suffer and men just get lucky. For a woman to succeed, she has to be a 1001 times more clever than any man.<br /><b><i>Arabian Nights by Anonymous - Goodreads</i></b> | What you thought was the Arabian Nights was more likely Richard Burton's bastardized, inflated 19th-century adaptation, which was as much about Richard Burton (and his weird ideas about sex) as it was about Arabia. Which is sortof neither here nor there; there is no canonical version of Arabian Nights anyway.<br /><b><i>The Arabian Nights by Anonymous - Goodreads</i></b> | Enjoy the timeless tales of Aladdin, Sinbad, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and many more in this first volume of The Arabian Nights. Upon learning of his queen’s infidelity, proud King Shahryar has her killed. As revenge on womankind, he decides to wed a different virgin every night, only to have her beheaded at dawn.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Arabian Nights - Anonymous</a> </h3></p><hr/>
