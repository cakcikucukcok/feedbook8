  <title>Power to the People - Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A guided tour of a revolution in the making that promises to change our lives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global warming, rolling black outs, massive tanker spills, oil dependence: our profligate ways have doomed us to suffer such tragedies, right?  Perhaps, but Vijay Vaitheeswaran, the energy and environment correspondent for &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;, sees great opportunity in the energy realm today, and &lt;i&gt;Power to the People&lt;/i&gt; is his fiercely independent and irresistibly entertaining look at the economic, political, and technological forces that are reshaping the world&#39;s management of energy resources. In it, he documents an energy revolution already underway--a revolution as radical as the communications revolution of the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the corporate boardroom of a Texas oil titan who denies the reality of global warming to a think tank nestled in the Rocky Mountains where a visionary named Amory Lovins is developing the kind of hydrogen fuel-cell technology that could make the internal combustion engine obsolete, Vaitheeswaran gamely pursues the people who hold the keys to our future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man&#39;s quest for energy is insatiable. It is also essential. By avoiding the traditional binaries that pit free markets against the wisdom of conservation and the need for clean energy, &lt;i&gt;Power to the People&lt;/i&gt; is a book that debunks myths without debunking hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
