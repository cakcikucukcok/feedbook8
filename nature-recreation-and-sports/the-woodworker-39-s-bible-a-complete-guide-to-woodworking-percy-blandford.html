  <title>The Woodworker&#39;s Bible: A Complete Guide to Woodworking - Percy Blandford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Woodworking is Timeless&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things change, to be sure, and woodworking is no exception. New tools come on the market, older tools are upgraded and a number of new, finely made hand tools are now available. Regardless of the subtle changes, the basic principles used by woodworkers have remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novice woodworker can produce satisfactory work following these unchanging woodworking traditions and using just some basic tools. Once these lessons are learned, all woodworking tasks are only a short step away. Power tools can take much of the drudgery out of woodworking, hand tools bring you closer to your work to teach you the characteristics of wood and how to make the most of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book offers all the knowledge needed to get started in woodworking. All of the joints, jigs, methods, techniques and processes that have stood the test of time are included (along with a number of basic projects to practice the techniques). Woodworking offers enough variety to satisfy the widest range of tastes and inclinations. Let this book be your guide for whatever direction you want your work to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
