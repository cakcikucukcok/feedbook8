  <title>Healing: a Conversation - Annette Cravera Goggio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Desperately ill with a brain infection, Ms. Goggio begins a review of her life. Each morning before waking, she finds herself observing a particular time, a particular place in which she views with remorse events that unfold before her eyes. From that review comes a word or phrase that she knows she must write down, so she does, and the conversation begins. She hears a voice talking to her, and she responds, never knowing where the conversation is heading, never editing the words or questioning them, just writing them down. She comes to understand that the voice is her Guidance, Jonathan, the soul from the other realm that created her and watches over her, life after life, guiding her to her best being, her best learning as a soul. This illness is a life lesson, he says, and he imparts to her the pathway to healing. A pathway for everyone. She knows she must follow it, however difficult, to achieve redemption, the redeeming of her energetic, physical and spiritual self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Part story, part self-help book, Healing: A Conversation shines a bright light on the &quot;mystery&quot; of illness and healing. Her honest revelations and heartfelt insights into her own illness give readers hope and permission to examine their own life story. This remarkable book breaks new ground in its account of healing as a platform for understanding the greatest aspects of life, that of relationships, life purpose and the intentional education of the soul.
