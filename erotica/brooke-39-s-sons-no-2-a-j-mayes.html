  <title>Brooke&#39;s Sons No.2 - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Brooke begins the second part of her story by leading Fred down to the dungeon, and with the twins help, he gives her what she needs. And unable to stop herself, Brooke continues the incestuous affair with Chase and Tanner. Later, Amber and Tiff join them, and Fred, Brooke, and the twins introduce the girls to the world of BDSM. Over the next few days, Brooke explores pain and sex with the twins, Amber, Tiff, and Fred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pouring cocoa into Christmas mugs, Chase looked up. &amp;ldquo;Aw, mom&amp;hellip; you look nice&amp;ndash;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But we can&amp;rsquo;t see anything,&amp;rdquo; Tanner said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just making you wait for it.&amp;rdquo; Brooke smiled and dropping the cashmere to the floor, spun on her heels. &amp;ldquo;Is this more what you had in mind, boys?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;God, yes.&amp;rdquo; Chase&amp;rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he looked at his mom&amp;rsquo;s body, and loving the sheer fabric leaving little to the imagination, shook his head. &amp;ldquo;Fuck me &amp;hellip; you look fantastic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, mom &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re fucking hot,&amp;rdquo; Tanner said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Glad you like &amp;hellip; but if I&amp;rsquo;m only wearin&amp;rsquo; this, I gotta sit by the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Go get warm, we&amp;rsquo;ll bring the cocoa,&amp;rdquo; Chase said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the marshmallows,&amp;rdquo; Brooke purred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moving to the fire. Brooke kicked her boots off, and throwing a blanket over the leather chair, curled her legs under her on the wool, enjoying the flames warming her skin. The twins walked in, and handing her a mug, Tanner said, &amp;ldquo;Careful, mom &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s really hot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thanks, son. Please, throw another log on the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After settling in chairs next to hers, the twins and Brooke stayed quiet, a few minutes, relishing the closeness while they sipped the cocoa. Draining his mug, Chase said, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re really happy for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, mom &amp;hellip; Fred&amp;rsquo;s the right man,&amp;rdquo; Tanner said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I think so too &amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m glad you approve. Fred asked to take me to dinner tonight. He wants to go on a few dates before we buy rings. Can you boys survive without me for a couple of hours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. You two need to be together without sex involved.&amp;rdquo; Chase touched Brooke&amp;rsquo;s arm. &amp;ldquo;That means you can&amp;rsquo;t play with his dick under the table, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Or fuck him in the car before you even go into the restaurant,&amp;rdquo; Tanner said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Damn. You mean I can&amp;rsquo;t play with Fred at all &amp;hellip; no sex &amp;lsquo;til we get home?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep &amp;hellip; you have to be good,&amp;rdquo; Chase said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And tonight, Chase and I are off limits.&amp;rdquo; Tanner caressed Brooke&amp;rsquo;s cheek. &amp;ldquo;You and Fred should be alone when you make love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But I get you boys today, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, mom &amp;hellip; Tanner and I will fuck you all you want. And we still wanna join you and Fred, just not tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love you both so much.&amp;rdquo; Tears welling up in her eyes, Brooke brushed them away. &amp;ldquo;No mom could ever ask for better sons &amp;hellip; make love to me, boys.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
