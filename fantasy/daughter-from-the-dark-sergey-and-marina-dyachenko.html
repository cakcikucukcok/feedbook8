  <title>Daughter from the Dark - Sergey and Marina Dyachenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this extraordinary stand-alone novel, the authors and translator of &lt;em&gt;Vita Nostra&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;a &quot;dark Harry Potter on steroids with a hefty dose of metaphysics&quot; (award-winning author Aliette de Bodard)&amp;#8212;return with a story about creation, music, and companionship filled with their hallmark elements of subtle magic and fantasy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late one night, fate brings together DJ Aspirin and ten-year-old Alyona. After he tries to save her from imminent danger, she ends up at his apartment. But in the morning sinister doubts set in. Who is Alyona? A young con artist? A plant for a nefarious blackmailer? Or perhaps a long-lost daughter Aspirin never knew existed? Whoever this mysterious girl is, she now refuses to leave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A game of cat-and-mouse has begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claiming that she is a musical prodigy, Alyona insists she must play a complicated violin piece to find her brother. Confused and wary, Aspirin knows one thing: he wants her out of his apartment and his life. Yet every attempt to get rid of her is thwarted by an unusual protector: her plush teddy bear that may just transform into a fearsome monster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alyona tells Aspirin that if he would just allow her do her work, she&amp;#8217;ll leave him&amp;#8212;and this world. He can then return to the shallow life he led before her. But as outside forces begin to coalesce, threatening to finally separate them, Aspirin makes a startling discovery about himself and this ethereal, eerie child. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
