          &lt;strong&gt;Escape from obsession!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ebony is an Australian supermodel. She is also Alan Carstairs&#39;s ward. Once they were close, but now it is no secret in Sydney&#39;s glamorous fashion world that Ebony and Alan are openly hostile toward each other. Why? What nobody knows is that Ebony and Alan are caught up in an obsession for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, both can no longer bear the pain of their all-consuming passion, and each has a plan to break free. Ebony intends to leave Alan, while he is determined to make her pay for those years of tortured desire. But sometimes a bitter end leads to a new beginning… and where there is hatred, there can be love… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
