  <title>Last Message from Nibiru - Grover Bentley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2112: corporations have become nations and the human race has colonized the solar system. But the one thing humanity didnt count on, was Nibiru parking itself in orbit around Earth. 
Nibiru and the Annunaki have come back to Earth to finish the job they had started so long ago, or so everyone thought. When the planet parked itself in orbit and nothing happened, people began to wonder. 
Sending in a team of field experts with a battle-hardened marine detachment, humanity finally learns the truth about Nibiru. The reason nothing happened was because the entire population was dead and extremely hungry. 
Fighting for their lives and constantly on the run, the team slowly begins to reveal the secrets of Nibiru, and with it, the knowledge that the flesh eating locals are the least of their worries" />
