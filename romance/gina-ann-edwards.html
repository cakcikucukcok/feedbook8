  <title>Gina - Ann Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its been seven years since the love of her life betrayed her, and Gina still cant trust her heart to another man. Her familys attorney, Matt Larson, is in love with her, but he knows that she still isnt ready for a commitment, so he guards his emotions carefullyuntil Gina tries to fix him up with her best friend! Stunned by the absurdity of the situation, he decides to let her latest brainstorm simply run its course.&lt;br /&gt;
His plan completely falls to pieces when Hurricane Sandy comes ashore and devastates his Lower Manhattan neighborhood. Surrounded by so much tragedy, lives lost, homes destroyed, hopes and dreams shattered, Matt promises himself that he will not go on indefinitely hoping for Ginas heart to heal. Either he breaches the wall shes built around her emotions, and soon, or he walks out of her life forever. In the end, its a choice that an assailants knife makes for him." />
