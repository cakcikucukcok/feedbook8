  <title>“The First Resurrection”—Who Will Be in It? Or, the Main Purpose for Human Life! - Richard Kenney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book started out as a thirty-twopage 8.5 x 11 Bible study/article about ten years ago (approximately 2006), which I wrote and printed up myself at home for the various groups I was teaching at the time. I inserted each of the pages into clear plastic page protectors and then mounted them into standard loose-leaf binders. Then, as time passed, I started telling myself, Theres so much more to this study thats not in this writing. So I went about to write another study/article of fifteen 8.5 x 11 pages concerning the time right close to the time Jesus Christ would actually return, then subsequently this full-length book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about the main subject Christ told his followers to teach to the whole worldthe Gospel of the kingdom of God and the many aspects pertaining to it. There are many questions. When will Christ return? Will we go to heaven or stay here on earth? Will the dead really be resurrected? Were living in the very last days now! Events will happen thatll affect everyone! There will be such calamities that will affect the sun, moon, and stars! Where will the battle of Armageddon be staged? This book has the answers to these questions and more. We need to stay close to God now more than ever! The best way to be prepared is to educate yourself by reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
