  <title>Tango Midnight - Michael Cassutt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 2005, and the world has changed.  International terrorists have released a genetically modified disease, called X-Pox, on the world.  There is no greater challenge to medicine than finding a cure.   Biochem billionaire Tad Mikleszewski (called TM by nearly everyone) is a &quot;space junkie&quot; who has been the primary investor backing the Spacelifter project, a private attempt to build a single-stage to orbit vehicle.  But Spacelifter&#39;s crucial test firing has failed, and TM is going to pull the plug.  He has a better idea for getting himself into space....he&#39;ll buy research time on the International Space Station, to work on a cure for X-Pox.  The Russians will sell him a seat on the Soyuz taxi vehicle for a mere $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the equipment in the Harmony Laboratory module was salvaged from old Russian military labs, and perhaps TM&#39;s skills are a little bit out of date.  A tiny leak - a small hole in the seal of the isolation box where TM is manipulating the X-Pox pathogen, and Harmony is contaminated by the  disease that kills within three weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s a race against time, to rescue the crew and decontaminate the Space Station.  NASA has a shuttle a month from launch, and if Astronaut Kelly Gessner can be retrained in decontamination procedures they can push that up two weeks.  The Russians have a third Soyuz due off the assembly line, but Astronaut Mark Koskinen, NASA&#39;s chief of staff at Star City doesn&#39;t think they&#39;ll make it in time.  But whether Russian or American, someone is going to have to get up there, and fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
