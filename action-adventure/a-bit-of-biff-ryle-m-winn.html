  <title>A bit of Biff - Ryle M Winn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Biff McLeod is unorthodox,laid-back and deceptively eagle-eyed. His humour is original. Take his quirky description of a bar fight - &lt;em&gt;sounds like a short-sighted hippo trying to root a rhino in a glass factory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Anika, his accomplished kick-boxing partner from Melbourne, they take on the drug scene, picking up clues in unlikely places from Brisbane to Cairns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s Ugly Dougie, known for wrapping barbed wire around his victims and feeding them to the crabs. And Kelly, ex-midshipman bar owner who knows the street scene and passes info to Biff - for a price. Then there&amp;#39;s Gordo, the used car salesman by day and brothel boss by night, along with MaryLou, the prostitute with secrets. Nasty ones. And many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incredibly fast paced with a big cast woven through a tapestry of cold-blooded murder, shootouts, knife fights, suicide. Twists and turns, big semi-trailers and little towtrucks, car chases, prostitutes, pimps, mules and stand-over men - it&amp;#39;s all here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the most hilarious sex scene ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not forgetting Bozo, Biff&amp;#39;s dog.&lt;/p&gt;" />
