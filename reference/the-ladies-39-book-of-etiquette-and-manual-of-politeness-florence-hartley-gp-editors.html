  <title>The Ladies&#39; Book of Etiquette and Manual of Politeness - Florence Hartley, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If the correct rules of etiquette fail you, never fear for this handy guide will instruct you in the correct ladylike manner! This indispensable nineteenth century guidebook will entertain, educate and inspire in equal measure. What should you do if you notice a stranger&amp;rsquo;s dress is tucked up at the back? What are you meant to say if you are offered food you don&amp;rsquo;t like at a dinner party? And what ought you to wear if you&amp;rsquo;re invited to a ball? If these questions baffle you, fear not!&lt;br /&gt;
For help is at hand in the form of The Ladies&amp;rsquo; Book of Etiquette. Florence Hartley&amp;rsquo;s insightful etiquette guide was first published in 1860, and yet her witty and useful advice on behaving like a lady often still rings true down the ages. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to live in the nineteenth century to agree with Hartley that it is rude to finish someone else&amp;rsquo;s jokes. Whatever the situation, whether the reader would like to know how to be as ladylike as possible when seasick or the best colour schemes for bridesmaids&amp;rsquo; dresses, this thorough and wide-ranging book will provide sensible and succinct guidance, as well as shed light into life in the nineteenth century. Did you know that apparently you could spot a lady who had laced her corset too tightly from the lack of circulation making her nose go red?&lt;br /&gt;
Published alongside The Gentlemen&amp;rsquo;s Book of Etiquette, this is the perfect gift for that special someone in your life, or as a treat to yourself as you aspire to set step on the path towards becoming a lady! Let every action, while it is finished in strict accordance with etiquette, be, at the same time, easy, as if dictated solely by the heart. To be truly polite, remember you must be polite at all times, and under all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
