  <title>Free Your Mind and the Best Will Follow - Myrtle D. Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If it aint one thing its another was a catchy phrase I often heard growing up. At the time, I didnt give it much thought, except that I heard it a lot. But fast forward a few decades, and I get it; in life, theres always going to be something! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recently heard a pastor say as he delivered the eulogy for a young man who had battled addiction most of his life: We all have issues. And if you are sitting out there in your pew thinking that you dont have any, then maybe thats your issueyou think you dont have any. Man, was he on target. Theres always something! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its your health. Disease is robbing you of your joy. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your finances. You just lost your job and bills are piling up. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your addiction. Your life is spiraling out of control. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your weight. You know you need to do better but cant seem to get a grip. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your run-ins with the law. Youre an ex-convict, stuck in the penal systems revolving door. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your childhood. Abuse and rape have left you with wounds so deep that they have festered into a sore that just wont heal. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your relationships. Youve been beaten and battered by your spouse and you dont know where to turn. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
Its your gender identity. You are gay and you feel trapped. Free your mind!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Free Your Mind and the Best Will Follow is a guide to letting go of your issues and living your dreams. It is a book of stories, spiritual truths, and activities that will help you realize that you are so much more than your circumstances and conditions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now is the time to reconnect with your inner power. Its time to let go of your past." />
