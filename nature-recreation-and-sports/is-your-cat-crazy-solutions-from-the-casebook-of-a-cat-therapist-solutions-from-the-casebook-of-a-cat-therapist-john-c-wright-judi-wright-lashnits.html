  <title>Is Your Cat Crazy Solutions from the Casebook of a Cat Therapist: Solutions from the Casebook of a Cat Therapist - John C. Wright, Judi Wright Lashnits</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Irresistible stories of how a leading animal behaviorist diagnoses and treats cat behavior problems&lt;P&gt;Considered one of the country&#39;s leading animal behaviorists, Dr. John Wright has spent the last decade making house calls on problem pets. He diagnoses the cause of the problem behavior and then works with owners to find an appropriate treatment. This book, an engaging account of his work with misbehaving felines, is at once funny, charming, and highly informative. Readers will learn why cats refuse to use their litter boxes, scratch and bite, go through sudden personality changes, react in different ways to different people and other animals, and behave the way they do; and they&#39;ll find out what works and what doesn&#39;t work when it comes to kitty &quot;discipline&quot;. The result is a book no cat lover will want to miss." />
