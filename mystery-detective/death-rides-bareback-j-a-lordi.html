  <title>Death Rides Bareback - J. A. Lordi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jessica Lennoxs life is a shambles. Her comfortable marriage is over; her children are estranged; and her partnership in her CPA firm is hanging by a thread. Although shes only forty-six, she looks and feels oldold and finished. Jessie, a prominent accountant in a small Maryland town, needs to find a way to make lemonade from the lemon trees she seems to have grown in her lifes orchard.
Someone has financially gutted the CPA firm and framed Jessie for the crime. Worse, her home has been robbed and vandalized, and now one of her ex-partners is dead. In the midst of her troubles, Jessie reconnects with an old friend named Elise Bentley, a riding instructor and artist in northern Virginia. They enlist a handsome trust lawyer, Alden Marshall, to help track down the embezzled funds, trying to clear her name. Then, someone tries to kill her. 
Jessie retreats to Montana to assist an elegant heiress, Josie Hitchcock, who owns a ranch there; but she is still pursued by a possible killer. Now, only time will tell whether Jessie can make it safe for her children to come home." />
