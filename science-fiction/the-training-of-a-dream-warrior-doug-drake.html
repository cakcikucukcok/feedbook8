  <title>The Training of a Dream Warrior - Doug Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leo is a shy, studious, quiet ten-year-old boy who lives with his brother and mom on Lakeside Drive. His puzzling dreams are the first indication that something unusual is about to take place in his quiet and friendly neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he sees the mysterious symbol from his dreams hung on the inside of the front door of his home, he realizes that things out of his dreams have begun to appear while he is wide awake. The dark-clad strangers who captured his brother, Blaine, and took him to the smoke- and stench-filled building of his dreams are now real and chasing him and his friends through the fields and streets of his neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explosion rocks the street where they live and brings a shocking death to two kids when Leo and his friends are forced into an empty home and threatened at knifepoint by the leader of a gang of teens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leo and his best friend, Amanda, search the library for ancient texts for reasons why he has been singled out by the Nephi. The Nephi at first appears to be just a tall teenager, but in dreams, he is revealed to be something far more sinister, who is trying to draw others into the enticing darkness that has already captured the gang of teens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnificent winged creature from his dreams tells Leo he has been chosen to see these mysteries. The Nephi must be stopped, but he doesnt realize he is the one picked to defeat him. What he also has yet to discover is that the Lion-horses and giants of his dreams are real and only the beginning lessons in his spiritual journey and the training that has been started for him. &lt;/p&gt;" />
