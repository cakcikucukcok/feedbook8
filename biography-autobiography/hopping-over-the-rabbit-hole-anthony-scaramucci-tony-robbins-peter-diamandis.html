  <title>Hopping over the Rabbit Hole - Anthony Scaramucci, Tony Robbins, Peter Diamandis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Develop the Scaramucci mindset that drives entrepreneurial success&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hopping over the Rabbit Hole&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the rise, fall, and resurgence of SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, giving you a primer on how to thrive in an unpredictable business environment. The sheer number of American success stories has created a false impression that becoming an entrepreneur is a can&#39;t-miss endeavor—but nothing could be further from the truth. In the real world, an entrepreneur batting .150 goes directly to the Hall of Fame. Things happen. You make a bad hire, a bad strategic decision, or suffer the consequences of an unforeseen market crash. You can&#39;t control what happens to your business, but you can absolutely control how you react, and how you turn bumps in the road into ramps to the sky. Anthony Scaramucci has been there and done that, again and again, and has ultimately come out on top; in this book, he shares what he wishes he knew then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your chances of becoming an overnight billionaire are approximately the same as your chances of being signed to the NBA. Success is hard work, and anxiety, and tiny hiccups that can turn into disaster with a single misstep. This book shows you how to use adversity to your ultimate advantage, and build the skills you need to respond effectively to the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how to deal with unforeseen events&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Map a strategic backup plan, and then a backup-backup plan&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Train yourself to react in the most productive way&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Internalize the lessons learned by a leader in entrepreneurship&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For every 23-year-old billionaire who just created a new way to send a picture on a phone, there are countless others who have failed, and failed miserably. &lt;i&gt;Hopping over the Rabbit Hole&lt;/i&gt; gives you the skills, insight, and mindset you need to be one of the winners.&lt;/p&gt;" />
