  <title>Separation Anxiety - Laura Zigman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Separation Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a hilarious, heart-breaking and thought-provoking portrait of a difficult marriage, as fierce as it is funny.... My advice: Start reading and don&amp;#8217;t stop until you get to the last page of this wise and wonderful novel.&quot; &amp;#160;&amp;#8212;Alice Hoffman&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN ANTICIPATED BOOK FROM:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly * Cosmopolitan * USA Today * Real Simple * Parade * Buzzfeed * Glamour * PopSugar&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From bestselling author Laura Zigman, a hilarious novel about a wife and mother whose life is unraveling and the well-intentioned but increasingly disastrous steps she takes to course-correct her relationships, her career, and her belief in herself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judy never intended to start wearing the dog. But when she stumbled across her son Teddy&amp;#8217;s old baby sling during a halfhearted basement cleaning, something in her snapped. So: the dog went into the sling, Judy felt connected to another living being, and she&amp;#8217;s repeated the process every day since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life hasn&amp;#8217;t gone according to Judy&amp;#8217;s plan. Her career as a children&amp;#8217;s book author offered a glimpse of success before taking an embarrassing nose dive. Teddy, now a teenager, treats her with some combination of mortification and indifference. Her best friend is dying. And her husband, Gary, has become a pot-addled professional &amp;#8220;snackologist&amp;#8221; who she can&amp;#8217;t afford to divorce. On top of it all, she has a painfully ironic job writing articles for a self-help website&amp;#8212;a poor fit for someone seemingly incapable of helping herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wickedly funny and surprisingly tender, &lt;em&gt;Separation Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; offers a frank portrait of middle-aged limbo, examining the ebb and flow of life&amp;#8217;s most important relationships. Tapping into the insecurities and anxieties that most of us keep under wraps, and with a voice that is at once gleefully irreverent and genuinely touching, Laura Zigman has crafted a new classic for anyone taking fumbling steps toward happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
