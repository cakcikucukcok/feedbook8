  <title>A Grievance Too Great - Louise Cabral</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Demetrius and Sophocles Xenopolos are the sons of a ruthless power mongering Greek father and a beautiful cultured American mother. Sophocles learns inhumanity, greed and murderous brutality from his father. Demetrius emulates his mother with his love of beauty, creativity and productivity. The two protagonists represent the aspects that exist in the consciousness of human nature: one that is manifested by bestial avariciousness and the other representing creativity, growth and a desire for utilizing the benevolence of nature. This is the duality that resides in the human consciousness existing in the saga against a background of the turbulent 1900s in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storys riveting action springs from the arid soil of the Arizona desert where sheer will and uncompromising determination fuels the creation of a thriving orange ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this epic tome, spanning the tumultuous years from 1905 to the end of World War I, a woman is murdered, another is seduced, a child is kidnapped and south of the border another country is in the throes of a revolution. Within these pages, the reader will find the workings in the wheels of justice and a reconciliation of opposites that brings the peace that can be found in the half hidden recesses of the human heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabral, a mistress of storytelling, weaves together plot, purpose and a cast of characters that unveil conflict, intimacy, and the compassion of human nature while it reflects a rich perspective of the philosophy, psychology and spirituality designed to captivate us with passion and pathos. Bouquets to Cabral for another great read.&lt;br&gt;
Aurora Terrenus&lt;br&gt;
Author of &lt;i&gt;The Shroud of Sophia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Grievance Too Great, will sweep you into a younger America in which clearly defined characters will lead you through the riveting details of love, hate, the power of the human will and the desire to destroy that which is indestructible. An absolute must on your reading list.&lt;br&gt;
Jeannie Rejaunier&lt;br&gt;
Author of &lt;i&gt;The Beauty Trap&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Grievance Too Great is so much more than a story of revenge and regeneration. It is alive with living breathing characters that march right into your consciousness never to be forgotten. An exciting, unforgettable work.&lt;br&gt;
Jack Marlando &lt;i&gt;Television writer/director&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
