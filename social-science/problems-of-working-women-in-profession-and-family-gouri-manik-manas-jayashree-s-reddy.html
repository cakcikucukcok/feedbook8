  <title>Problems of Working Women in Profession and Family - Gouri Manik Manas, Jayashree S. Reddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The financial demands on the Indian families are becoming fiercer by day. The sky rocketing cost of living, increasing expenses on education of children,increasing cost of housing properties in India force every family in India to look for ways and means of increasing the household income. As a result, women in India who were mostly known as homemakers are forced to go for jobs and take up even careers that were considered only suitable for men such as working in night shifts in call centers or BPOs. They are left with no option but to fend for their families in all possible ways. Working women in India are faced with lot more challenges than their counterparts in the other parts of the world. In India men do not share on most of the household chores, it is women who have to cook, clean the house, do the dishes, wash clothes, get their children ready for school etc. Men just took care of few chores that are to be dealt outside the house. So the major burden of running the family is on the shoulders of women. It was alright for women to handle all the chores as long as they were homemakers. Now with their increasing need for getting some income for the family, they have to work all the more harder. They have to take up a 9 to 5 job plus handle all the household chores that they handled as a homemaker. Men&amp;#39;s role has not changed much. Here researchers (authors of the book) have provided a survey based report conducted on married women working in teaching profession. Various types of problems faced by them viz. psycho-social, professional, family related etc. are collected and discussed. Further an attempt was made to highlight the reasons behind those problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
