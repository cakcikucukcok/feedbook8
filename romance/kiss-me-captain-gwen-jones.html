      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;French billionaire Marcel Mercier &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; women. And there&amp;#39;s a string of broken hearts across two continents to prove it. But as CEO of Mercier Shipping, he&amp;#39;s got more important things to worry about &amp;#8230; like why the charter company he just purchased in the United States is suddenly the center of an international media firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that big, bad Mercier Shipping owns Captain Dani Lloyd&amp;#39;s ship, she&amp;#39;s sure her job is at stake. But she won&amp;#39;t go down without a fight&amp;#8212;even if it means chaining herself to the mast of the &lt;em&gt;Esther Reed&lt;/em&gt; and refusing to set foot on shore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delectable captain and her newsworthy dramatics are a PR nightmare, but Marcel is happy to let Dani prove her skills on a weeklong sail to Boston. He knows no woman can resist him for that long &amp;#8230; in fact, he&amp;#39;s counting on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Marcel&amp;#39;s plan to seduce Dani backfires as sparks fly between the billionaire playboy and the passionate captain. Which leaves Marcel realizing that winning her heart is a challenge he can&amp;#39;t afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
