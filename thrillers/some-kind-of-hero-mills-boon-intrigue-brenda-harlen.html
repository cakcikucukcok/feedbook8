        &lt;p&gt;He had cop written over every inch of his tempting body, and beautiful senator&#39;s daughter Riane Rutherford-Quinlan knew from the moment he asked her to dance that he wasn&#39;t the type to attend charity balls. He was there for a reason. He was searching for something - or someone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;UNTIL HE FOUND HER.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-cop turned private investigator Joel Logan had been hired to find a child illegally adopted over twenty years ago. A child, now a woman, who had no idea she&#39;d been living a lie. Could Joel tell her the truth without destroying her secure world? Or would his own desire for Riane lead to a mistake that could cost her life - and his heart?&lt;/p&gt;

Read reviews from world’s largest community for readers.

I liked these characters and cheered them on to the end. The only thing not fitting with the book was the cover because the heroine did not wear a uniform or serve in the armed forces. But that is the mistake of the publisher, not the author. Brenda Harlen always gets it right.<br /><b><i>Some Kind of Hero: Brenda Harlen: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Title: Some Kind of Hero (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Silhouette Intimate Moments Book 1246) Author(s): Brenda Harlen Publisher: Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Some Kind of Hero (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Brenda Harlen</a> </h3></p><hr/>
