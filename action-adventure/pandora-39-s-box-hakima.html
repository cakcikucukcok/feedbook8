  <title>Pandora&#39;s Box - Hakima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a November night at 1 a.m., the paths of many people were about to changesome for the better and others for the worse.
They are bold, adventurous, and different, but they were all immersed in a risky periplum.
The journey begins in a boat in Tarfaya City, where some men and women are facing the same destiny. They have escaped poverty, oppression, and injustice to carve out new lives in a new world.
You will meet Salah, an educated young man who has dreamed to pursue his higher studies; Tazia, a divorced mum who is fleeing the hardships of her town.
Many people are looking for their wheel of fortune.
What has motivated these people to go far away from their homeland? What will their new lives look like?
All answers are found in this short story, which you can bring with you while traveling and reading it for a short period of time." />
