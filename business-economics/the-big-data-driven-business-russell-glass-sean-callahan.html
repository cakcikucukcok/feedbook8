  <title>The Big Data-Driven Business - Russell Glass, Sean Callahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Get the expert perspective and practical advice on big data&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Big Data-Driven Business: How to Use Big Data to Win Customers, Beat Competitors, and Boost Profits&lt;/i&gt; makes the case that big data is for real, and more than just big hype. The book uses real-life examples—from Nate Silver to Copernicus, and Apple to Blackberry—to demonstrate how the winners of the future will use big data to seek the truth. Written by a marketing journalist and the CEO of a multi-million-dollar B2B marketing platform that reaches more than 90% of the U.S. business population, this book is a comprehensive and accessible guide on how to win customers, beat competitors, and boost the bottom line with big data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The marketplace has entered an era where the customer holds all the cards. With unprecedented choice in both the consumer world and the B2B world, it&#39;s imperative that businesses gain a greater understanding of their customers and prospects. Big data is the key to this insight, because it provides a comprehensive view of a company&#39;s customers—who they are, and who they may be tomorrow. &lt;i&gt;The Big Data-Driven Business&lt;/i&gt; is a complete guide to the future of business as seen through the lens of big data, with expert advice on real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn what big data is, and how it will transform the enterprise&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore why major corporations are betting their companies on marketing technology&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read case studies of big data winners and losers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover how to change privacy and security, and remodel marketing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better information allows for better decisions, better targeting, and better reach. Big data has become an indispensable tool for the most effective marketers in the business, and it&#39;s becoming less of a competitive advantage and more like an industry standard. Remaining relevant as the marketplace evolves requires a full understanding and application of big data, and &lt;i&gt;The Big Data-Driven Business&lt;/i&gt; provides the practical guidance businesses need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
