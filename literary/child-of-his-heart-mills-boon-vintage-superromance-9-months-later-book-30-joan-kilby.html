  <title>Child of His Heart (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (9 Months Later, Book 30) - Joan Kilby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s raised one child who might not be his own. Does he have it in his heart to do it again?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fire chief Nick Dalton has a lot on his plate. He&#39;s had to move to a small town in Washington to get his twelve-going-on-twenty-year-old daughter away from the rough crowd she was hanging out with in Los Angeles. He&#39;s also struggling with the knowledge his late wife imparted on her deathbed–their child might not be his biologically.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Erin Hanson has returned to the small town she grew up in to come to grips with a failed romance, and Nick is just the kind of man to make her quickly forget her woes. But suddenly she has a more wrenching situation on her hands–she&#39;s pregnant with her ex-fiancé&#39;s child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Erin knows Nick loves her. Now they both have to find out if he can love her baby, too.&lt;/p&gt;
