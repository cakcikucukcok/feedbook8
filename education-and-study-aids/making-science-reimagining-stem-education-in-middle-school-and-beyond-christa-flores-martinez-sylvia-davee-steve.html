Steeped in research and history, but as modern as a trip to Mars, this book will make you think deeply about the nature of science and science learning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Richly illustrated with examples of student work, this book offers project ideas, connections to the new Next Generation Science Standards, assessment strategies, and practical tips for educators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Anthropologist turned science and &amp;ldquo;making&amp;rdquo; teacher Christa Flores shares her classroom-tested lessons and resources for learning-by-making in the middle grades and beyond.

Imaginative, lyrical, and astonishing lessons come to life as Christa unfolds her Problem-based Science curriculum for the middle years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For many students, middle school is a time when science class turns boring, as wonder turns to worksheets and dull experiments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Making Science: Reimagining STEM Education in Middle School and Beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is about combining new technology from the maker movement, real world materials and a designer mindset to create personalized learning experiences that engage students in the wonder of science.
