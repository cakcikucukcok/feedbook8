  <title>Harvest of Fear - Vera Moreno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Naranjo family are longtime residents of Peach Haven. They own an Implement Store and are well-to-do. The family consists of four childrenVeronica, Lisbeth, Mike, and Jimand Uncle Paul and his wife who own the largest peach farm in Peach Haven.
Veronica is a student at the university and has been dating Neil, a handsome medical research student for six wonderful, glorious months. However, their relationship started to suffer. Neil started to show his true colors. He was a very jealous and possessive person. He started to continually abuse her. First by slapping her around, pulling her hair, then throwing her on the ground, and kicking and beating her. She loved him too much, so she made excuses for the beatings. Yet when she looked into his eyes, she saw that there was no warmth. They were eyes that only spoke of things Veronica refused to believe.
Neil was raised in the house that was used as a family home as well as a research lab. His play as well as sex experiments were with the cadavers. One day, his mother found him having sex with a lovely cadaver. She told him the facts of life. His father was another thing. He took him to the red-light district. He showed him how to have fun then murder the victim. Then one day, he met and fell in love with a beautiful and talented young lady. He loved Veronica as only a young, talented, warped man could love. He continued to abuse her: broken jaw, broken arms, bruises, tortured, and yet there was a good show in public. Until one day, he went too far and admitted that he had murdered her folks for the insurance money and their property. Angry and hurt beyond reason, she attacked him, and a long and bloody fight ensued. Neil got the small gun from the night stand and shot Veronica. She somehow got the gun away from him and shot him dead. However, the body and gun was never found. Just a bloody left arm with Neils wedding ring was found in the bed with a badly wounded Veronica.
Where is Neil?" />
