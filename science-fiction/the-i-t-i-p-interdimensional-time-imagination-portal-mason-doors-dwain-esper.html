1. You can only stay in your Imagine created world for one week and then return back to your previous world you came from or not be able to come back from your imagined world ever.
2. There is a helmet that you carry in a bag that has a video recorder attached to it. You have to have this at all times it is what brings you back.
3. You are always mortal in your world you created from your imagination. You can die. Please be careful. 
The knowledge of the I.T.I.P. was given to Joe the one writing about the problems. Joe was giving the knowledge by a flying saucer or something  while driving back on an interstate with a friend during the day. There are five test subjects that come back from their imagined world with their stories." />
