  <title>The One Question - What Would Love Do - Caroline hts Satnam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you or your loved ones experiencing chaos in your life, at work, and in matters of the heart or your health?
Are you spending a lot of time and money getting help the traditional way only to find out you still dont have peace and joy, or know your lifes purpose, or your soul mate?
Have you tried alternative solutions, handson healing, counseling, workshops, crystals, psychics, religion, spirituality, and everything else out there?
Or, are you one of the lucky ones who seems to have the perfect life yet still feel like somethings missing?
The author of this amazing and revealing book went through all of that and more!
Caroline was born with the question Why? in her mouth and drove all her teachers crazy trying to find the answers. Unable to get satisfaction and to escape what seemed like mental torture, Caroline
became totally physical by joining the Canadian military in 1967 as a Physical Education and Recreation Instructor.
Pushing herself physically suppressed her mental body for a short period of time. Although excelling in all that she did, the pull of the Why? did not die, it just became stronger. Sixteen years later Caroline left her physical, military life and completely immersed herself in an invisible, metaphysical world seeking the key that would unlock the door to all the answers." />
