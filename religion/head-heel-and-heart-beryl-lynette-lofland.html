  <title>Head, Heel and Heart - Beryl Lynette Lofland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First Corinthians 12:13 (King James Version) states, For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. This scripture assures us that we should not compare one another as human beings because the spirit cant really compete with itself. Why? Its because whoever we are and whatever assignment weve been given, we can only do it by the same Holy Spirit breathed within us, and that spirit operates with the same power in every human being. It appears to be one of those laws placed in the universe, the same as the law of gravity. The law of spirit cant be changed by the saved or unsaved, Jews or Gentiles, by people with broken spirits, or those who are confident and whole; actuated power is based on knowledge, experience, and maturity of its existence in us and will manifest itself based on a series of twist and turns, highs and lows, ebbs and flows, calamities, and consolations until we understand how it works. 
As we mature, we learn to navigate around difficult timeslike nonsupportive people and unexpected situationsas Spirit guides each of us to our true assignments. This book was written to compare the spiritual journeys of Joseph and David, two anointed men in the Bible who were granted the privilege of carrying two different mantles guided by the same Holy Spirit to demonstrate different expected ends.
In reading this book and getting a clearer more lucid understanding of how Spirit works, hopefully, it will encourage you to continue journeying while ignoring negative distractions such as people and/or circumstances until you realize Gods purpose for you and learn to relax so that Spirit can prompt and excite you towards your own specifically designed plan and outcome. (King James Version: Jeremiah 11:29) Read the narratives of Joseph and David first then analyze the Holy Spirits power at work! Youre certainly welcome to use this book for Sunday school lessons, small religious classes, or just as a teaching tool to build the faith of yourself and your children." />
