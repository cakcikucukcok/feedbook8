  <title>Apricot&#39;s Revenge - Song Ying, Howard Goldblatt, Sylvia Li-chun Lin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A business tycoon in China is found dead; he apparently suffered a heart attack while swimming.  His body is washed onto a beach in a popular resort known as the Hawaii of the East. But soon it becomes clear that he was murdered. Three immediate beneficiaries of his death become the suspects: the vice president of the company, Zhou, who is in line to take over his position; his young widow, Zhu, who stands to inherit a huge amount of wealth; and his arch business rival, Hong, who is competing in a bid over a piece of hot property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nie Feng, a young investigative reporter for a magazine, interviewed the victim just a few days before he died. Through his own research, Nie Feng discovers a new suspect who is not on the police&#39;s radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apricot&#39;s Revenge&lt;/i&gt; is an absorbing detective novel and more. Song Ying uses an ingenious plot to investigate social problems in modern China, which makes the book a profound and captivating read, leaving readers thinking long after reaching the last page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
