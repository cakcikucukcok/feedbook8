  <title>The First Reginald Bretnor MEGAPACK ®: 26 Classic Science Fiction &amp; Mystery Stories - Reginald Bretnor, Grendel Briarton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The late Reginald Bretnor (1911-1992) was never a prolific writer -- he wrote only a handful of books and about 100 short stories (and more than 120 short-short &quot;Feghoots&quot; under his Grendel Briarton pseudonym) -- over a 45-year writing career. In addition to wars, weaponry, and science fiction, Bretnor&#39;s broad interests included cats. (And puns. Did we mention the horrible puns?) These subjects are all touched on in this collection. A sly sense of humor permeates Bretnor&#39;s fiction, and as we work to digitize his complete body of work and present it to readers in a series of Reginald Bretnor Megapacks, we know you&#39;ll have fun reading it all. &lt;P&gt; Included in this volume are: &lt;P&gt; SUGAR PLUM&lt;BR&gt; GNURRS COME FROM THE VOODVORK OUT&lt;BR&gt; CAT&lt;BR&gt; MAYBE JUST A LITTLE ONE&lt;BR&gt; UNKNOWN THINGS&lt;BR&gt; BUG-GETTER&lt;BR&gt; AUNT&#39;S FLIGHT&lt;BR&gt; DR.
