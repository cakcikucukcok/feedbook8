  <title>Early Work - Andrew Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;What a debut! &lt;i&gt;Early Work&lt;/i&gt; is one of the wittiest, wisest (sometimes silliest, in the best sense), and bravest novels about wrestling with the early stages of life and love, of creative and destructive urges, I&#39;ve read in a while. The angst of the young and reasonably comfortable isn&#39;t always pretty, but Andrew Martin possesses the prose magic to make it hilarious, illuminating, moving.&quot;   --Sam Lipsyte, author of &lt;i&gt;The Ask&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Fun Parts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For young writers of a certain temperament--if they haven&#39;t had such notions beaten out of them by MFA programs and the Internet--the delusion persists that great writing must be sought in what W. B. Yeats once called the &quot;foul rag and bone shop of the heart.&quot; That&#39;s where Peter Cunningham has been looking for inspiration for his novel--that is, when he isn&#39;t teaching at the local women&#39;s prison, walking his dog, getting high, and wondering whether it&#39;s time to tie the knot with his college girlfriend, a medical student whose night shifts have become a standing rebuke to his own lack of direction. When Peter meets Leslie, a sexual adventurer taking a break from her fiancé, he gets a glimpse of what he wishes and imagines himself to be: a writer of talent and nerve. Her rag-and-bone shop may be as squalid as his own, but at least she knows her way around the shelves. Over  the course of a Virginia summer, their charged, increasingly intimate friendship opens the door to difficult questions about love and literary ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a keen irony reminiscent of Sam Lipsyte or Lorrie Moore, and a romantic streak as wide as Roberto Bolaño&#39;s, Andrew Martin&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Early Work&lt;/i&gt; marks the debut of a writer as funny and attentive as any novelist of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Beautifully executed and very funny, Early Work is a sharp-eyed, sharp-voiced debut that I didn&#39;t want to put down.&quot; --Julia Pierpont, author of &lt;i&gt;Among the Ten Thousand Things&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Little Book of Feminist Saints&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
