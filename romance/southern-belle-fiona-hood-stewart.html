  <title>Southern Belle - Fiona Hood-Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elm MacBride&lt;/em&gt; belongs to a world of wealth, politics and Southern hospitality. But when her husband, a self-absorbed politician who will stop at nothing to seize power, betrays her, Elm flees Savannah to her old friend&#39;s chalet in the heart of Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meeting a beautiful woman on the ski slopes is the last thing Irishman Johnny Graney thought would happen when he agreed to a family vacation in Gstaad. After all, no woman has been able to capture his heart since the terrible day his young wife was killed. But there&#39;s something intriguing about Elm MacBride, in whom he senses an incredible strength.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Elm finds herself equally drawn to Johnny&#39;s passion for his home, the Thoroughbred horses he raises–and for her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the ties Elm has to the world of old politics are not easily severed and she finds herself an unwilling pawn in her husband&#39;s game of power, forced to maintain appearances with a man determined to control her every move. And when his desperate actions threaten to destroy her, Johnny must save not only their love, but Elm&#39;s very life…&lt;/p&gt;
