  <title>Haberdashery - Carmella McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannah has always been a bit of a dreamer. She loves nothing more than escaping into the pages of a bodice ripper, where the men are a darn sight more impressive than her husband, Michael. It would be fair to say her 5-year marriage was not living up to her romantic expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She channels her frustrations and creativity into her sewing and crafts some beautiful pieces. It started with her own wedding dress, which had a strangely magical look after she discovered a mysterious haberdashery shop and its even more mysterious owner, the quirky Fae Dorothy Grim.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A chance encounter with a tall, dark stranger sets a chain of events in motion, which turn her life around. Still spinning, she hurtles from one big life change to another. Can Hannah make, cut, sew and put a special finish on her own life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This heart-warming tale will have you rooting for&amp;nbsp;Hannah as she stitches together her new life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
