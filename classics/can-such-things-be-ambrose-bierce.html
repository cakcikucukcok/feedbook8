  <title>Can Such Things Be? - Ambrose Bierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Can Such Things Be?&amp;quot; is a collection of short stories by Ambrose Bierce, whose first edition appeared in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
24 short stories in fairly typical Bierce fashion - ghostly, spooky, to be read (or listened to) in the dark, perhaps with a light crackling fire burning dimly in the background. Stories of ghosts, apparitions, and strange, inexplicable occurrences are prevalent in these tales, some of which occur on or near Civil War fields of battle, some in country cottages, and some within urban areas. &amp;quot;Can Such Things Be?&amp;quot; implies and relates that anything is possible, at any time.&amp;nbsp;" />
