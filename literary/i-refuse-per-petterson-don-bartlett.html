  <title>I Refuse - Per Petterson, Don Bartlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A masterful new novel from Per Petterson, who &quot;provides one of literature&#39;s greatest gifts . . . a welcome refuge from our cacophonous world&quot; (NPR)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Per Petterson&#39;s hotly anticipated new novel,&lt;i&gt; I Refuse&lt;/i&gt;, is the work of an internationally acclaimed novelist at the height of his powers. In Norway the book has been a huge bestseller, and rights have already been sold into sixteen countries. In his signature spare style, Petterson weaves a tale of two men whose accidental meeting one morning recalls their boyhood thirty-five years ago. Back then, Tommy was separated from his sisters after he stood up to their abusive father. Jim was by Tommy&#39;s side through it all. But one winter night, a chance event on a frozen lake forever changed the balance of their friendship. Now Jim fishes alone on a bridge as Tommy drives by in a new Mercedes, and it&#39;s clear their fortunes have reversed. Over the course of the day, the life of each man will be irrevocably altered. &lt;i&gt;I Refuse&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, unforgettable novel, and its publication is an event to be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;" />
