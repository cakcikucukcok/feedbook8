  <title>Journey to Gone - Theodore J. Gourley Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Journey to Gone
A TOMORROWS CHILDREN SERIES BOOK
By Theodore J. Gourley Jr. Ed.D
It begins with Pop Pop saying
 Sit down children and listen to the story of the creation of the Gone Machine and Zoom Travel that Roy and I created and our adventures along the way
Jon was the first Gone Machine traveler. He thought hed be alone in cyber space; he didnt know there were pirates there! What was that? It almost killed me!
The Journey to Gone is the story of two very different boys who become lifelong friends. When they meet, Jon is an outgoing middle school student with an interest in art, girls, sometimes sports but never school work. Roy is disabled, picked on by bullies, reserved, brilliant and an honor student. As they grow they realize that what one lacks the other has and in time their combined talents, knowledge and imagination resulting in numerous inventions and adventures. Their inventions range from Tat-Go which easily and painlessly removes old tattoos to make room for new ones,  to mind controlled cars, to a teleportation device they name Gone Machine because once youre in it and push the button all that remains of you is Gone.
 Their success attacks worldwide attention including the envy of those who want to steal their ideas. The results include robberies, sabotage, murder, and adventures across the globe and into Cyber Space, the land of the Gone Machine and Cyber Pirates. Along the way Jon and Roy become inventive, courageous adults." />
