  <title>Anxiety - Kendra Motors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where does anxiety come from? One of the studies that has been conducted, found that the amygdala in our brain play an essential role in the process of creating cortisol, the stress hormone, and that many of our reactions are somehow related to that cerebral region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, an explanation of the amygdala&amp;rsquo;s functions and processes will be given. Furthermore, anxiousness keeps us from making rational, correct decision and thus, it eliminates beneficial opportunities in our future. We need to keep this in mind and care better about our mental health. This will be clarified and discussed as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last but not least, this manual shows some signs of highly sensitive people, and expands on what to do when you can honestly label yourself as someone with such a personality. This can be extremely helpful to those who often wonder if there is something wrong with them, or who don&amp;rsquo;t recognize all the contributing factors to their hidden anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, this book can provide great support to those who struggle with anxiety, for various reasons." />
