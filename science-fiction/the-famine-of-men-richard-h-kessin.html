  <title>The Famine of Men - Richard H. Kessin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Susan Rogulski knew instantly that the cells in the petri dish had been destroyed. And the destroyer was a virus. She was sure of that. And then she thought - how stupid that the two men peering over her shoulder wore no masks gloves or gowns.... In this story, told with the voices of young scientists and physicians, the discovery of the virus is only a beginning. A reader put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t put this book down. If such a virus ever appears - and there is no reason that it couldn&#39;t, it would be discovered and studied exactly as Dr. Kessin describes.  The consequences and the cool headed way the scientists tackle an unfolding catastrophe makes a superb story. A virus that affects men that can only be studied by women scientists? Who ever imagined that? I loved the characters - even the nasty ones. And I never predicted the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story intertwines scientists, a religious community, the Congress and the military and comes out in a surprising place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
