  <title>Sweet Like Sugar - Wayne Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With eloquence and wit, Wayne Hoffman explores the unlikely camaraderie between a young Jewish man and an Orthodox rabbi, in this rich, insightful novel about love, honesty, faith, and belonging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Yiddish, there is a word for it: bashert&amp;#8212;the person you are fated to meet. Twentysomething Benji Steiner views the concept with skepticism. But the elderly rabbi who stumbles into Benji&#39;s office one day has no such doubts. Jacob Zuckerman&#39;s late wife, Sophie, was his bashert. And now that she&#39;s gone, Rabbi Zuckerman grapples with overwhelming grief and loneliness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Touched by the rabbi&#39;s plight, Benji becomes his helper&amp;#8212;driving him home after work, sitting in his living room listening to stories. Their friendship baffles everyone, especially Benji&#39;s sharp-tongued, modestly observant mother. But Benji is rediscovering something he didn&#39;t know he&#39;d lost. Yet the test of friendship, and of both men&#39;s faith, lies in the difficult truths they come to share. With each revelation, Benji learns what it means not just to be Jewish, but to be fully human&amp;#8212;imperfect, striving, and searching for the pieces of ourselves that come only through another&#39;s acceptance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A story that is beautifully told, profound and funny.&quot; --Jonathan Rosen, author of &lt;i&gt;Joy Comes In The Morning&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A stirring story about the face of love on many different levels.&quot; --Carolyn Hessel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An unforeseen tale of friendship and faith.&quot;  --Dave King, author of &lt;i&gt;The Ha-Ha&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wayne Hoffman&lt;/b&gt; is a writer and editor whose cultural reporting has appeared in the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post, Village Voice, The Forward, The Advocate,&lt;/i&gt; and elsewhere. Wayne is currently deputy editor of Nextbook Press. He lives in New York City and the Catskills." />
