  <title>Living at Nature&#39;s Pace: Farming and the American Dream - Gene Logsdon, Wendell Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For decades, Logsdon and his family have run a viable family farm. Along the way, he has become a widely influential journalist and social critic, documenting in hundreds of essays for national and regional magazines the crisis in conventional agri-business and the boundless potential for new forms of farming that reconcile tradition with ecology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Logsdon reminds us that healthy and economical agriculture must work &quot;at nature&#39;s pace,&quot; instead of trying to impose an industrial order on the natural world. Foreseeing a future with &quot;more farmers, not fewer,&quot; he looks for workable models among the Amish, among his lifelong neighbors in Ohio, and among resourceful urban gardeners and a new generation of defiantly unorthodox organic growers creating an innovative farmers-market economy in every region of the country.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nature knows how to grow plants and raise animals; it is human beings who are in danger of losing this age-old expertise, substituting chemical additives and artificial technologies for the traditional virtues of fertility, artistry, and knowledge of natural processes. This new edition of Logsdon&#39;s important collection of essays and articles (first published by Pantheon in 1993) contains six new chapters taking stock of American farm life at this turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
