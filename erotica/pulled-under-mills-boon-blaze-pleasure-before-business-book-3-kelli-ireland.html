  <title>Pulled Under (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Pleasure Before Business, Book 3) - Kelli Ireland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Bare Truth&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just weeks ago, Levi Walsh became the proud part-owner of Beaux Hommes, a bar featuring the sexiest exotic male dancers in the city – including himself. But as Levi, a financial whiz in his own right, goes over the books, he realizes something is definitely not right. And then the IRS comes knocking on his door.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IRS investigator Harper Banks is determined not to notice that Levi is hot, ripped and seriously sexy. Her job is to investigate dirty businesses, not indulge in even dirtier pleasures. But even as his skilled seduction melts her rigid self-control, Harper is certain of one thing: Levi is lying to her. Which means she&#39;ll have to strip him down…and pull him under!&lt;/p&gt;
