  <title>Dead No More - L. R. Nicolello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Don&#39;t miss this exciting mix of hot romance and Black Ops.&quot; &amp;#151;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Catherine Coulter&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&quot;Incredibly intense, beautifully written and drop dead sexy, L.R.Nicolello&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Dead No More&lt;/em&gt; is a top-notch romantic thriller. It grabs you by the throat on the first page and doesn&#39;t let go until the very last line. Nicolello&#39;s storytelling gets better and better. You won&#39;t want to miss this one.&quot;  &amp;#151;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author J.T. Ellison&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next person you trust&amp;#8230;may be the last&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Lily Andrews was once the most sought-after undercover operative at Unit 67, a Black Ops agency buried deep within the U.S. Intelligence Community. But then her partner&amp;#8212;and fianc&amp;#233;&amp;#8212;turned rogue, leaving her for dead after a mission gone horribly wrong. Disgusted with 67&#39;s attempt to cover up Jackson&#39;s traitorous actions, Lily walked away from everything she knew and loved&amp;#8230;and swore she&#39;d hunt her ex down on her own and bring him to justice.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When the handsome, undeniably alpha Derek Moretti needs her help to pursue a ruthless sociopath who is putting advanced weaponry into the hands of terrorists, Lily sees her chance to return to 67 with her pride intact. She didn&#39;t realize how much she&#39;d missed the adrenaline rush of being undercover&amp;#8212;or maybe that&#39;s the heat that races through her whenever Derek is near. But soon Lily will have to choose between the vengeance she craves and the country she&#39;s sworn to protect. And with the clock ticking down on a nuclear catastrophe, she knows that this time, if she&#39;s trusted the wrong man, she won&#39;t live to regret it&amp;#8230;" />
