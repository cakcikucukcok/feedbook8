  <title>Places That Matter - Dr. Joan Ferrante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Places that Matter &lt;/I&gt;asks the reader to identify a place that matters in their life&amp;mdash;their home, a place of worship, a park, or some other place that acts as an emotional and physical anchor connecting them to a neighborhood. Then they&amp;rsquo;re asked: in what ways do I currently support, or fail to support, that neighborhood? Should support be increased?&amp;#160; If so, in what ways?&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; To answer these questions, Joan Ferrante guides readers through a project-based learning experience that centers on the power of descriptive research to write a meaningful research brief. Through this process, students are introduced to basic principles and acquire the experiences needed to complete more complex explanatory and assessment research, all while being given the opportunity to gather data and write about something immediate and personal. Class tested in Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s own lectures and perfect for courses such as urban sociology, rural sociology, social problems, research methods, applied research, assessment, and others, the book&amp;rsquo;s overarching goal is to help readers assess their neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s needs and strengths, and then create a concrete plan to support the neighborhood to promote prosperity.&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Accompanying the book is an instructor&amp;rsquo;s companion website with a facilitator&amp;rsquo;s guide to project-based learning and rubric aligned to common learning objectives to make tracking and reporting easier.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;" />
