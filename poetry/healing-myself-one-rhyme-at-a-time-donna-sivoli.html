  <title>Healing Myself, One Rhyme At a Time - Donna Sivoli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Healing Myself, One Rhyme at a Time presents a collection of poetry by Donna Sivoli. She began writing as a small girl when she discovered that it wasn&#39;t easy to express her thoughts and feelings in her childhood home. Instead, she wrote notes and buried them in the backyard, only to dig them up later. As an adult, she began writing poetry and stories as a sort of self-therapy in an attempt to heal herself from a dysfunctional and abusive childhood.  In these verses, she writes about family and her early love for her older brother, and how that love was destroyed through betrayal and all the other emotional ups and downs of growing up in a dysfunctional family, especially the hurt and the confusion when things are not as they appear to be.   &quot;Healing Myself, One Rhyme at a Time is a memoir in poem and story ... a hero&#39;s journey that inspires us to find our way to healing and wholeness. ... It is raw, it is honest, it is love.&quot; -Shelley Morningsong,  singer/songwriter" />
