  <title>Evening&#39;s Empire - David Herter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David Herter&#39;s first novel, &lt;i&gt;Ceres Storm,&lt;/i&gt; was recently published to widespread acclaim. &quot;Distinctive and imaginative, Herter&#39;s tale moves to its own disconcerting logic: a debut of immense promise,&quot; said &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;. Now Herter moves from SF to contemporary fantasy and to a more literary mode of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Evening&#39;s Empire&lt;/i&gt; is set on the Oregon coast, in Evening, a small town famous for its cheeses. Russell Kent, an opera composer from Massachusetts, lost his beloved wife there a year ago to a freak accident, and returns now to confront his ghosts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent has been commissioned to write an opera based upon Jules Verne&#39;s &lt;i&gt;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&lt;/i&gt;, whose story fills his dreams, and only in Evening does he feel himself able to return to work. There he also discovers many strange things (even beyond the cheese sculptures), finds new love and new friendship, and is initiated into a fantastic secret the whole populace is hiding in a cavern beneath the town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways reminiscent of the Newford stories of Charles de Lint, this is an ambitious fantasy by an important new talent from the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
