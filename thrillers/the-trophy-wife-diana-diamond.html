  <title>The Trophy Wife - Diana Diamond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the readers of Olivia Goldsmith and Susan Isaacs comes a dramatic - and fun - thriller with an over-the-top ending that will leave readers gasping.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For twenty-five years Emily Childs has been the perfect wife.  She has devoted herself completely to her successful husband, Walter, on his climb to the top of the banking world, kept his home, raised his children, and entertained his clients.  Now he is about to dump her for the younger, more beautiful Angela Hilliard, the perfect trophy for his life of conspicuous achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But suddenly Emily vanishes from her home amidst clear evidence of violence.  The kidnapper - demanding an enormous ransom - is known only by his mysterious computerized voice.  Is this Walter&#39;s sick plan to get rid of his wife without the scandal that might ruin his career?  Is it his mistress&#39;s way of moving Emily aside?  Or is it one of Walter&#39;s business rivals, determined to beat him in the race to the chairman&#39;s office?  From her basement prison, Emily pleads with her husband to save her.  But as her captors panic, she realizes that she will have to save herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a thriller that spans the financial towers of the world&#39;s money centers and the underworld markets of the Caribbean, Detective Andrew Hogan races against the ransom deadline to discover the identity of Emily&#39;s kidnapper.  The ending to this novel of marriages, mistresses, and money is a shocker that serves as a warning to men who are reaching for that one final trophy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
