  <title>The Narrow Road of a Grand and Curious Opportunity - Michael McBane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Narrow Road of a Grand and Curious Opportunity is an invitation to encounter the living love of God. In truth this is a &#39;Spiritual Memoir&#39; an unfolding of the way the author has walked with Christ. Way beyond religion, this book is about the reality of daily encounter with heaven and how it changes your life. It is a story of confrontation with a love so profound that you will be undone and find your heart and mind abandoned to God as perhaps you never could have imagined.
Written in a style most have abandoned Michael&#39;s post modern words force you to engage as most books do not. This is not a shallow story of possibility it is the revelation of God to a man. It is an invite to possibility. You must digest the story has it will unearth your heart as he tells of how his was so undone, long after he met Christ in the early 70&#39;s. When you read this you will be changed." />
