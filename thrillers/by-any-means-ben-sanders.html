  <title>By Any Means - Ben Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Friday rush hour, Auckland city. A lone shooter fires across a packed street and kills a man. Detective Sergeant Sean Devereaux is assigned the case. He&#39;s not complaining - his Friday nights are seldom better spent. But the inquiry is not straightforward. Witness accounts are conflicting. The dead man appears to be an unintended victim, with the true target unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the least of Devereaux&#39;s worries, though. His current case load includes an investigation into the deaths of the wife and daughter of a wealthy finance company director. His examination has revealed the situation is far more complex than anticipated, casting real doubt upon the division of innocence and guilt. Devereaux&#39;s former colleague, John Hale, is in no position to help. Hale is occupied with his own pursuit of darkness, made all the more sinister by a dogged senior police officer determined to engineer his ruin. Together the two men hunt for the truth from those who pursue self-gain by any means.&lt;/p&gt;" />
