      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;The Digvi&#39;ja, red-faced Warlords, have determined to take control the world of Gael. They have enslaved, murdered, and destroyed whole villages. In an attempt to escape this evil, the people in Gael have left their homes, seeking a new life on another continent in Gael, Maralune. They will not go without aid, for far away, from the world of Celestra, a great and mighty force for all things good and right has seen their suffering and has come to help. This force, known as the Ancients, will open its city gates to give the fighting men and women of Gael special skills and equipment and above all, hope. Those chosen form an elite band of warriors for the Ancients, and will fight to rid the lands of Gael from the control of the Legion and to secure the well-being of future generations.

The bond grows when Kal and his brothers meet members of the other races in Gael to unite as one solid driving force against the Legion. Minzkala combines a wealth of writing perspectives. Fantasy, brotherhood in battle, faith, endearing relationships and classic gaming concepts all serve to tell the age-old tale of good versus evil.&lt;/P&gt;" />
