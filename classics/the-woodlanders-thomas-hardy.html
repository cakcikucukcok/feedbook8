Grace is the young country girl sent away by her vain and ambitious father to be educated and refined and when she returns we see how the natural order of a small rural community is irrevocably turned upside down as a result.<br /><b><i>The Woodlanders by Thomas Hardy - Goodreads</i></b> | Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) immortalized the site of his birth—Egdon Heath, in Dorset, near Dorchester—in his writing. Delicate as a child, he was taught at home by his mother before he attended grammar school.<br /><b><i>The Woodlanders (Penguin Classics): Thomas Hardy, Patricia ...</i></b> | Since his death in 1928, Hardy has been recognised as a significant poet, influencing The Movement poets in the 1950s and 1960s. Thomas Hardy's eleventh published novel, The Woodlanders, is a story of wide appeal.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Woodlanders - Thomas Hardy</a> </h3></p><hr/>
