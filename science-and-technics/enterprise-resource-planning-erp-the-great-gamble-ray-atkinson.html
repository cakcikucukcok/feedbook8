  <title>Enterprise Resource Planning (Erp) the Great Gamble - Ray Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a technical manual explaining all the nuts-and-bolts details of ERP that must be mastered to successfully implement the technology but is a guide to senior executives, managers, project managers, and project teams to understand the different aspects of an ERP project&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ERP project is far broader than the software technology and it is these other issues that can be the difference between success and failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is based on 35 years of experience of the author, who has worked in organisations all over the world in various capacities and has project-managed ERP projects with varying degrees of success and failure and has analysed many ERP projects from a recovery, mediation and litigation perspective to determine the underlying reasons for ERP failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written in laymans terms and seeks to provide senior management, middle management, project management, and their project teams with an understanding of the issues that need to be addressed and managed in order to achieve a successful outcome from an ERP project.&lt;/p&gt;" />
