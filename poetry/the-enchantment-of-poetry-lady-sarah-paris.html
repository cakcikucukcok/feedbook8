  <title>The Enchantment of Poetry - Lady Sarah Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Enchantment of Poetry marks an intriguing collaboration between an artist and a poet. Dr Georgios D. Kordis, a professor, theologian, and important artist of his time, created the fine art drawings. A renowned, world-class iconographer in the Byzantine tradition, Kordis has introduced surrealistic and impressionistic influences that create amazing images that add to Byzantine art traditions.
In this volume, the works of Kordis are accompanied by the ideologies and scenarios presented by poetess and muse Lady Sarah Paris. Her poems topics range from historical and religious subjects to romantic and mythical imagery. Lady Pariss poetry encompasses her insights, opinions, fantasies, research, and experiences to realize the depth of the connection between Kordiss art and her writings. Finding inspiration in the Master Painter, Lady Paris has written very special poems, songs, and stories referencing these wonderful fine art treasures. 
The Enchantment of Poetry brings together two art forms that benefit from the presence of the other in this enchanting illustrated collection." />
