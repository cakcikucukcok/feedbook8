  <title>Escape from Ensenada - Harris T. Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three mischievous Santa Barbara sailors embark on a journey to Ensenada, Mexico to take delivery of a sail boat. But before they can leave, Tom, who is captain of the vessel becomes involved in a traffic accident with the Prince of Pop Jeremy Princeton. Concerned for Tom&#39;s well being, Jeremy insists Tom accompany him to his Santa Ynez estate Tierra Bella to consult with his in-house physician. While Visiting there, Jeremy&#39;s art consultant Peter Harrison shows him two paintings, a Renoir and a Rembrandt, which have been stolen from the Swedish National Museum and which were shipped to Jeremy anonymously in a shipment of musical instruments. Also in Jeremy&#39;s possession is a mystical sphere called the Black Piper which is a mysterious and supernatural relic that at first is a godsend but later becomes a curse to the person who possesses it. Enter Joy Heather Kensington, an Interpol agent and Lynne Northland, an FBI paranormal psychologist who are assigned the Swedish National Museum case. The duo team up with a Swedish cop and a CIA agent to solve the mystery. The clues lead the group on an amazing and harrowing journey from Beirut to Stockholm to CAdiz to Ensenada where they uncover along the way some ancient mystical writings called the Emerald Tablets of Troth, a monk who knows how to save the world from Armageddon, a demon called Wegreog, and a malevolent smuggling scheme led by one of the most powerful persons in the U.S. government. Escape from Ensenada is a light-hearted tongue-in-cheek fictional adventure about three rogue sailors on a lark whose mischievous inclinations lead them into a labyrinth of extreme danger and mystical intrigue amidst the backdrop of today&#39;s contemporary political world scene. &lt;/p&gt;" />
