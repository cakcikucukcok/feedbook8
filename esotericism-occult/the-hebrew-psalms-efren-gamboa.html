  <title>The Hebrew Psalms - Efren Gamboa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Psalms Chapter 74
Maschil of Asaph
1Why, O EL, have you cast us off forever? Why does your angel of anger smoke against the flock of your pasture? 2 Remember your congregation which you have gotten from the days of old and which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance. Remember Mount Zion where you have dwelt. 3 Lift up your steps because of the perpetual ruins and all the evil that the enemy has done in your sanctuary. 4 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your meeting place. They have set up their own signs with the names of their gods replacing your signs that contained your name.
5 It looked like men raising axes up wards to cut thick trees. 6 They strike down with hatchet and hammers all the carved work in your house. 7 They have set you sanctuary on fire and they have profaned the dwelling place of your name to the ground. 8 They said in their hearts, Let us crush them altogether. They have burned up all the meeting places of EL in the land.
9 We see not our signs with your name O EL. There is no more prophets neither is there among us any that knows how long this will be. 10 How long, O EL, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever? 11 Why do you withdraw your hand; your Almighty right hand? Draw it out of your bosom and consume them." />
