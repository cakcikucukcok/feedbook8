  <title>Rendition - Christopher J Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young American doctor is taking a well earned holiday from her charity work in the tourist town of Portoroz in Slovenia. Feeling happy and safe in a local bar, she makes the fatal decision to talk with an attractive and charming man. But, before she realizes her mistake, he drugs her drink, takes her back to his apartment and rapes her, before giving her a fatal dose of heroin and dumping her body in the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Slovenian Police don&amp;#39;t do their job and turn a blind eye, so her Seattle-based Father hires a private detective who skilfully identifies the murderer as Marko Kovak, the son of a senior Russian criminal, with blood ties to a larger Russian gang or &lt;em&gt;vory&lt;/em&gt;. The Father wants justice so they they seek out someone who is capable of an act of rendition, someone with the skills and resources to snatch Kovak and bring him back to the States so that he can be charged with the young woman&amp;#39;s murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Walker, a former US Special Forces operative, is fresh from his exploits in Colombia when he hears the Father&amp;#39;s story and is offered a lot of money to bring Kovak back to the States. Jake doesn&amp;#39;t really need the money, but his sense of injustice is strong and he agrees to assemble a team and attempt the mission. He seeks out three close buddies, all former Special Forces soldiers and they commence training in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before they can complete their preparations, however, the private detective is snatched from the streets of Portoroz as the Russians want to find out who he is and what he knows. If the detective talks, the mission can&amp;#39;t be completed, so Jake suspends their training and his team fly immediately to Slovenia to rescue&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russians are heavily armed and fortified and they bring every man they have to the battle intent on killing the Americans and silencing any further pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing battle and car chase through Slovenia, Jake and his team need every skill they&amp;#39;ve ever learned just to get out of there alive. Can they also capture Kovak alive and bring him back too?&lt;/p&gt;" />
