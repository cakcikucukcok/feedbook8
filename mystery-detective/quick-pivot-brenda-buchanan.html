  <title>Quick Pivot - Brenda Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;1968&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cunning thief skimmed a half a million dollars from the textile mill that was the beating heart of Riverside, Maine. Sharp-eyed accountant George Desmond discovered the discrepancy, but was killed before he could report it. After stashing the body, the thief-turned-killer manipulated evidence to make it appear Desmond skipped town with the stolen money, ruining his good name forever.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Present Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veteran journalist Joe Gale is covering a story for the &lt;em&gt;Portland Daily Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; when a skeleton falls at his feet: Desmond&#39;s bones have been found in a basement crawl space at the long-shuttered mill. For Joe, digging into the past means retracing the steps his mentor Paulie Finnegan had taken years ago, when the case was still open. But the same people who bird-dogged Paulie four decades ago are watching Joe now. As he closes in on the truth, his every move is tracked&amp;#133;and the murderer proves more than willing to kill again.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;87,000 words" />
