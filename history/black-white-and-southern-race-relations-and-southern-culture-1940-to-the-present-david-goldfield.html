  <title>Black, White, and Southern: Race Relations and Southern Culture, 1940 to the Present - David Goldfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Black, White, and Southern,&quot; David R. Goldfield shows how the struggles of black southerners to lift the barriers that had historically separated them from their white counterparts not only brought about the demise of white supremacy but did so without destroying the South&#39;s unique culture. Indeed, it is Goldfield&#39;s contention that the civil rights crusade has strengthened the South&#39;s cultural heritage, making it possible for black southeners to embrace their region unfettered by fear and frustration and for whites to leave behind decades of guilt and condemnation.&lt;br&gt;In support of his analysis Goldfield presents a sweeping examination of the evolution of southern race relations over the past fifty years. He provides moving accounts of the major moments of the civil rights era, and he looks at more recent efforts by blacks to achieve economic and class parity.&lt;br&gt;This history of the crusade for black equality is in the end they story of the South itself and of the powerful forces of redemption that Goldfield attests are still working to shape the future of the region.&lt;/p&gt;" />
