  <title>The Purple Envelope - Vivien Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The outcome of a mans tragedy is that lines of communication open up and levels of interaction deepen so that improved relationships are stimulated.   The Purple Envelope is about a family with some main characters  in a way, quite ordinary.  As in anyones story, this one has some extraordinary moments.   
In the sense that everyones life is a story, this story is taken from one year of one mans life - and the lives of people around him.  
It is a story of love and how it plays its tune in this young mans life.  Is it true?  Oh yes, and as such has unbelievable moments.  The writer welcomes you, the reader, to her world.  Youll first meet her in England away from cities where its beauty can be called gentle but where life happens in ways that you will recognize wherever you may be.  Youll leave England with her as the events of the story take her to South Africa.  
Its in these two lands that this story is told.  What happens in peoples lives alongside a case of cancer?   Chemotherapy deals with the tumor, and Vivien Jones tells what else goes on.   What happens when tragedy strikes?  
Because its about people interacting with others, its a story about that which makes the world go round
Its not what happens, but the response to what happens, that makes the story.  
Ignis intra...  the fire within
Cancer, the cruel C.. and hope." />
