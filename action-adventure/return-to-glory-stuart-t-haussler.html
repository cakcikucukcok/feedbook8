  <title>Return to Glory - Stuart T. Haussler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Return To Glory&lt;/I&gt; is the third novel of a trilogy about a covert force of United States Naval Intelligence and its ongoing, at swords&#39; point, engagement with a International covert alignment of certain families, and their followers, struggling for power since the disposition of Kings, called the Illuminare`. This enemy within the Republic is now paralleled by the intention of Islam, the religious faith of Muslims, to assert itself into the lives of Americans as reflected by terrorism.  The conflicts that religion can create, based on histories scars, create a necessity for intervention to prevent an overt Jihad of the sword. Once again the threads of patriotism, romance, intrigue, murder, and deceit are woven together to produce for the reader the whole cloth of today&#39;s realities and conflicts conjured up by two forces that would attempt to destroy the Republic of The United States of America, for their own gain. The foolishness of men of these persuasions and their arrogance is depicted. The necessity to take up arms against such men is vividly and accurately portrayed for the readers&#39; enlightenment, imagination, and entertainment." />
