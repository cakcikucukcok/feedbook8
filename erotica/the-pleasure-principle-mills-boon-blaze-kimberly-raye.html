          &lt;strong&gt;What do women really want? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dallas ad exec Brady Weston thought he knew…until his wife left him, claiming he couldn&#39;t satisfy her sexually. Now he&#39;s come home to Cadillac, Texas, to learn the truth. His plan - to pick up a woman, satisfy her fifty ways till Sunday and heal his bruised ego. And he doesn&#39;t have to look far to find the girl of his erotic dreams….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What do men really want? Bar owner Eden Hallsy thought she knew…until sexy Brady Weston came back to town with a provocative proposition. Of course, she isn&#39;t surprised that Brady picked her to help him prove his sexual prowess. After all, she&#39;s been Cadillac&#39;s resident bad girl for years! Only, she never guesses that Brady will want more from her than just a good time….&lt;/p&gt;
