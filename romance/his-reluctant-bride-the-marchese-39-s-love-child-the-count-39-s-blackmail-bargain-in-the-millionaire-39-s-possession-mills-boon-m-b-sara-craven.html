  <title>His Reluctant Bride: The Marchese&#39;s Love-Child / The Count&#39;s Blackmail Bargain / In the Millionaire&#39;s Possession (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Sara Craven</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Marchese’s Love-Child&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When aristocratic Alessandro Valessi discovers the existence of his love child, he is determined to be part of Polly Fairfax&#39;s life! But Polly has been raising the child alone–and she doesn&#39;t want or need her son&#39;s father, especially after the arrogant Italian count hurt her so badly….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Alessandro leaves Polly no choice; he will fight her for custody of their child, unless Polly does as he commands…and agrees to marry him immediately!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Count’s Blackmail Bargain&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For handsome Italian count Alessio Ramontella, seducing women comes as naturally as breathing. Alessio lives his life based on two criteria: first that success and satisfaction are guaranteed, and second that all his dealings are discreet and conducted between mutually consenting parties.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then he meets innocent English beauty Laura Mason. She&#39;s sweet, tempting…and off-limits. Alessio must decide: should he ruthlessly pursue Laura until she gives in?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;In the Millionaire’s Possession&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pretty, but penniless, Helen Frayne vows to do anything to keep her ancestral home, but she doesn&#39;t realize just how far she&#39;ll have to go….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Arrogant Frenchman and millionaire property magnate Marc Delaroche wants Helen as he&#39;s never wanted a woman before. He&#39;s certain she will sell herself to keep her precious home, and he&#39;s soon proved right when she agrees to become his wife–of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it seems Marc has no intention of honoring his side of the bargain. He&#39;s demanding &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of his marital rights!&lt;/p&gt;
