  <title>The Outcasters - Maestro Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since 1995, I set out as an artist to create  
characters who were hideous, strange and did not fit 
within the normal boundaries of a modern society.
          The Circus Freaks, my 1st creations, are such 
examples of de-humanizing humans, placing 
them in a world where they are not accepted by the 
majority and must push their way uphill to gain
power.
            After 15 years of creating many people, 
places and things based on the real world, publishing 
books, including this one, I came to an epiphany.
              Who you are in relation to someone else
depends not on skin color, age, religion, sexual
preference, language, biology, country or planet.
                   These short stories contain individual
lives of those you are familiar with in one social
category or another as opposed to those of your
neighbor, family member, significant partner, your
enemies, and those unlikely youve never met.
             In the end, a world, a galaxy of prosperity
comes with the efforts of all who are related because
they are unrelated and thats exactly what this book
is about.
