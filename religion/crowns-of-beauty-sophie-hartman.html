  <title>Crowns of Beauty - Sophie Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At eighteen years old, a small-town southwest Michigan girl stepped foot onto Zambian soil and her life changed forever. As she looked into the eyes of an orphan for the very first time, she began to question why Jesus had brought her to encounter a need so pervasive. Why did Jesus open her eyes to a crisis so vast? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this young woman didnt understand then was the beauty that Jesus was also going to open her eyes to through the lives of so many hurting and broken children. After hearing the Lord speak clearly that He wanted her to move to Zambia, she courageously defied all that her family and friends hoped for her, and began her life in Zambia. All because of love for Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Hartmans journey is one of finding hope in the midst of brokenness, beauty in the midst of confusion and pain, and Jesus in the eyes of Zambian orphans. Her journey of learning the honor of carrying the stories of so many hurting and broken children is truly inspiring, and the poise and depth of her maturity is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Crowns of Beauty is an incredible and beautiful story that draws readers into such an intimate place with Jesus where His heart to bring forth beauty from ashes is evident to all. No matter who you are, Sophies stories and heart will inspire you and leave you with faith to believe that Jesus loves to crown His children in beauty, including you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
