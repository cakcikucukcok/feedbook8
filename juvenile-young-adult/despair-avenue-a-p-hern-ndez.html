  <title>Despair Avenue - A.P. Hernández</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&quot;There will always persist in my mind the sound of dead leaves crunching under my feet and that wisp of warm air that caressed my face like invisible hands. I walked a few steps and simply fell to the ground without life”.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This may well be the end of a novel, but on Despair Avenue, it is only the beginning. With his death, the protagonist is trapped in a kind of threshold, somewhere between alive and dead. His journey takes him to his old place of residence and to meet again with the one who was once his family. It will then be when she understands how much she has changed and the grave danger that lies ahead.&lt;br/&gt;" />
