  <title>Arnie - Tom Callahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this definitive biography, veteran sportswriter Tom Callahan shines a spotlight on one of the greatest golfers ever to play the game, Arnold Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner of more than ninety championships, including four Masters Tournaments, Arnold Palmer was a legend in twentieth century sports: a supremely gifted competitor beloved for his powerful hitting, his nerve on the greens, and his great rapport with fans. Perhaps above all others, Palmer was the reason golf&amp;#8217;s popularity exploded, as the King of the links helped define golf&amp;#8217;s golden age along with Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his talent on the golf course, Palmer was a brilliant entrepreneur off it, and one of the first sportsmen to create his own successful marketing brand. Forging an alliance with sports agent Mark McCormick, Palmer parlayed his popularity into lucrative deals, and helped pave the way for the multi-million-dollar contracts that have become standard for stars across all sports. But beyond his business acumen, Palmer was always a larger-than-life character, and &lt;em&gt;Arnie&lt;/em&gt; recounts a host of unforgettable anecdotes from a long life in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Callahan knew Palmer well for many years, and now pays tribute to this golfing icon. Filled with great stories from the key people in Palmer&amp;#8217;s life, &lt;em&gt;Arnie&lt;/em&gt; is an entertaining and illuminating portrait of a remarkable man and his extraordinary legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
