  <title>Love in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction - Judd Trichter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in a near-future LA, a man falls in love with a beautiful android--but when she is kidnapped and sold piecemeal on the black market, he must track down her parts to put her back together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad luck for Eliot Lazar, he fell in love with an android, a beautiful C-900 named Iris Matsuo. That&#39;s the kind of thing that can get you killed in late 21th century Los Angeles or anywhere else for that matter - anywhere except the man-made island of Avernus, far out in the Pacific, which is where Eliot and Iris are headed once they get their hands on a boat. But then one night Eliot knocks on Iris&#39;s door only to find she was kidnapped, chopped up, sold for parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to move on and unwilling to settle for a woman with a heartbeat, Eliot vows to find the parts to put Iris back together again--and to find the sonofabitch who did this to her and get his revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a determined LAPD detective on his trail and time running out in a city where machines and men battle for control, Eliot Lazar embarks on a bloody journey that will take him to the edge of a moral precipice from which he can never return, from which mankind can never return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judd Trichter&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Love in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction &lt;/i&gt;is a science fiction love story that asks the question, how far will you go to save someone you love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
