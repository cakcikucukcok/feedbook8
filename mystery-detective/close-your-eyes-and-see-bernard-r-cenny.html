      <meta name="description" content="CLOSE YOUR EYES AND SEE is the heart-pounding sequel to SPARROW&#39;S TEARS, and part two of the SPARROW&#39;S TEARS TRILOGY.  
Special Forces Captain James Ross and his girlfriend Lin Sparrow cross destinies once again with rogue CIA agent and traitor Julius Creedmoor.  Members of Abu Sayyaf have kidnapped Ross&#39;s best friend, CIA agent Randal Kloet, and are holding him for ransom in the Philippines.  Kloet will be murdered if the ransom is not paid in 96 hours.  Captain Ross rushes to Manila in an attempt to find his old friend, and finds the clairvoyant Lin Sparrow instead.  In country, Ross enlists the aid of burned-out and suicidal former JFK protective detail U.S. Secret Serviceman Peter Christianson.  Together, they form an unlikely alliance with the intriguing and mysterious taxicab driver known as Emanuel.  But Julius Creedmoor is pulling the strings, and nothing is what it seems in this treacherous world of international terrorism and betrayal." />
