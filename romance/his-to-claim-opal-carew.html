  <title>His to Claim - Opal Carew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What if you could have everything you&#39;ve always wanted, but it cost you the life you&#39;ve always known?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rafe Ranier was my boss and secret crush. A rock musician by night and head of a billion dollar empire by day, Rafe could have any woman he wanted. But I was just the shy secretary he never noticed. For years I obsessed over him, until I finally realized I had to walk away. I needed to leave my secure life behind to discover who I really was.&lt;br&gt;I never expected Rafe to follow me.&lt;br&gt;Now I&#39;m on the road with his band, Savage Kiss, and all my secret fantasies are coming true. But I fear I&#39;ve made a huge mistake, because if I get any more attached to a man I can never truly have, my heart will be broken beyond all repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Utterly hot, intense, fierce, and passionate, Opal Carew&#39;s writing is amazing. Top pick!&quot; -&lt;i&gt;The Romance Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;First published as a six-part erotic serial, His to Claim is the intoxicating tale of a woman torn between a tattooed, bad boy rock musician and the life she&#39;s always know.
