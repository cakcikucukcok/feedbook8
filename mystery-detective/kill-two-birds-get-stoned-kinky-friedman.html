  <title>Kill Two Birds &amp; Get Stoned - Kinky Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walter Snow is doomed. He stares at the blank pages in his typewriter, hoping for the spark that will finally ignite his ambition to write the Great Armenian Novel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he meets Clyde Potts. She is beautiful, intelligent, charming, perhaps psychic, and, for better or worse, very possibly unbalanced. With Potts&amp;#8217;s joie de vivre and her certified-insane partner in crime, Fox Harris, Snow is caught up in a series of pranks against corporate sprawl that they execute with a bit of booze and some wacky tobaccy from Australia known as Malabimbi Madness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things quickly spin out of control as the trio&amp;#8217;s ultimate, diuretically inspired prank leads to an unexpected, shocking conclusion, and Walter is left to wonder if the only things you ever keep in this life are the things you let slip through your fingers. &lt;/p&gt;" />
