  <title>A Layperson&#39;s Guide to Biblical Interpretation: A Means to Know the Personal God - Luke Brad Bobo, Clarence Dewitt Agan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Interpreting an ancient book like the Bible can be an intimidating task. Hopefully, this book will demystify or make less complicated the task of Biblical interpretation for the layperson (or seminarian) by the use of a handy and memorable acronym &#39;SCAR&#39;--where S means sitting with the text to listen to the Biblical author&#39;s words over and over again; where C means the literary and cultural-historical contexts; where A means analysis; and finally, where R means God&#39;s Redemptive Remedy. Readers are treated to some accessible theory behind Biblical interpretation in Part 1 and examples in Part 2, where SCAR is applied directly to two Old Testament and two New Testament texts.   God has revealed himself on the pages of Scripture. He has revealed himself because he wants to be jealously and desperately known; so, my prayer for you is that this small book along with the True Biblical Interpreter, the Holy Spirit, will greatly and patiently escort you in this endeavor so that you fall more in love with our beautiful and gracious God who knows and loves you intimately. And may your growing and maturing love for him manifest itself in your unwavering obedience to him." />
