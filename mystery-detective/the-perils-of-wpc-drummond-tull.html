  <title>The Perils of Wpc Drummond - Tull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the late 1980s and the early 1990s, WPC Harriet Drummond&#39;s previously uneventful police career gradually became more, well, interesting.   She got her wish - it seemed as if she was being singled out by fate, to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. That of cause meant that she had to be &quot;dealt with&quot; by the criminals who also occupied that time and place. After all, she had joined the police force so that she could meet a variety of people. It wasn&#39;t her fault that the people she met were, all too often, criminals who wanted to tie her up.  However, what was bad news for WPC Drummond is good news for us, if we enjoy reading about a well-endowed, smartly uniformed lady whose work keeps taking her into dangerous situations. Situations where she&#39;s always bound and gagged, often blindfolded, and sometimes spanked.   Collected here are the stories that first appeared at KP Presents, in one volume for your enjoyment.  ALL PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF THIS BOOK GO TO MACMILLAN NURSES." />
