  <title>Family-based Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Preadolescents - Laura J. Dietz, Laura Mufson, Rebecca B. Weinberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Depression is a recurrent, debilitating and sometimes fatal disorder that may first effect children between the ages of 9 and 12. Preadolescent depression is an important public health concern because it is a &quot;gateway&quot; condition that increases the risk for recurrent depression into adolescence and adulthood, particularly when there is a strong family history of mood disorders. The preadolescent period presents a window of opportunity for early psychosocial intervention for depressive disorders and for decreasing risk factors associated with recurrence, namely difficulties in relationships with family members and friends. Addressing and treating depressive disorders in preadolescents has the potential to be extremely successful given the dramatic increase in rates of depression that occur in adolescence.
&lt;em&gt;Family-Based Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Preadolescents&lt;/em&gt; is a psychosocial intervention that aims to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms among preadolescents and to provide them with skills to improve interpersonal relationships. Parents are systematically involved in all stages of the preteen&#39;s treatment to provide support and model positive communication and problem solving skills. The Initial Phase of treatment addresses psychoeducation about preadolescent depression, challenges in parenting a depressed preadolescent, and appropriate expectations for their child&#39;s behavior and performance at this time. The Middle Phase of treatment outlines ways for clinicians to present FB-IPT skills to both the preteen and parent. The Termination Phase focuses on consolidating skills, addressing prevention strategies, and identifying when to seek treatment for recurrent depression." />
