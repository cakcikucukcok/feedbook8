  <title>Love Her Like a Daughter - Kaye Bee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
His life isn’t much, but is his own. That changes when the daughter he abandoned 15 years earlier comes to stay while momma’s in jail. Lizzy’s grown into a voluptuous young woman, tempting her father in ways neither of them is prepared for. He wants to do right by his girl, but will this deadbeat dad’s wavering moral resolve fall to the seductive lure of his long-lost daughter’s sexual curiosity?
EXCERPT
If I had to guess, I figured her momma filled her head with a lot of hateful ideas about me over the years. That, along with me not making any kind of real effort to keep in touch, or being able to do much in the way of helping her as far as money goes, made it so as I couldn’t hold it against Lizzy for not wanting to be more sociable toward me.
My real problem wasn’t that. Having this hot little teenager running around my place was driving me to the living edge. I kept telling myself that this was my daughter – my own baby girl – but my dick didn’t seem to be getting the message.
When she was in her pajamas at night, with no bra on, I could sometimes see those amazing titties of hers swaying around under there. And now that I’d seen her ass in a couple different outfits, I was able to tell that even though it was small, it was definitely firm and tight. And the things the sight of her tummy in one of them half-shirt deals girls wear these days made me want to – well, it just wasn’t decent what I wanted to do.
To make matters worse, I wasn’t able to get any time alone with the TV. The only set I had was out in the front room where she was staying, and it was the only place I could watch my porn. Before she came to stay, I’d gathered up all my DVDs and stashed them in a shoe box under my bed, but I still needed some relief.
Every time I tried to jack off, I couldn’t help thinking about Lizzy. I know how sick that is, but no matter how hard I tried to fantasize about Darla, or some other chick, my daughter somehow kept getting into my head. 
I woke up one day and was just lying there thinking about nothing in particular. Then I heard the shower start up. I pictured Lizzy just on the other side of my bedroom wall getting all naked. My hand was on my stiff wood before I knew it. I pictured her soaping up those huge cans and rubbing herself all over. I blew my load in about eight seconds. I was a regular jerk off rodeo star that morning.
