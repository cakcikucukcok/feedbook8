  <title>Torben&#39;s Fountain - Sebastian Rizzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Torben Friedrich’s efforts to fight a redevelopment plan in his town and save his farm are thwarted when the mayor digs up evidence that Torben might be a Nazi murderer who has been hiding out in the United States since the end of World War Two. Torben had always known that one day he’d have to answer for his crime. He hopes his granddaughter will understand and forgive him for what he had to do to survive. As he tells her his story he reveals that in 1941, as a young cocky, independent, chauvinistic American Spitfire pilot, he was shot down in German occupied France. Injured and helpless, his only chance of survival was a brave young French girl who hid him from German search parties. To get back to England, he must first learn to pass for French—no simple feat when you’re a six-foot-one American and the trousers given you are for a five-foot-six Frenchman. And he must trust his life to a series of daring, resourceful young girls to conduct him hundreds of miles through German checkpoints, Gestapo traps, and over the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains into Spain. Was the murder he committed a crime or a necessity of war? Includes Readers Guide." />
