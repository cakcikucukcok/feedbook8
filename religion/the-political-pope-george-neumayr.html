  <title>The Political Pope - George Neumayr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;The untold story of the left&#39;s efforts to politicize the Vatican and the battle to stop it-before the Catholic Church as we know it is destroyed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Geneva} &lt;/style&gt; Pope Francis is the most liberal pope in the history of the Catholic Church. He is not only championing the causes of the global Left, but also undermining centuries-old Catholic teaching and practice. In the words of the late radical Tom Hayden, his election was &quot;more miraculous, if you will, than the rise of Barack Obama in 2008.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But to Catholics in the pews, his pontificate is a source of alienation. It is a pontificate, at times, beyond parody: Francis is the first pope to approve of adultery, flirt with proposals to bless gay marriages and cohabitation, tell atheists not to convert, tell Catholics to not breed &quot;like rabbits,&quot; praise the Koran, support a secularized Europe, and celebrate Martin Luther. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At a time of widespread moral relativism, Pope Francis is not defending the Church&#39;s teachings but diluting them. At a time of Christian persecution, he is not strengthening Catholic identity but weakening it. Where other popes sought to save souls, he prefers to &quot;save the planet&quot; and play politics, from habitual capitalism-bashing to his support for open borders and pacifism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In THE POLITICAL POPE, George Neumayr gives readers what the media won&#39;t: a bracing look at the liberal revolution that Pope Francis is advancing in the Church. To the radical academic Cornel West, &quot;Pope Francis is a gift from heaven.&quot; To many conservative Catholics, he is the worst pope in centuries." />
