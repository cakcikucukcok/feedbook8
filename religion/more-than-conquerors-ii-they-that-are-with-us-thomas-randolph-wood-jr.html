  <title>More Than Conquerors Ii: They That Are with Us - Thomas Randolph Wood Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Difficult situations occur every day, all over the world. They can occur in our homes, on our jobs, and even in our churches. As Christians, we must face these challenges and understand their roots in the spiritual world. We must also answer the call to witness Christ to everyone, especially those who cause us difficulty and distress. In &lt;i&gt;More than Conquerors II: They That Are with Us: A Believers Guide to Overcoming Opposition and Ethical Dilemmas,&lt;/i&gt; minister and author Thomas Randolph Wood Jr. shows through real-world examples how true victory over situations, circumstances, and difficult persons is available through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The helpful, encouraging lessons of &lt;i&gt;They That Are with Us&lt;/i&gt; offer answers to the hard and sometimes overwhelming challenges we encounter in our lives today. Perhaps we struggle with money, with relationships, with the future, or with faith; by sharing our stories and sharing the word of God, we can learn to honestly support each other in our walks both inside and outside the physical structures of our church buildings. Through this testimony and witness, we experience the true will of God for our congregations, for ourselves, and for our world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
