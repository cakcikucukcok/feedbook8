  <title>The China Ultimatum - Raymond Barnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;CHINA STUNS THE WORLD by imposing a deadline on Taiwan to join the motherland or face a deadly rain of missiles. America will intervene with nuclear weapons if its mediator cannot craft a resolution agreeable to both sidesin nine days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. mediator Philip Dawson finds himself the target of an assassin skilled in biological poisons, and fiercely attracted to Meiling Bei, the tough newswoman assigned to the talks. Meiling is also under attack, from a powerful clan whose ancient livelihood is threatened by her investigations. As they struggle with assassination attempts and their growing desire for each other, Philip and Meiling realize that the threats to them are somehow connected, and that nuclear war as well as their own lives will be decided by their solving the puzzles that threaten to overwhelm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, their fates as well as Taiwans depend on solving the riddle of a Chinese shipping tycoon with a terrible secret in his past, as well as a silk-shrouded Chinese Goddess worshipped in coastal temples for a thousand years. It is the ninth and last day, and the missiles will be launched soon&lt;/p&gt;" />
