      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the moment Cordelia Conner is born in New York in 1890, her seamstress mother vows her daughters life will be far better than hers. As she kisses her tiny newborns head, she dreams that one day, her daughter will become a lady of quality and marry a wealthy manand she is prepared to dedicate her life to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of miles away, young Kevin Newkirk is growing up in an influential Boston family. Kevin is accustomed to a life of prestige. But he is also very aware that he is the last male in the line and in need of a suitable wife to provide him with a son. In love with a woman whose heritage is questionable, Kevin has no idea that Cordelia even exists. But when fate brings Kevin and Cordelia together during a weekend at a summer home, Kevin decides she is the answer to his dilemma. Cordelia sees Kevin as the means to fulfill her mothers burning passion. Their relationship seems destined to be a match made in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the young couple marries and establishes their new life, only time will tell if the union between an unlikely pair will survive and create the dynasty their parents dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;" />
