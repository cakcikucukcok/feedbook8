  <title>Prey to the Lord - Frank Catanzano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The honorable organization Empowering Children is committed to mentoring kids from broken homes. At least, thats ostensibly their pupose. In reality, EC is a clandestine organization comprised of men who trade child pornography and molest children. Now, theyre being hunted by a religious fanatic who is murdering them one by one in increasingly violent ways.
Detective John Bello and his partner, Barry Schmidt, lead a skilled team in charge of identifying and stopping this zealous serial killer, despite their moral qualms over protecting the monsters of the ECwhose membes include priests, judges, and powerful businessmen. The killer has somehow obtained the secret EC membership list and uses it to his advantage.
The murderer is a master of disguise who believes he has been ordered by God to remove these perverts from society. Cunning and ruthless, he eliminates the organizations members while harboring a dark secret that drives his actions, in the name of the Lord. Due to a head wound sustained in Vietnam, Bello developed a special ability that enables him to see events from a different point of view. It is this skill that will lead him to his killer, but can he do so before the dangerous psychopath achieves his apparently divine goal?" />
