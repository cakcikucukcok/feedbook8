  <title>Key Nuclear Reaction Experiments: Discoveries and Consequences - Hans Paetz gen. Schieck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book the author charts the developments in nuclear physics since its inception around a century ago over by reviewing the key experiments that helped drive and shape our understanding of the field. It is fascinating to look at theoretical developments in the field of subatomic physics in step with the grand new ideas of the early 20th century where quantum theory and the theory of relativity opened up entirely new views of the world. Experimental progress gave hints as to ?new physics? e.g. the stepwise deciphering of the structure and composition of nuclei led to the idea of two new interactions, the weak and the strong force, and also experiments had to decide between alternative theoretical interpretations e.g. are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana particles?, do neutrinos have mass or not?, or are electrons, neutrinos, muons, or protons point particles or extended objects? In this respect it is enlightening to study the details of early experiments, where quite often epoch-making results were obtained with very simple means, but all those experiments were based on earlier attempts that were carefully refined to yield unambiguous evidence.   Here the crucial experiments that often, but not always have been the first in a subfield, are described in some detail often including original drawings or setups. Theoretical background is given, but kept compact to enable readers to chart the story of nuclear physics and the events that shaped our present understanding" />
