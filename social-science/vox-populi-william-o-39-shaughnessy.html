  <title>Vox Populi - William O&#39;Shaughnessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vox Populi is the long-awaited fourth collection of interviews, editorials, essays, observations and keen insight from legendary New York broadcaster William O’Shaughnessy. With this inspiring new anthology, Bill is back in a big way, offering compelling dialogue and opinion on timely issues and current events in politics, media, the arts and popular culture.
A masterful interviewer, O’Shaughnessy goes one-on- one with Barbara Taylor Bradford, Steve Forbes,
Joe Califano and a colorful band of townie characters from Westchester – the Golden Apple. Broadcasting
for five decades from what the Wall Street Journal hailed as “the quintessential community station in
America,” his thoughtful and muscular commentaries have been widely praised in all the important journals
in the land.
A self-styled First Amendment “voluptuary,” O’Shaughnessy is a stellar defender of Free Speech,
having devoted the good part of fifty years to fighting censorship and government intrusion from his influential
perch in the heart of the Eastern Establishment.
He’s the one they roll out when the likes of Howard Stern, Bob Grant and Imus get in a jam. Colorful national figures and beguiling “townies” abound in Vox Populi which is also laden with exquisitely beautiful eulogies and tributes to his departed friends Tim Russert, Wellington Mara, Robert Merrill and Ossie Davis.
And, as in every Bill O’Shaughnessy book, there is stunning and powerful wisdom and brilliant observations
from Governor Mario Cuomo whom he so admires.
The great American historian David McCullough observed: “I always look forward to reading the history
of our times Bill O’Shaughnessy has written.” 
O’Shaughnessy is an authentic American voice." />
