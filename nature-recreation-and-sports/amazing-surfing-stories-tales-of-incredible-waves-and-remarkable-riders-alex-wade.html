There are fascinating encounters with surfing&amp;rsquo;s true characters, men like Dave Rastovich and big wave world record holder Garrett McNamara; appearances by deadly sharks; stories of big wave surfing by night; and an account of how Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s famous disappearance for 11 days in December 1926 might just have been because she was on a surf trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel from giants like California&amp;rsquo;s Maverick&amp;rsquo;s and Maui&amp;rsquo;s Jaws to tales of Dungeons, dolphins and the derring-do of a man like Colonel &amp;lsquo;Mad Jack&amp;rsquo; Churchill. Turn the pages to flick between the left and rights of Britain, Europe, USA, Australia and many strange places in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each compelling tale has been chosen to stoke the fire of armchair surfers and hardcore wave-riders alike, and some are illustrated with colour photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
