  <title>The Myth - Jessica R. Koster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Things arent quite what they seem. One day you are sharing a mocha with your friends at the local cafe and the next youre running for your life. Not knowing who or what is chasing you. Just knowing that if they find you, youll wish you were dead. The things they would do, the torture they would put you threw and in the end if you where good enough, they would keep you as their pet, their puppet. Use you for their petty work. But if you werent good enough they would throw you out. Or at least let you think that you were free. You would get five maybe ten minutes head start if you were lucky before they released their pets on you. Using you in turn for training of the Better Stock. Survival, there is none. Because once you are captured there is no turning back. 
That is the life Augustas parents had known, the life that her mother is trying to keep her safe from. Little does Augusta know that her life will soon never be the same." />
