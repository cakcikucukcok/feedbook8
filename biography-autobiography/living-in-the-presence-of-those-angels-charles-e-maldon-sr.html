      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;ldquo;Living in the Presence of Those Angels&amp;rdquo; Mr. Maldon reflects upon that season of his life when he was without God&amp;rsquo;s peace and lived unsure of his place in life. He presents the contributions of some extraordinary people who impacted him greatly.&amp;nbsp; Addressing the uniqueness of each angelic personality, he shares with his audience how they blessed his life with spiritual encouragement and strength to persevere through many challenges and obstacles. Each person blessed him with special unforgettable memories. They contributed in a remarkable way, during that period in his life when he lived with much self-doubt and lack of confidence. Had they not been a part of his life&amp;rsquo;s journey in the Deep South, certainly his life would have turned out differently. Each of those special people left a deep impression on his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
