  <title>Songs Of Bliss - Unknown, Clive Gilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just how far will a father go to protect his daughter, especially when his &amp;#39;protection&amp;#39; is so fundamentally flawed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Billy Whitlow, one time &amp;quot;Don of Doo Wop&amp;quot;, has survived his days of drink, drugs and groupies, settling now into a more peaceful life centred on his blossoming seventeen year old daughter Bex. Revising for her &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; Levels, Bex visits Billy one Easter but the longed-for simplicity of father-daughter happiness is shattered one night in a local nightclub.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Billy&amp;#39;s world becomes one of questions; Why is his daughter in a drug induced coma? Who put her in that state? How in the name of Hell is he going to make them pay?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clive&amp;#39;s stories are linked by recurring themes of urban and future decay &amp;ndash; splintered glass, dust motes and cracked plaster; the loss of loved ones, of the ability to remember; black and white movies of the mind; shafts of golden light shattered by war; haunted memories and the night darks. There is a poetic lilt to the narrative, that delights in the minutiae of observation, bringing the mundane into the spotlight, giving it a meaning and beauty that is mostly lost on us busy ones; there is the terror of the ordinary, the shadow in the midday sun; and then there is the humour: sharp, cynical, painfully astute. Clive Gilson&amp;#39;s stories reverberate in the mind, long after they&amp;#39;ve been read. They connect us in their telling, because we relate to these deep, dark moments of human emotion that make us who we are.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I have edited Clive Gilson&amp;rsquo;s books for over a decade now &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s prolific and can turn his hand to many genres: poetry, short fiction, contemporary novels, folklore and science fiction &amp;ndash; and the common theme is that none of them ever fails to take my breath away. There&amp;rsquo;s something in each story that is either memorably poignant, hauntingly unnerving or sidesplittingly funny.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
