  <title>Sweet Pea - Karen Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you have the eyes and heart to see, youve seen the suffering before. Karen Scott, an animal lover, shares her experiences with Sweet Pea, a homeless, feral mother dog in her neighborhood who caught her eye and captured her heart. The quest to gain this wounded souls trust proved to be one of the best learning experiences of Karens life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet Peas full past and story will never be known, but thanks to Karens efforts, her future will be a much happier tale. The odds of a feral animal and a human building a relationship are frighteningly small, and success in such an effort is extremely rare, but when Karen saw an emaciated, terrified mother dog foraging for food, she knew she had to at least try. The clever survivor had successfully eluded animal control for months and had earned her deep fear of humans. In her homeless years, Sweet Pea endured and survived many injuries, including a dislocated shoulder and several broken bones. She lived in excruciating pain and fear for years, and gave birth to at least two litters. Karen watched helplessly as neighborhood boys tortured the terrified dog, and vowed to change this innocent creatures life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fateful day when Karen saw Sweet Pea, her teats heavy with milk, she knew that somewhere, her puppies depended on this pathetic and abused animal. Little did she know that both of their lives were about to change forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
