  <title>Grizzlies On My Mind - Michael W. Leach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is it about Yellowstone National Park that draws millions of visitors from all over the world? If you&#39;ve visited Yellowstone, you should already know the answer. If you&#39;ve never visited—or you have, but still don&#39;t know the answer—Michael Leach explains it to you in his book of essays, &quot;Grizzlies on My Mind.&quot;  Leach is a Yellowstone insider with unmatched passion for this nation&#39;s first national park. At the age of twenty-two, Leach&#39;s dream of becoming a Yellowstone ranger came true. It wasn&#39;t long before he&#39;d earned the nickname &quot;Rev&quot; for his powerful Yellowstone &quot;sermons.&quot; 
In &quot;Grizzlies on My Mind,&quot; Leach shares his love for Yellowstone—its landscapes and wildlife, especially its iconic bison and grizzlies—as he tells tales that will delight anyone interested in the national park system, wildlife and wild landscapes, rivers and adventure. Heartwarming and heartbreaking stories of human lives lost, efforts to save a black bear cub, a famous wolf who helped Leach through some dark personal days, the unique and oftentimes humorous Yellowstone &quot;culture,&quot; backpacking trips that nearly ended in disaster, and Leach&#39;s spiritual journey with his Assiniboine-Gros Ventre &quot;brother&quot; fill the pages—and the reader&#39;s heart. 
If you&#39;ve never been charged by an elk, traveled solo at dawn across Yellowstone&#39;s frigid interior (working your way slowly through a herd of peaceful bison in the process), or lain awake in a backcountry tent, listening for the spine-tingling breaths of a curious grizzly—but you crave such experiences, &quot;Grizzlies on My Mind&quot; is the book for you." />
