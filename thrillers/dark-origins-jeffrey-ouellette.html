  <title>Dark Origins - Jeffrey Ouellette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old twins Sadie and Mason Peabody deal regularly with the usual teenage drama: school, friends, and parents. But bright and intuitive as they are, neither could have guessed just what destiny has in store for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centuries before, an intricate plan was laid by the Originals, a group of witches and warlocks who struggled to maintain the balance between light and dark magic. Their efforts set into motion an eternal battle that threatens to entomb the world in a maze of power, ambition, and fear. These powerful magic users knew that they needed some insurance against oblivion, so they devised a way to secretly transfer their magic through their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadie and Mason are suddenly forced into the family business, a world of magic they cant hope to understand, let alone control. The twins must now find a way to navigate their strange new existence. As the old world collides with the new, the bizarre becomes their new normal. As a force more powerful than even the Originals is unleashed, the newest witch and warlock in the family will have to dig deep to survive, let alone save the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
