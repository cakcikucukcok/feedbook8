  <title>Pudd&#39;nhead Wilson - Mark Twain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First serialized in “The Century Magazine” between 1893 and 1894, Mark Twain’s “Pudd’nhead Wilson” is a murder mystery set before the American Civil War in Missouri, more specifically, in a town on the banks of the Mississippi River. During infancy, a light-skinned black baby and a white-skinned baby were switched at birth by a slave mother. Because the black baby grows up thinking he is white, he is highly racist toward his slaves. The white baby, who thinks he is a slave, grows up with no guidance and makes a living stealing, drinking, and doing other immoral things. During a murder trial, the town lawyer Puddn’head Wilson, who is seen as a peculiar fellow by the townsfolk, is able to expose the boys’ true identities. “Puddn’head Wilson” is a story carried by themes of racism, Southern customs, and questions of identity. On the surface it is a witty and satirical tale but as one digs deeper a biting social commentary of racial inequality can be found. This edition includes a biographical afterword." />

Its central intrigue revolves around two boys—one, born into slavery, with 1/32 black ancestry; the other, white, born to be the master of the house. The two boys, who look similar, are switched at infancy. Each grows into the other's social role.<br /><b><i>Pudd'nhead Wilson - Wikipedia</i></b> | Pudd'nhead Wilson was a good book, very well written, although not the best of Mark Twain. When I read the summary of it - before opening the book - I thought that it would mostly be about the slave women Roxy, and her switching her baby with her master's baby, but Twain also followed some other characters in the story like Pudd'nhead Wilson and the twins, Luigi and Angelo.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Pudd'nhead Wilson (9781515424246): Twain, Mark ...</i></b> | Classics Illustrated -093- Pudd'nhead Wilson Item Preview remove-circle ...
