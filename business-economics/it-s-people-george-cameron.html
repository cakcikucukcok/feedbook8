  <title>It’S People - George Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All organizations consist of people. The more seamlessly they work together, the more efficient and effective they will become, thereby producing a more productive organization. 
I have tried to put together an eclectic collection of thoughts and practices that will enable aspiring executives, middle management, and the CEO to move toward a more positive understanding of how they can improve the inter personal skills needed to make an organization run more effectively
These suggestions may seem somewhat random, but each attempts to contribute to building an organization based on trust and consideration of the needs of the individual that allows effort to be focused on productive effort rather than concern over how misbehavior may adversely affect each individual
What I am trying to achieve with this book is an acceptance by managers and leaders that a failure to recognize and deal with people as individuals and deal with their idiosyncratic ways will result in sub-optimal performance of your organization.
Have courage. People admire honest effort and integrity
I hope that reading this book will encourage everyone to be more adventurous in dealing with others, to be more sensitive to the individual and above all, to enjoy and have some fun in whatever you undertake.
This book also tries to highlight that there is very little which new knowledge is. I have included ideas of a number philosophers and writers over the centuries.
In fact I would argue that too many management books focus on esoteric theories of behaviour without ever really understanding how real people react. 
There is no magic!
Many of these ideas and suggestions may seem eccentric, difficult to undertake, or even embarrassing. Relax and go with the flow. In seeking to put many of these interpersonal skills into action, an excessive amount of dignity is a barrier!" />
