  <title>Exploring the Mindful Way - Tom Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immortal Self-Centric Mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important understanding seekers of spiritual maturity must come to is the difference between lucidity and hyperlucidity. Lucidity is the degree to which we are able to clearly sense information from our mostly unconscious mind. Hyperlucidity is a term used in the Implicit Cosmology for a complex of behaviors motivated by the belief we are lucid when we are actually only sensing what we have been taught to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second most important understanding is that lucidity is the seeker&amp;rsquo;s objective, but that it is achieved in small steps. The only real conscious influence we have on our mostly unconscious mind is the expression of intention. This means that we must learn to consciously examine what we think is true. Mind changes only slowly, and so, the seeker&amp;rsquo;s objective is to habitually express the intention to align perception with the actual nature of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first book,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your Immortal Self,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;the process of consciously seeking greater lucidity is referred to as the Mindful Way. Many people practice mindfulness simply to improve personal wellbeing. A few step onto the Mindful Way to seek greater understanding of their immortal nature and the nature of the reality they inhabit. Even fewer remain as wayshowers for those who seek greater lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact of our immortality is explained in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Your Immortal Self&lt;/em&gt;. This book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Exploring the Mindful Way,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;includes twenty-one essays explaining some of the more important concepts encountered on the Mindful Way.
