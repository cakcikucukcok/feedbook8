  <title>Relative Heat: Daddies and Daughters No.3 - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are 8 more short stories for your enjoyment. All involve willing daughters and their horny fathers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I bit my lip when he reached for her, from the comfort of his recliner, but she spun out of his reach, then shook a finger at him, giggling all the while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She waited for him to settle before taking a step closer, but that step quickly turned into a dance, a dance a daughter ought not perform for her father. Her hips, though, were moving, drawing his attention, as well as mine. But where I had a view of her rounded little bottom, he had a view of her bare belly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She turned, when his gaze drifted lower, causing my breath to catch. The thin cotton had crept up, splitting her vulva in the most obscene way. That she wasn&amp;rsquo;t wearing underwear was obvious. Equally as obvious was the fact that she was no longer teasing him. Indeed, she was enticing him, and I know him well enough to know that, without my intervention, she would soon find out what happens when a woman pushes a man too far, when he can no longer control his urges. I leaned against the jamb, content to watch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head, the first time he twirled his finger in the air, but her eyes were full of excitement, and she acquiesced when he repeated the gesture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Pretty shorts,&amp;rdquo; he purred, his gaze on her plump vulva.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Daddy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come closer, princess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head, even as she reached out a foot. She drew her toes over the top of his foot, and this time, when he reached out for her, slowly, she remained still, in effect, surrendering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled her onto his lap and she curled up to him, her legs hanging over the chair arm, her cheek on his chest. &amp;ldquo;Tickles,&amp;rdquo; she murmured, when he began to draw random designs on her stomach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Want me to stop?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head, her eyes closing. His gaze followed his fingertip as it continued to roam over her skin, and I watched a smile form on her pretty face, as he drew a heart around her belly button. &amp;ldquo;I love you too, Daddy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Soft,&amp;rdquo; he purred, tracing a line across her belly, down low, just above the waistband of her shorts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She moved her cheek against him, her smile fading as his fingertip moved lower, then lower still. This, the moment he made contact with her shorts, was when I was supposed to intervene. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t, though. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to destroy the moment, for, she was exactly where she wanted to be; in the safety of her daddy&amp;rsquo;s arms." />
