Printed on an uncoated stock that simulates the look and feel of a sketchbook, this delightful volume is filled with her beautiful, endearing drawings of a range of breeds. The illustrations are accompanied by notes in Dawson&amp;#8217;s own handwriting as well as a short anecdotal text that provides amusing insight into the personalities of her canine models and the experience of drawing each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stunning reproduction of this classic work filled with full-color and black-and-white complete drawings and sketches, &lt;em&gt;Dogs Rough and Smooth&lt;/em&gt; features a foreword by acclaimed writer Susan Orlean, and is packaged in a three-piece case with a beautiful cloth spine and long ribbon bookmark. &lt;em&gt;Dogs Rough and Smooth&lt;/em&gt; is sure to be a collector&#39;s item treasured by dog lovers of all ages and art connoisseurs for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
