  <title>Loving Parent - Sirée</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where are you on your life path?
Have you just learned that you will become a parent? Do you have a grown-up child whom you paid little loving attention to and now feel disconnected or even guilty? Are you a grandparent, wondering how to behave differently, better, more caring than with your own children? 
Maybe there is a feeling of lack of love or support from your childhood? Maybe you have hidden scars deep in yourself that prevent you from feeling loved and fully appreciated, as a child or as a parent?
Where would you like to be?
If you want to be more present, more loving, fully alive, then you simply need to clean what is disturbing you now. It is easy. It just takes a sincere wish, open mind, some words spoken out loud, plenty of cleansing tears, and you are with love, free.
Follow the simple energy exercises in the book; they will lead you to becoming a loving parent." />
