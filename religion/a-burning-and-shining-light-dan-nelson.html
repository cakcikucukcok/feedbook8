  <title>A Burning and Shining Light - Dan Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Burning and Shining Light&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a comprehensive, modern-day biography of George Whitefield, the Great Awakening Evangelist. Chronological in nature, its emphasis is on his travel, preaching, and influence on two continents. Nelson&amp;#39;s intent is to expand the reader&amp;rsquo;s understanding of Whitefield&amp;rsquo;s ministry to its influence today, by bringing the reader into Whitefield&amp;rsquo;s era. The reader will observe the events of his life, participating in Whitefield&amp;#39;s passion for ministry, as well as his joys and sorrows. An evaluation of Whitefield&amp;rsquo;s influence is given in the last two chapters. The book is laden with references from other biographies and books about Whitefield. The biography regards the time in which he lived, comparing it to today&amp;#39;s time, by evaluating his inward motivations and influences that made him one of the greatest preachers in the History of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers who are interested in early history of the American colonies and the history of one of the greatest dramatic preachers of all time will appreciate this look into what made evangelism what it is today. It&amp;#39;s appeal to pastors, students, and leaders who need a magnificent model of perseverance and overcoming obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students of evangelism will be intrigued by the origin of effective mass evangelism methods. Theologians and believers interested in the struggle between Calvinism and Arminianism will profit from the history of this doctrinal controversy with Wesley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The passive observer who knows nothing about Whitefield can be enlightened to an almost unbelievable legacy of Whitefield&amp;rsquo;s impact on people in a day with so many limitations on travel, communication, and expansion. The impact is a legacy of one who rose out from small beginnings to leave a tremendous example for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
