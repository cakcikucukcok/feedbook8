&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how many days it really took for the Creator of all to form the Earth and the universe, and did this divine being have assistants? If so, who were they? For what reason were we created, and where do we go from here? What about the Invisible worldsyou can read about the hereafterwhere loved ones reside and how you are building your home on the other side while residing in the physical. Learn many profound truths, those &quot;aha moments!&quot; There are plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a different insight into the biblical creation. The Bible has been and is a help and guide to many. Rumi, a thirteenth-century Persian poet, says it best on what the authors have written, &quot;Love is the religion and the Universe is the book.&quot; Love for all humanity through forgiveness along with universal laws, universal truths, and how the stars correlate to our very being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
