  <title>Deceived - Pat Hale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The noble people was the name given the Aryans who lived south of the Medes and east of Elam. The Greeks called them PERSIANS. To lie, cheat or steal was forbidden among them. More than 2,500 YEARS AGO their great king prayed that his country be protected from war, famine and THE LIE. Wars and famine came and went, still the Persian place in history was maintained. Only THROUGH LIES is that HISTORY BEING IGNORED AND DESTROYED by the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persian Horses, Arabian Gulf (?), the TALES of the Persian Nights; all points of Persian Pride are in danger. Since lying for the sake of Islam has been justified, even praised as clever, the Islamic Republic of Iran is being maintained by LIES. They want all things Persian to go away forever and be replaced by Arabian radicalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECEIVED&lt;/b&gt; is a story of change and regression, honor and deceit. It is the tale of a modern-day noble Persian who lived in Iran from the early 1900s until the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and the American patriot who befriended him. One was reared to be a sheik, ride horses, and lead caravans across the desert. The other was born in Tenessee, served in the Korean War and eliminated threats to American interests; without question. Fate intervened to change both their lives forever and lead to the beginning of the end for Persia. Although it is historical FICTION, some of the events were actual happenings told to the author by those who were there. Pat Hale has a Masters degree in Divinity from Vanderbilt University in Nashville and is, currently, working on a History Masters at American Public University online. Pat resides in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;" />
