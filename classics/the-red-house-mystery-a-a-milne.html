  <title>The Red House Mystery - A. A. Milne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Red House Mystery is a &amp;quot;locked room&amp;quot; whodunnit by A. A. Milne. It was Milne&amp;#39;s only mystery novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The setting is an English country house, where Mark Ablett has been entertaining a house party consisting of a widow and her marriageable daughter, a retired major, a wilful actress, and Bill Beverley, a young man about town. Mark&amp;#39;s long-lost brother Robert, the black sheep of the family, arrives from Australia and shortly thereafter is found dead, shot through the head. Mark Ablett has disappeared, so Tony Gillingham, a stranger who has just arrived to call on his friend Bill, decides to investigate. Gillingham plays Sherlock Holmes to his younger counterpart&amp;#39;s Doctor Watson; they progress almost playfully through the novel while the clues mount up and the theories abound.&lt;br /&gt;
