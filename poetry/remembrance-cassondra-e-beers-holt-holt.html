  <title>Remembrance - Cassondra E. Beers, Holt Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before all of time and space were created, there was Yahweh God, and there was you. He spoke you into being, framed you with His Word, and filled you with Himself &amp;ndash; writing an entire Covenanted Promise together with you. This Promise is bigger than anything you&amp;rsquo;ve yet known, for Yahweh is infinite, and He has shown you what you are ready for in such a time as this. Yet, as you mature and grow, He calls you to Remember the Promise&amp;mdash;who you are and what your expression of Him is to be. The Revelation of your Promise is up to Him, but you must remain open to receive that revelation. This is your Remembrance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This book is part of my journey of Remembrance as I have begun to realize again who I am and how I am to express Yahweh through time and space and even beyond. My hope is that these poems will stoke a flame of Remembrance within you, so the Holy Spirit can guide you into greater depths of who He is and who you are in Him. It is time now to Remember the Promise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
