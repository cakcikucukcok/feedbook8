      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A novel of North America&#39;s Forgotten Past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The epic tale that began in &lt;i&gt;The People of the Longhouse &lt;/i&gt;draws to a close in &lt;i&gt;People of the Black Sun, &lt;/i&gt;the final installation of the Iroquois quartet by award-winning archaeologists and &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The darkness that Dekanawida has envisioned is drawing closer, and the warring Iroquois nations have refused to listen to his message of peace and compassion. Consumed by madness, Chief Atotarho is determined to subjugate all five nations--beginning with Dekanawida&#39;s own people, the Standing Stone nation.  All who stand in his way will be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is on the field of battle that Dekanawida is given his first real advantage in his quest for peace.  A great storm appears to answer his call, scattering Atotarho&#39;s forces when they are on the verge of annihilating the Standing Stone People.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now elevated to the status of Prophet, Dekanawida must call on the aid of old friends Baji and Hiyawento to convince the hostile neighboring clans that the destruction of one nation will mean the end of them all.  Can their mission of peace succeed in time to save everyone that they love, or will their world be consumed by darkness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
