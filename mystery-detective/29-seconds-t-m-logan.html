  <title>29 Seconds - T. M. Logan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From T.M. Logan, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lies,&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;29 Seconds&lt;/i&gt;, a sensational new thriller that explores what happens when a split second thought of revenge takes on a life of its own.   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Give me one name. One person. And I will make them disappear.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah is a young professor struggling to prove herself in a workplace controlled by the charming and manipulative Alan Hawthorne. A renowned scholar and television host, Hawthorne rakes in million-dollar grants for the university where Sarah works--so his inappropriate treatment of female colleagues behind closed doors has gone unchallenged for years. And Sarah is his newest target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hawthorne&#39;s advances become threatening, Sarah is left with nowhere to turn. Until the night she witnesses an attempted kidnapping of a young child on her drive home, and impulsively jumps in to intervene. The child&#39;s father turns out to be a successful businessman with dangerous connections--and her act of bravery has put this powerful man in her debt. He gives Sarah a burner phone and an unbelievable offer. A once-in-a-lifetime deal that can make all her problems disappear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No consequences. No traces. All it takes is a 29-second phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because everyone has a name to give. Don&#39;t they?&lt;/p&gt;" />
