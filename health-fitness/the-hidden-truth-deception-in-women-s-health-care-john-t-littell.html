  <title>The Hidden Truth: Deception in Women’S Health Care - John T. Littell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no question that  women are called upon to make a variety of sacrifices during the course of their reproductive lives. Dealing with the physical, emotional and psychological demands of the monthly reproductive cycle, of pregnancy and of childrearing can prove exhausting for many  especially when coupled with the rigors of managing a home and full time employment outside the home.  So why is it that these same women have been asked  and at times, required  to make health care choices which further compromise their overall wellbeing  while men  their partners and soulmates  are left with little or no responsibility for such issues as STD prevention and birth control?
In a guidebook tailored for both women and men, a seasoned doctor combines facts and advice relevant to women and their families that will empower them to make informed decisions about future health care. Dr. John Littell, a family physician with more than twenty-five years of experience that includes obstetrics and gynecology, shares valuable insight about controversial issues in womens health care that range from HPV vaccination in children to the diagnosis and treatment of HPV-related disease to the numerous choices related to contraception and family planning. With an emphasis on natural options, Dr. Littell includes guidance and case studies related to common gynecologic health issues encountered by teenagers and women throughout their reproductive lives while exposing much of the deception in womens health care today." />
