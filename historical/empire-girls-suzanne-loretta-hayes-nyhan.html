  <title>Empire Girls - Suzanne &amp; Loretta Hayes &amp; Nyhan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The critically acclaimed authors of I&#39;ll Be Seeing You return with a riveting tale of two sisters, set in the intoxicating world of New York City during the Roaring Twenties.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ivy and Rose Adams may be sisters, but they&#39;re nothing alike. Rose, the eldest, is the responsible one, while Ivy is spirited and brazen. After the unexpected death of their father, the women are left to reconcile the estate, when they make a shocking discovery: not only has their father left them in financial ruin, but he has also bequeathed their beloved family house to a brother they never knew existed. With only a photograph to guide the way, Ivy and Rose embark to New York City, determined to find this mysterious man and reclaim what is rightfully theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once in New York, temptations abound at every turn, and soon the sisters are drawn into the glitzy underbelly of Manhattan, where they must overcome their differences and learn to trust each other if they&#39;re going to survive in the big city and find their brother. Filled with unforgettable characters and charm, Empire Girls is a love letter to 1920s New York, and a captivating story of the unspoken bond between sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
