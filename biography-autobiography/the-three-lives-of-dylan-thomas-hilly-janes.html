  <title>The Three Lives of Dylan Thomas - Hilly Janes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Dylan Thomas was one of the most extraordinary poetic talents of the twentieth century. Poems such as &amp;#145;Do not go gentle into that good night&amp;#8217; regularly top polls of the nation&amp;#8217;s favourites and his much-loved play Under Milk Wood has never been out of print.   Thomas lived a life that was rarely without incident and died a death that has gone down in legend as the epitome of Bohemian dissoluteness. In The Three Lives of Dylan Thomas, journalist Hilly Janes explores that life and its extraordinary legacy through the eyes of her father, the artist Alfred Janes, who was a member of Thomas&amp;#8217;s inner circle and painted the poet at three key moments: in 1934, 1953 and, posthumously, 1964. Using these portraits as focal points, and drawing on a personal archive that includes drawings, diaries, letters and new interviews with   omas&amp;#8217;s friends and descendants,  The Three Lives of Dylan Thomas plots the poet&amp;#8217;s tempestuous journey from his birthplace in Swansea to his early death in a New York hospital in 1953. In this innovative and powerful narrative, Hilly Janes paints her own portrait: one that ventures beneath Thomas&amp;#8217;s reputation as a feckless, disloyal, boozy Welsh bard to reveal a much more complex character.&lt;/div&gt;" />
