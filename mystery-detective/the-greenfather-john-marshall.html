  <title>The Greenfather - John Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Simon, New York&amp;#8217;s top organic grocery store owner has a secret: his dad is the head of one of New York&amp;#8217;s biggest mob families. When his dad dies, Simon agrees to head the Family, provided that instead of murder, numbers and other rackets, the mob uses its muscle to enforce green regulations and promote healthy eating habits. At first the mob&amp;#8217;s hit men and extortionists resent being pressed into green service, but they soon become Simon&amp;#8217;s biggest supporters. Seemingly overnight, the city becomes literally cleaned up. Simon, who had planned on succeeding his dad temporarily, now finds he likes his new position as the head of the Family. However, the green world doesn&amp;#8217;t accept him because he&amp;#8217;s running a crime family, and the crime world doesn&amp;#8217;t trust him because he&amp;#8217;s run afoul of the Feds. Simon takes his wife, Marla, to his ancestral homeland in Italy, for a much-needed sabbatical &amp;#150; and gets even further into trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Loosely based on Mario Puzo&#39;s runaway hit &lt;I&gt;The Godfather&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;B&gt;THE GREENFATHER&lt;/B&gt; showcases Marshall&amp;#8217;s comic dialogue, honed year after year in late night television, in the grand tradition of classic mob comedy, like Analyze This and Analyze That. Packed with larger than life goons, right-hand men, Feds and green fanatics, &lt;B&gt;THE GREENFATHER&lt;/B&gt; satirizes the environmental movement, crime, families, and crime families.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE GREENFATHER&lt;/B&gt; is sharp, hilarious, and takes no prisoners, except the ones who are supposed to go there.  It goes well with a light salad of radicchio and cherry plum tomatoes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
