  <title>Blade on the Hunt - Lauren Dane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;When you awaken, you will have to find her yourself. Or she will find you.&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;These were the words given to Rowan Summerwaite by the Goddess as Rowan lay clinging to life. Broken&amp;#151;but not defeated&amp;#151;by the ancient Vampire Enyo.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;After weeks of mandatory down time, a recharged and vengeance-fueled Rowan heads out from her father&amp;#39;s Keep, leading a team of some of the most terrifying beings on earth with one goal in mind&amp;#151;track and eliminate the Vampire who attacked her.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But as the team moves across Europe and is hit with wave after wave of attacks, the tensions between Clive Stewart&amp;#151;the haughty, stylish Scion of North America whom Rowan grew even closer to during her recovery&amp;#151;and a rival Vampire ramp up. Befuddled, confused, flattered and annoyed, Rowan&amp;#39;s the woman in the middle. She&amp;#39;s not used to being claimed in a way that&amp;#39;s not about how strong her sword arm is or who raised her. Clive Stewart is everything she shouldn&amp;#39;t want in a man&amp;#151;he&amp;#39;s bossy, he&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;Vampire&lt;/em&gt;, and he considers her his&amp;#151;but she&amp;#39;s past denying how it makes her feel that he fights for her the way he does. She&amp;#39;s past denying she&amp;#39;s in love.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;In contrast to the uneven footing falling in love has given her, Rowan is utterly certain she will locate her quarry. She&amp;#39;s stronger and more powerful than she&amp;#39;s ever been after the tests and bloody lessons of the last years. Her connection with the Goddess is seamless and the light of her mission burns from within. And she&amp;#39;ll need all the help she can get because it&amp;#39;s not very long before Rowan and her team realize the threat is far greater than one crazy old Vampire. There&amp;#39;s a war brewing and Rowan will fight it to the death. It&amp;#39;s what she was born to do." />
