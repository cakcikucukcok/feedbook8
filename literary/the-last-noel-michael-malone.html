  <title>The Last Noel - Michael Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Award-winning author Michael Malone&#39;s The Last Noel is a beautiful gift to American fiction. In a deeply touching tale, The Last Noel captures the exuberance and poignance of a lasting friendship between a man and a woman from very different backgrounds.

On that Christmas Eve, Kaye climbs through her bedroom window to invite her to come sledding with him in a rare southern snowfall. Over the next thirty years on twelve days of Christmas, they meet to share the passion, the sacrifice and the romance of a lifetime. At once exquisitely written and tearfully joyful, The Last Noel is one of the great love stories of our time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Book Sense 76 Top 10 Selection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Malone&#39;s latest novel reaffirms his brilliance in crafting carefully plotted fiction with a literary burnish, most often through Southern manners and intrigue.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Denver Post&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A warm, engaging love story.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Booklist&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Malone writes with such quiet authority and clear understanding of the world his characters inhabit that the story strikes deep emotional chords.&quot;-Washington Post Book WorldAward-winning author Michael Malone&#39;s The Last Noel is a beautiful gift to American fiction.
