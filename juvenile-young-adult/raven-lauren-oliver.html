  <title>Raven - Lauren Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This captivating 50-page digital-original story set in the world of Lauren Oliver&#39;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Delirium series focuses on Raven, the fiery leader of a rebel group in the Wilds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, Raven made the split-second decision to flee across the border to the Wilds, compelled to save an abandoned newborn&amp;#8212;a baby girl left for dead and already blue from the cold. When she and the baby are taken in by a band of rebels, Raven finds herself an outsider within a tight-knit group. The only other newcomer is an untrustworthy boy known as the Thief until he finally earns himself a new name: Tack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she and Tack are inseparable, committed to each other, the fledgling rebellion, and a future together. But as they both take center stage in the fight, Raven must decide whether the dangers of the revolution are worth risking her dreams of a peaceful life with Tack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her story hurtles back and forth between past and present, Raven transforms from a scared girl newly arrived in the Wilds to the tough leader who helps Lena save former &lt;em&gt;Deliria&lt;/em&gt;-Free poster boy Julian Fineman from a death sentence. Whatever the original mission may have been, Raven abides by a conviction that she believes to her core: You always return for the people you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turns surprising, revelatory, and poignant, Raven&#39;s story enriches the Delirium world and resonates with a voice that is as vulnerable as it is strong. &lt;/p&gt;" />
