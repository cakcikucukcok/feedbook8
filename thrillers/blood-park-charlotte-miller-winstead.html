      <meta name="description" content="BLOOD PARK
  Andy Geary was a fourth generation Chicago cop. Following in footsteps that went back to the early 1800s, Andy had been a detective for three years when the biggest case of his career landed in his lap. This was his first chance to be the lead investigator of a major crime and, because of his background, it was of the utmost importance to him that he make good.
  Five women had been murdered in a local park, their babies kidnapped. The only clues were the shattered skulls of the mothers and their childrens overturned strollers. Andy and his partner Chase Coletti worked frantically to solve the case but came up with nothing. Suddenly the murders stopped.
  Then, two years later, they began again. Same park, same walking track, same crushed skull and a missing baby. Andy had quit the force when he failed to bring the killer to justice the first time. Now his former partner was the lead investigator and drew Andy back in. This case had already cost him his career, his marriage and almost his life. Could he risk it all again to finally put an end to the killers rampage?" />
