  <title>Under His Spell - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anna&amp;#39;s life just got a lot more complicated, and that&amp;#39;s saying something considering she doesn&amp;#39;t remember anything about her past due to her memory loss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last thing she needs is two sexy alpha males, one of whom is a horned demon, fighting for her attention, but she doesn&amp;#39;t have a say in the primal pleasures they introduce to her innocent body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Anna, I&amp;#39;ve missed you so much,&amp;quot; he growled, kissing my head with lips that felt like fire. &amp;quot;Keep awake, Anna. It&amp;#39;s dangerous to sleep when you&amp;#39;re cold.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was just a little cold and sleepy, I wanted to tell him, but I was so tired and it was nice and warm in his arms. The sound of traffic disappeared suddenly and we were surrounded by an echoing silence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I yelped when he released me onto a bed and immediately tried to see where the strange man had brought me, but he was standing right in front of me and it was hard to look at anywhere else but him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His obsidian eyes and hair were as hard to ignore as his large horns, growing from his head like buffalo horns, large and imposing. He was lean but muscular, every inch of him sculpted like there wasn&amp;#39;t an ounce of fat in his body. A single loin cloth wrapped around his hips, dangerously close to falling. His skin was ashen, even in the dim light, and seem to glow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I should be afraid, but the sight of him calmed me down more than anything had. His eyes shone with unshed tears. &amp;quot;I thought I would never see you again,&amp;quot; he said, drinking in the sight of me like a man starved. &amp;quot;Do you remember me, Anna?&amp;quot; he asked even though in his eyes, he knew the answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head. &amp;quot;Mateo told me about you. But I didn&amp;#39;t believe him...&amp;quot; I felt my face heat up as I looked at him. It was difficult not to stare at how low the cloth was hanging on his hips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Under his direct stare, I was beginning to find it harder and harder to fall asleep. My heart began to beat in a hectic staccato.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What are you?&amp;quot; I asked. When had he gotten so close? I was shaking even though it was starting to grow warmer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of answering, his knuckle lightly grazed across my collar bone. I drew in a shuddering breath of air as his finger gently glided from the delicate bone and teased up my neck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dante-&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt him tense when I said his name. His eyes closed and emitting low, inhuman noises from deep in his throat, he climbed onto the bed with me. &amp;quot;Perhaps your body remembers me,&amp;quot; he growled." />
