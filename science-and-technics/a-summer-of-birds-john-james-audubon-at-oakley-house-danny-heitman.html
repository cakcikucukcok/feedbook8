  <title>A Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House - Danny Heitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the summer of 1821 began, John James Audubon&#39;s ambition to create a comprehensive pictorial record of American birds was still largely a dream. Then, out of economic necessity, Audubon came to Oakley Plantation, a sprawling estate in Louisiana&#39;s West Feliciana Parish. Teeming with an abundance of birds, the woods of Oakley galvanized Audubon&#39;s sense of possibility for one of the most audacious undertakings in the annals of art. &lt;br&gt;In A Summer of Birds, journalist and essayist Danny Heitman sorts through the facts and romance of Audubon&#39;s summer at Oakley, a season that clearly shaped the destiny of the world&#39;s most famous bird artist. Heitman draws from a rich variety of sources -- including Audubon&#39;s own extensive journals, more recent Audubon scholarship, and Robert Penn Warren&#39;s poetry -- to create a stimulating excursion across time, linking the historical man Audubon to the present-day civic and cultural icon. He considers the financial straits that led to Audubon&#39;s employment at Oakley as a private tutor to fifteen-year-old Eliza Pirrie, Audubon&#39;s family history, his flamboyance as a master of self-invention, his naturalist and artistic techniques, and the possible reasons for his dismissal. Illustrations include photographs of Oakley House -- now a state historic site -- Audubon&#39;s paintings from his Oakley period, and portraits of the Pirrie family members. &lt;br&gt;A favorable combination of climate and geography made Oakley a birding haven, and Audubon completed or began at least twenty-three bird paintings -- among his finest work -- while staying there. A Summer of Birds will inform and delight readers in its exploration of this eventful but unsung 1821 interlude, a fascinating chapter in the life of America&#39;s foremost bird artist. It is an indispensable pleasure for birders, Audubon enthusiasts, and visitors to Oakley House.&lt;/p&gt;" />
