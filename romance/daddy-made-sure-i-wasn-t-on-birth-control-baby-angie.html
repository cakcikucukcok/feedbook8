  <title>Daddy Made Sure I Wasn’t On Birth Control - Baby Angie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A cute, naive young girl, just having celebrated her 18th birthday weeks earlier, was asked that one question NO daughter should ever hear from her father. He asked her if she was on the pill! When she said &amp;#39;no&amp;#39;, daddy smiled and showed his darling angel that there are still plenty of monsters in the world! She had no idea that 12 inches could be so thick!!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I looked up at daddy and had an epiphany. He was right. Being treated like shit made my pussy ache for a big, thick cock. &amp;ldquo;Daddy, can you fuck me hard?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Daddy smiled down at me, even as he was shaking the last drops of piss and told me something which only made me realize how much he loved me. &amp;ldquo;Sweetheart, I&amp;rsquo;m going to fuck you so hard, you just may have to go to the emergency room later. You are such a slut.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I smiled up at daddy. &amp;ldquo;Does this mean I&amp;rsquo;m still your little princess?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Daddy didn&amp;rsquo;t answer me with words. His answer came in the form of his leather belt, which he used to whip the living shit out of me. My tits, shoulders, my whole body was treated to his savage blows. The harder he whipped me, the closer I came to an overwhelming orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;THAT&amp;rsquo;S RIGHT DADDY, BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME! DO ME DADDY!&amp;rdquo;" />
