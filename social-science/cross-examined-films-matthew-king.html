  <title>Cross-Examined Films - Matthew King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After spending nearly a quarter of a lifetime watching popular and independent films, Matthew King, RN, makes a point to criticize the Christian church for its lack of engagement with films. He believes that the lack of engagement and the strong denunciation of films only because of their sexual or violent content has lost an entire generation because of the inability to speak the millennial language of popular Hollywood films. With searing prose and biting confrontation, King attempts to engage films through the lens of theology, philosophy, and political analysis to assist the church in identifying positive as well as negative examples of the topics within to better engage an entire generation. Through this investigation, Christians and non-Christians alike will be both enlightened and surprised at what popular films have unconsciously taught them from a young age." />
