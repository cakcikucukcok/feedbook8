  <title>Emergency Contact (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Dead Bolt, Book 4) - Susan Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BEAUTIFUL WEAPON&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tess woke up naked, confused…and without a single memory. But she knew something terrible was about to happen. She could trust no one, but Dr. Ryan Donovan&#39;s soothing voice calmed her fears and called to her woman&#39;s heart. The trouble was, he worked for the enemy….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan had heard of sleepers before…ordinary men and women brainwashed to perform horrible acts, but he couldn&#39;t believe Tess was capable of violence. She was beautiful and funny, and in desperate need of a protector. But when her nightmares increased, the clock began ticking down. If Ryan wanted to protect Tess, he had to first betray his closest of allies, and then stop her at all costs….&lt;/p&gt;
