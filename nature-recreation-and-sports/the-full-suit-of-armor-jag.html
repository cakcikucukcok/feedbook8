JAG has been told that since the dawn of Reasoning, man has asked questions. The Full Suit of Armor is the compilation of answers and conclusions that JAG has found through his journey of life thus far. Each chapter is a book that centers around a main theme usually the chapter title. These smaller books have been combined to form the Full Suit the individual titles have been written over the last twenty-five years.

By sharing The Full Suit of Armor to all who choose to read its content, it is JAGs prayer that it benefits each of you in a positive manner." />
