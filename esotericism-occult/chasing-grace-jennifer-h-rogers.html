  <title>Chasing Grace - Jennifer H. Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chasing Grace is the story of a boy who wanted nothing more than to leave his troubled life behind him, but what he found instead is a cast of mystical and loving sea creatures beneath the waves who taught him that grace is abundant and ever-present, even in the most unlikely places! Chasing Grace is a testament to the optimism and hope that children often have, but like us, they need a gentle reminder to hold steady to that outlook through compassion for others and gratitude for the gifts we often take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing Grace tells the intriguing story of a childs journey to find grace. This story ministers to children and parents of children searching for hope, love, and purpose. Jennifer gives readers an opportunity to explore their own lives through the eyes of Chase and to be uplifted by important discoveries that change his life and the readers for the better. The sea creatures come alive as they guide Chase on his journey to discover what is already inside of him. This book explores the heart of a child and reveals special gifts through colorful imagery a gift to be shared with children and parents everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Sheila Sturgis Craig, Director of the Center for Elimination of Disproportionality and Disparities, &lt;br /&gt;Texas Health and Human Services Commission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing Grace is a tender and poignant story that is all too common for children healing from painful experiences. Jennifer paints a beautiful story of how love and grace can conquer fear and pain. Her story personifies Gods gift of grace that is available to each of us and underscores the inherent value of each child. She provides thought-provoking discussion starters inspired by her own experience working with system-involved children. This book is particularly well-suited for parents, counselors and other childcare professionals who are helping children of all ages understand the lessons that can be gleaned during or after distressing situations.&lt;br /&gt;Tammy Holland, Manager of Family, Community, and Chaplaincy Programs, &lt;br /&gt;Texas Juvenile Justice Department&lt;/p&gt;" />
