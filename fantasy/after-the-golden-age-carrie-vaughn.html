  <title>After the Golden Age - Carrie Vaughn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;After the Golden Age&lt;/i&gt;, a stand-alone urban fantasy by bestselling author Carrie  Vaughn features the thoroughly mundane daughter of two famous superheroes, who finds in herself an unlikely hero. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not easy being a superhero&#39;s daughter....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie Vaughn has captured legions of fans with her wildly popular Kitty Norville novels. Now she uses her extraordinary wit and imagination to tell a sensational new story about superhuman heroes-and the people who have to live with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people dream of having superheroes for parents, but not Celia West. The only daughter of Captain Olympus and Spark, the world&#39;s greatest champions, she has no powers of her own, and the most exciting thing she&#39;s ever done is win a silver medal in a high school swim meet. Meanwhile, she&#39;s the favorite hostage of every crime boss and supervillain in Commerce City. She doesn&#39;t have a code name, but if she did, it would probably be Bait Girl, the Captive Wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejecting her famous family and its legacy, Celia has worked hard to create a life for herself beyond the shadow of their capes, becoming a skilled forensic accountant. But when her parents&#39; archenemy, the Destructor, faces justice in the &quot;Trial of the Century,&quot; Celia finds herself sucked back into the more-than-mortal world of Captain Olympus-and forced to confront a secret that she hoped would stay buried forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
