In this spirited comedy of manners Catherine Morland, a plain, unspoiled small-town girl on holiday in Bath, meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, a handsome young clergyman. Henry&amp;#39;s father, believing Catherine to be wealthy, invites her to be a guest at Northanger Abby, the family&amp;#39;s country estate. Catherine, who has read too many Gothic romances and who is possessed of too vivid an imagination, views the abbey as a house of nightmarish horror &amp;mdash; an aspect of the book that gleefully parodies the fantastic Gothic romances by Ann Radcliffe and other popular writers of the period. An amusing assortment of misunderstandings and plot twists result in the satisfying romantic conclusion characteristic of the author&amp;rsquo;s works.&lt;br /&gt;
First written in 1789-99, when Austen was in her early twenties, this novel, like&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Persuasion,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;did not see publication till 1818, in the winter after the author&amp;#39;s death. Distinguished by its satirical wit, brilliant comedy, and complex but subtle views of human nature and morality, the book also presents a fine background picture of middle-class life in nineteenth-century England, with particularly good scenes in Bath, the fashionable watering place to which Austen&amp;#39;s father, a clergyman himself, had retired.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Northanger Abbey&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a must-read for all Austen fans and students of English literature." />

Northanger Abbey isn't a title commonly heard of, but after my desperate need to collect all of Austen's works, I stumbled upon the vintage classics edition of this beautifully and wittily written book.<br /><b><i>Northanger Abbey: Austen, Jane: 9781543226690: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Novel by Jane Austen, published posthumously in 1817. Northanger Abbey, which was published with Persuasion in four volumes, was written about 1798 or 1799, probably under the title "Susan." In 1803 the manuscript of "Susan" was sold to the publisher Richard Crosby, who advertised for it, but unaccountably it was not published at that time.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Northanger Abbey (9781612930848): Austen, Jane ...</i></b> | JANE AUSTEN (1775-1817) was extremely modest about her own genius but has become one of English literature's most famous women writers.She is the author of Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, and Mansfield Park. MARILYN BUTLER is rector of Exeter College, Oxford.She has also edited Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent and Ennui for Penguin Classics.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Northanger Abbey (Best Navigation, Active TOC) (A to Z Classics) - Jane Austen, AtoZ Classics</a> </h3></p><hr/>
