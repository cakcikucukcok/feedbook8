  <title>The Ufo–Christianity Connection - Fred R. David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For many centuries, science and religion have remained staunchly independent. Whenever issues have developed that simultaneously touched on both areas, debate often ensuedfor example, when scientists first proposed that the earth revolved around the sun, or when the theory of evolution was proposed. There has always been a cultural disconnect between science and religion that has caused dissention and distrust. Research conducted by author Fred R. David, however, reveals that the missing link between science and religion may be UFOs or, more specifically, the beings inside those crafts. &lt;/p&gt;
