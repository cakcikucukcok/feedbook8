  <title>Divine Indwelling: Key to the Wisdom, Knowledge and Power of God from Within Man - Bro. Josefino T. Rona</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If I have to write all the experiences and miracles in my life it would be volumes. All these miracles come from One Source: the power of DIVINE INDWELLING. These stories are not fictions. They are real experiences of miracles that made me write the book in order to share with people who with their FAITH can get into the Threshold of God&#39;s Presence within the soul and let the LIGHT of God&#39;s Power shine forth to drive evil away. The Truth is in the book. The Process, that even a little child can do, is in the book. But for one story among hundreds of stories, let me share this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A male teenager came to my office at midnight, trembling pale drunk high with drugs, carrying a knife urged by his hallucinations to kill someone, and that was me. I knew at that moment the Lord sent this poor guy to me to be healed by the power of God&#39;s Divine Indwelling. Gently yet carefully I led him to God&#39;s Presence within him, and with the power of the prayer of faith, Iby the power of God simply commanded the evil of drug addiction to leave. Right at that moment the guy was healed. The power of God in the soul of believers is truly REAL.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I can share several stories of my experiences of miracles because of God&#39;s Divine Indwelling, the very &quot;key that opens all the treasures of God&#39;s wisdom and knowledge&quot; (Col 2:2-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who is serious in following what is written in this book can also see the experience of the power of God. Hence I wrote the book to help as many as are looking for hope and peace within them. Praise our awesome God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
