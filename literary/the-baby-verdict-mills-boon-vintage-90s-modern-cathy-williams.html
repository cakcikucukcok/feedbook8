          &lt;strong&gt;Assignment: baby?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jessica had tried hard to play down her attractiveness at work. She wasn&#39;t interested in office affairs, or so she thought until company boss Bruno Carr personally assigned her to work closely with him on a major lawsuit… . Jessica knew she&#39;d won Bruno&#39;s professional respect.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She also sensed that he saw beyond her neat suits and cool manner - both of which Jessica was forced to abandon on a Caribbean business trip… . Steamy, sensual nights followed, but was it more than an affair? The only verdict Jessica could be certain of was that she was now expecting her boss&#39;s baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;She&#39;s sexy, successful… and PREGNANT!&lt;/em&gt;
