  <title>The Great Poplar Mystery - Giovanni Volpi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Po Valley, Italy: Tappo, a chipper little dog, lives on an old farm. He feels like a real boss guarding the area between the courtyard and the great poplar at the end of the fields. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any real friends, but a few good relationships like those with the wonderful cat, Lucy and the owl, Rosina, together with the hens and the other dogs that live on the farm. However, Tappo also has some enemies, like the river rats and unwelcome cats.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, life carries on quite well until one day some frightening news arrives that turns everything around and threatens the future of the farm animals. Then like the shocks in a thriller, a succession of dramatic turn of events takes place and Tappo becomes a detective in this strange situation where nothing is as it seems. In order to discover who is moving in the shadows and to save everyone, he is faced with making a decision that will change his whole life and his opinion of the other animals. But will it be the right choice?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
