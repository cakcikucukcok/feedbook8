  <title>When the Sleeping Giant Awakens Within - Nancy L. Briggs, Alan Snell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This supernatural thriller takes a lighthearted look at the heavy-handed in the spiritual world. It is the true story of one womans courage and determination to overcome supernatural targeted oppression and suppression against all odds. Seemingly alone and defenseless, divine intervention would reveal itself time and time again to turn the tide in her favor to insure not only her survival, but her thrival.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a trip to the inner heart and soul, in order to survive the external forces that were determined to force fear, destruction, carnage, and chaos. It is a feminine perspective and survivors guide when you find yourself confronted with the dark side of the supernatural, intended to lighten the load of a burden she carried for twelve years.&lt;br /&gt;
The battles were supernatural, the fight with the unseen forces was never fair or provoked, and came out of the blue and at random. The choices of others and the universal laws of attraction had unleashed a war zone in her personal life after the events of 9/11, and she had to discover for herself how to cleanse, clean, and clear it out of her life. This is a journey of discovery of the self. We heal, we reveal, we recover to assist others who struggle with dark days and deeds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
