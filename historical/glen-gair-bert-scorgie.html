The coming of the Schemes transformed the Highland Glens beyond all recognition and brought wealth to many of the remote parts of the Scottish Highlands. The work site was short lived and most were completed in about five years. The workmen would move on and many of the younger local men would go with them, lost to their native Glen forever.
