  <title>Industrial Hydraulic Systems: Theory and Practice - Joji Parambath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Industrial Hydraulic Systems provides an in-depth coverage of conventional hydraulic systems encompassing fixed-displacement pumps, control valves, and actuators as well as the most modern hydraulic systems encompassing highly efficient variable-displacement pumps, electro-hydraulic proportional valves and/or servo valves with integrated electronics. The coverage is further supplemented by many typical hydraulic and electro-hydraulic circuits. Details of different types of auxiliary devices such as reservoirs, filters, accumulators, and piping have also been described in this book. Topics on hydrostatic transmission, cartridge valves, load sensing pump controls, fluids, filters, and seals are given in detail. Design, installation, and maintenance aspects of hydraulic systems are added to make the book more useful to actual practitioners of these systems. Understanding the fundamental laws and principles allows the reader to use basic theoretical concepts in practical applications. The unique feature of this textbook is that all quantities are given in the SI system as well as in the English system of units. This book provides an extensive coverage of fluid power to designers, engineers, technicians, and students of engineering colleges, polytechnics, and vocational training institutes. This book, prepared especially with an academic interest in mind, contains a large number of numerical examples, design problems, and sections for &amp;#39;Test your Knowledge&amp;#39; and end of chapter questions. This book is intended to provide the most current information available on hydraulic technology.&lt;/p&gt;" />
