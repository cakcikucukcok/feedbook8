      <meta name="description" content="Words. Words are part of our every day life, whatever our language, creed or background. Words have power that little else can match; they can make you happy or make you weep with sadness, they can cause great pain or, alternatively inspire great courage. Where will words take you? What will you do with them? What will you feel?
This collection of poetry essentially consists of two sections: Hindsight, which mainly pertains to aspects of the First  World War, including humour. It is nor just for readers with military interest and, although the main message is Remembrance, it is also relevant to anyone, everyone who has experienced laughter, grief, irony, hope in adversity and the strength of human friendship. Explanations discuss historic detail referred to within the poems.
The second section, &#39;Words&#39; contains verse on other subjects, from Hamlet spoofs to and ode about Scotland.
All works, illustrations included , are the original work of the author" />
