  <title>The Good Patient - Kristin Waterfield Duisberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brilliant, acerbic, funny, and relentless, Darien Gilbertson appears to have it all: a successful career, a husband who loves her absolutely, and all the material comforts of a New York life. But Darien is in trouble - on the run from her emotions, and from a past that resurrects itself in acts of self-mutilation she neither understands nor cares to explore. After years of good behavior, Darien is hurting herself again. And this time it&#39;s so brutal that her husband, Robert, cannot help but recognize the woman he adores is unraveling before his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darien has a history with therapists. She knows exactly what they want - and need - to hear. She has made a game of psychotherapy, spinning outrageous fictions, exposing her doctors&#39; vanities, knowing when to reveal just a little of the truth. When Robert brings her to Dr. Lindholm, she is ready. But in Dr. Lindholm Darien may have met her match: a caring psychiatrist with the patience and skill to see beneath her façade. At once intrigued and resistant, Darien engages Dr. Lindholm in a battle of wits, sure only her pride is at stake. When she stumbles instead upon a buried truth about herself the consequences are devastating, threatening her marriage, her identity, and what she understands about life and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristin Waterfield Duisberg&#39;s&lt;i&gt; The Good Patient&lt;/i&gt; is about interiors and exteriors, knowledge and perception, the treachery and triumph of memory. Written in razor-sharp, sparkling prose, it is a story that takes dead aim at a question we all fear: how well do we really know the people we love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
