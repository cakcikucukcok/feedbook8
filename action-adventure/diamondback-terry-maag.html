  <title>Diamondback - Terry Maag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story takes place near and in the surroundings of two towns in modern western America. It involves youth and some problems with drugs and alcohol. An outside influence from the big city is ultimately drawn into the plot adding to the intrigue. The story resides within the moral boundaries set in the modern American west, involving adult humor and situations. A crime is committed under a unique set of circumstances which sets off a chain of events that keeps the action moving 24 hours a day. Anyone who has lived or worked in rural America can identfy with the characters and situations in this book. It is moderately intense, yet enjoyable to read.
The plot takes place in the time frame of approxamately two days. It has humor, but there are undercurents of a more serious nature. Some of the characters are likeable in a plot that builds and invites a surprise ending.
George Norton, the sheriff of Beaumont County, is filling the shoes of his former mentor, John Madison, who is now a federal marshal. It is George&#39;s job to insure and protect the integrity of some of the more promenent citizens. George thinks he has seen it all, but the future of America brings itself in the form of it&#39;s youth along with their trappings. The generation gaps are evident and lend to providing a learning curve for all involved. For a short time at least, they &quot;wake up&quot; the would be sleepy nature of this small town, rural America." />
