  <title>The Greek Plays - Ellen McLaughlin, Tony Kushner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;From &lt;I&gt;The Persians&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Defeat is impossible&lt;BR&gt;Defeat is unthinkable&lt;BR&gt;We have always been the favorites of fate.&lt;br&gt;Fortune has cupped us&lt;BR&gt;In her golden palms.&lt;BR&gt;It has only been a matter&lt;BR&gt;Of choosing our desire. Which fruit&lt;BR&gt;To pick from the nodding tree.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This chilling passage is from Ellen McLaughlin&amp;rsquo;s new adaptation of &lt;I&gt;The Persians &lt;/I&gt;by Aeschylus, the earliest surviving play in Western literature, an elegy for a fallen civi-lization and a warning to its new conqueror. As Margo Jefferson wrote in the &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt;, &quot;The play is a true classic: we see the present and the future right there, inside the past. And when writers give us a &amp;lsquo;new version&amp;rsquo; (a translation or adaptation) of a classic, they both serve and use it. They serve the playwright&amp;rsquo;s gifts by refusing to simplify. But they can&amp;rsquo;t just imitate. Every age has its own rhythms and drives. The classic must make us feel the new acutely. Ellen McLaughlin serves and uses &lt;I&gt;The Persians &lt;/I&gt;with true power and grace.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also included in this volume: &lt;I&gt;Iphigenia and Other Daughters &lt;/I&gt;(from Euripides and Sophocles); &lt;I&gt;The Trojan Women &lt;/I&gt;(Euripides); &lt;I&gt;Helen &lt;/I&gt;(Euripides); and &lt;I&gt;Lysistrata &lt;/I&gt;(Aristophanes), all powerfully realized and as relevant today as when they were first performed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ellen McLaughlin&amp;rsquo;s plays include &lt;I&gt;Days and Nights Within, A Narrow Bed, Infinity&amp;rsquo;s House&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Tongue of a Bird&lt;/I&gt;, which have been widely produced. She is a past finalist for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and was the co-winner of the Great American Play Contest. Also an accomplished actor, Ms. McLaughlin is most known for having originated the part of the Angel in Tony Kushner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;I&gt;Angels in America&lt;/I&gt;, appearing in every U.S. production through its Broadway run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
