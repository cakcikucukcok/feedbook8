  <title>Come Love a Stranger - Kathleen E. Woodiwiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A woman with no name and no memory...The two men who claim her:one with love, the other with fear...A dazzling tale of secret passions--and a love tragically lost and miraculously reborn--by the incomparable storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mere days after Ashton Wingate&#39;s wedding to the enchanting Lierin, capricious Fate stole the Mississippi plantation owner&#39;s beloved from him.  Now, three years later, his carriage has collided with a cloaked rider on horseback:  a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to the young bride who was swallowed up by the merciless river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She awakens from unconsciousness in his magnificent home with no memory of who she is.  Yet the tenderness of this noble, caring stranger who lovingly calls her &quot;Lierin&quot; soon captures her heart and inflames her with wanting.  Then another enters their lives, threatening to destroy the happiness they have rediscovered in each other&#39;s arms--the dark and dangerous Malcolm Sinclair, who claims the enigmatic beauty is, in fact, his own wife, Lenore.  But Ashton has sworn that he will not lose his adored one a second time, and he will risk any peril to preserve their newfound joy--no matter what the unremembered secrets of his lady&#39;s past ultimately reveal.&lt;/p&gt;LIERIN&lt;p&gt;With no name and no memory, she awakens from a nightmare of madness into the lives of two stranger. One she desires, one she fears--but both have claimed her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To handsome plantation owner Ashton Wingate, she is Lierin--the cherished bride cruelly stolen from him by capricious Fate. The other calls her Lenore--entangling the lost, tormented beauty in his sinister web of perilous deceit. But it is in the adoring arms of noble Ashton that her true destiny awaits--as they join together to unlock the mysteries of a shadowed past. . .and to rekindle the flames of a glorious love once vanished but never forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;" />
