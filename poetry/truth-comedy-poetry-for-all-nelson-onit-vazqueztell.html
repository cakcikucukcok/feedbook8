  <title>Truth, Comedy &amp; Poetry for All - Nelson Onit Vazqueztell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;CENTER&quot;&gt;In a time of grief over his first romantic misunderstanding, Nelson realized that his feelings had to be expressed.  Worrying about not wanting to bore anyone with his problems and realizing the amount of long hours he worked in front of a computer, he realized that writing out exactly what was felt during intense moments seemed to ease the pain.  Not knowing that there would soon be a whole collection of poems as he continued writing about other romantic situations, he made the poems into a file that would be kept only for himself.  After meeting someone very special, his first true love, he wrote much more and made the file into a chapter that would at some point be made into a complete book including other serious and comic poems.  And so, this book is a collection of four chapters that examine humor, family, love and the world around him. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;CENTER&quot;&gt;After having won multiple contests, being published by Poetry.com, and drawing a crowd of interested readers by being placed regularly in Berkeley Colleges school newsletter, Nelson is finally releasing all of his earliest work for others to read.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;CENTER&quot;&gt;The &quot;New Poet&quot; hopes that his honesty, creativity, comic wit and deepest feelings will get others into reading, understanding, writing, and most importantly, enjoying the art of poetry.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;CENTER&quot;&gt;Truth, Comedy, &amp; Poetry for All&lt;/I&gt; is the new American Dream.&lt;/P&gt;" />
