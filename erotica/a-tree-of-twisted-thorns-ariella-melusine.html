  <title>A Tree of Twisted Thorns - Ariella Melusine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A Tree of Twisted Thorns is an erotic sibling thriller about a woman struggling with the demons of her past while fighting the forbidden temptations surrounding her. She learns that her family home is filled with twisted secrets, and darkness is lurking around every corner. To retain her sanity, she must win a very dangerous game!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Why was it that the one person she loved more than anyone besides her children was forbidden to her? Why was it that because he was her sibling, society deemed any type of sexual relationship between them sick and twisted?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Damnit.&amp;rdquo; She averted her gaze from his when she felt tears stinging her eyes. A moment later, her brother pulled her into his lap. He lifted her chin and stared intently into her eyes when he asked, &amp;ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this? Are you absolutely certain you won&amp;rsquo;t have any regrets?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her heart skipped a beat, and she felt her muscles loosening as the melancholy slid off her shoulders. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care what is supposedly right or wrong, and anyway, if what Carl or Mother is doing is right, then I&amp;rsquo;d rather be wrong, and if wrong feels so good, then maybe, just maybe, it&amp;rsquo;s not such a bad thing,&amp;rdquo; she said in a rush of words.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rollo&amp;rsquo;s lips met hers, and his hands slid down her back and under her tee-shirt. Morgan shivered at his electrifying touch, and her insides began heating up as the seconds passed. When he undid her bra, and his hands gently cupped her breasts, she began kissing him harder, throwing all other thoughts away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hands began sliding down her body, causing shockwaves to course through her. She cried out loudly, and when he slipped off her shorts and slid his fingers under her panties, she was undone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She helped him finish undressing her and pulled off his pants and boxers. Seeing his large dick made her heart skip a beat. She began stroking it slowly, sensuously, her fingers making their way down the shaft to the balls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rollo groaned and slipped his finger into her pussy, which was burning up and wet with her desire. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait any longer. He had to feel himself inside her, so he pushed her down on the couch and entered that hot pussy, which tightened around his dick, making him moan in pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Morgan&amp;rsquo;s insides quivered when he entered her, and she threw her head back and rode the waves of pleasure when he began thrusting his dick deeper and deeper. His finger slid to her clit a moment later, and Morgan felt her body quivering as spasms of pure bliss rushed over her. She began gasping and panting as the orgasm broke free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rollo&amp;rsquo;s body was coursing with sensations that made him lose all reason, and he began thrusting harder, his dick throbbing as the pleasure intensified. He moaned loudly, and sweat streaked down his face as his dick made one more thrust. His eyes seemed to lose focus as the waves of warm, wild pleasure rushed up to overtake him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he came to his senses, the usual doubts crept into his mind, but Morgan&amp;rsquo;s expression quickly brushed them aside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have no regrets. It was wonderful.&amp;rdquo; She smiled that beautiful smile that lit up her face, and Rollo&amp;rsquo;s eyes gleamed happily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, it was.&amp;rdquo; He pulled her close, crushing her to his chest. After tonight, there&amp;rsquo;d be no going back." />
