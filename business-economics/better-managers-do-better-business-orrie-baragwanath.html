  <title>Better Managers Do Better Business - Orrie Baragwanath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the past thirty years I have been lecturing groups and doing productivity consulting for a number of very different factories, businesses and agricultural enterprises. I have identified those factors which make management effective and have categorized the types of managers and the stumbling blocks to effective management by each of the types.
In discussion with my son, who has his masters degree in business management, and he asked me to put my experiences and theories on paper and to do it in the same manner I use when give seminars on the subject. In my lectures I illustrate the positive factors and the stumbling blocks by giving down to earth examples from my experiences, but at the same time illustrating, constantly, that the principles of effective management are common to all managers at whatever level of management from the MD running an airline to the farmer planting tomatoes or the janitor getting the cleaning lady to sweep the passage or the mother attempting to control her philistines in the supermarket.
I have given an explanation of where and how adults learn their management skills and have defined the four basic management types which are, in my experience, most common. My categories and definitions of the types are original and play a fundamental role in the effectiveness of participative management. They also have an elementary function in building self esteem and pride which is cardinal in assisting all levels of management to motivate subordinates and delegate responsibility. Motivation and delegation being the two most common factors where so many managers lack the fundamentals to be great managers of large companies instead of small time operators with many regrets. 
The categories I have defined are easily identifiable. African history is littered with the worst types of managers and those of Europe and Latin America stand out like sore thumbs. And the reason is that they never learnt how to motivate or delegate properly. Autocrats have to be tyrannical and greedy because they do not have the management skills to be admired and venerated in their own rite. Their recognition comes from elsewhere. It has to be so. It is a given. All tyrants began as well liked and respected people but end up as psychopaths. 
Accompanying effective management of the individual is the limitation of one&#39;s management style in delegation, the primary limiting factor in management and the core malady in administration at all levels. Effective delegation requires a structured step by step adherence to principles of esteem building, checking, selection and training. Anything less is doomed to failure and ineffectiveness." />
