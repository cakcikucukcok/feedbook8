  <title>20,000 Leagues under the Sea -  Jules Verne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &amp;quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&amp;quot;, Verne created a character, Captain Nemo, who would continue to haunt the imagination of generations to come in the manner of Homer&amp;rsquo;s hero, from whom Nemo took his name. In the &amp;quot;Odyssey&amp;quot; (c. 725 b.c.e.; English translation, 1614), Ulysses calls himself Nemo, or &amp;ldquo;No one,&amp;rdquo; in order to hide his identity from the Cyclops. Verne&amp;rsquo;s unknown renegade, making war on injustice, has likewise become a myth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best known of Verne&amp;rsquo;s works was also the one that took the longest to find its way into print. It is certain that the author was working on a story tentatively titled &amp;ldquo;Voyage Under the Waters&amp;rdquo; in 1865. After his exploration of the air in &amp;quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&amp;quot; and his &amp;quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&amp;quot;, it was logical that Verne would pursue his pedagogical mission by exploring the bottom of the sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel focuses on a group of scientists embarking on a dangerous voyage in a submarine piloted by the eccentric Captain Nemo in search of a giant monster. As the journey wears on, the crew encounters dangerous life forms, but the biggest threat to their safety may be their increasingly mad captain...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Considered one of the greatest science-fiction novels ever written, &amp;quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&amp;quot; explores themes of culture, class, grief, and the preservation of the environment. It is considered one of the forerunners of the ecology movement and displays a great respect for the life of the sea." />
