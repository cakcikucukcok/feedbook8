  <title>The Graf Zeppelin - Paul Cozens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book is a historical fiction. This means that the characters are fictional as are their exploits, but the story line is based on historical fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are unaware that during WWII, Nazi Germany had an operational aircraft carrier, the Graf Zeppelin. Had the &lt;i&gt;Graf Zeppelin&lt;/i&gt; sortied with &lt;i&gt;Bismarck&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tirpitz&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Prinz Eugen&lt;/i&gt; into the Atlantic in 1939, the entire outcome of the war could have been changed. However, due to an ongoing feud between Hermann Gring and Admiral Erich Raeder, the carrier was not allowed aircraft and she sat out the war as an ineffective white elephant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnther Schmidt is assigned the task of obtaining intelligence on the US Navy, specifically about carrier aviation. He places a young frulein, Karen Berr, in a girls college in Pensacola, Florida, where she meets a naval pilot, LTJG John Parker and falls in love, subsequently marrying him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermann Gring hates the &lt;i&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/i&gt; with a passion, and Gnther embarrasses him in front of Hitler, thus becoming a personal enemy. Gnther is targeted by Gring for assassination. Gring, who is in charge of aircraft production, makes the decision to prevent the &lt;i&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/i&gt; from having navalized aircraft. Gnther is tasked with training pilots for the German Navy in landing techniques for carriers. He sets up a clandestine training facility at Greifswald on the Baltic, flying brightly colored aircraft to misdirect Grings goons. Subsequently, Gnther becomes involved in advising German naval designers in the development of an aircraft carrier. Gring tries to have Gnther assassinated but fails, only killing his wife, Gertrude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gring hosts a big military bash and brags to Japans ambassador, Baron Hiroshi Oshima, about Germanys plan for world conquest. Oshima sends a report via the oceanic cable to Japan, unaware that the American Navy has broken the diplomatic code and are reading these messages. The transcripts are codenamed Magic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish Civil War erupts, giving Gnther and his newly trained pilots on-the-job training. Gnther helps Messerschmitt in developing the Bf 109T naval fighter and a dive bomber, the Ju 87 G. Gring tries again to assassinate Gnther and fails. Gnther, using misdirection, manages to have the naval aircraft manufactured and hidden from Gring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World War II erupts and Gnther sails into combat on the &lt;i&gt;Graf Zeppelin&lt;/i&gt; as her CAG when she sorties with &lt;i&gt;Tirpitz&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bismarck&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Prinz Eugen&lt;/i&gt;. German dive bombers from the &lt;i&gt;Graf Zeppelin&lt;/i&gt; sink two British cruisers in the Denmark Strait and assist in sinking the &lt;i&gt;Hood&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/i&gt;. The German flotilla is attacked by British torpedo airplanes, which loses all but one due to the intervention of the Bf 109T fighters. &lt;i&gt;Tirpitz&lt;/i&gt; is hit by several torpedoes and must retire. The American Coast Guard Cutter, &lt;i&gt;Modoc&lt;/i&gt;, is attacked by German dive bombers, thus bringing America into the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German flotilla joins up with &lt;i&gt;Gneisenau&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;Scharnhrst&lt;/i&gt;  to begin decimating the convoys. An American flotilla, including &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt;  and &lt;i&gt;Ranger&lt;/i&gt;, intervenes. The resulting battle ends with the destruction of the German flotilla. Gnther is captured by the Americans. &lt;/p&gt;" />
