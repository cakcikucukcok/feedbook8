  <title>Fishbowl - Bradley Somer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A goldfish named Ian is falling from the 27th-floor balcony on which his fishbowl sits. He&#39;s longed for adventure, so when the opportunity arises, he escapes from his bowl, clears the balcony railing and finds himself airborne. Plummeting toward the street below, Ian witnesses the lives of the Seville on Roxy residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s the handsome grad student, his girlfriend, and the other woman; the construction worker who feels trapped by a secret; the building&#39;s super who feels invisible and alone; the pregnant woman on bed rest who craves a forbidden ice cream sandwich; the shut-in for whom dirty talk, and quiche, are a way of life; and home-schooled Herman, a boy who thinks he can travel through time. Though they share time and space, they have something even more important in common: each faces a decision that will affect the course of their lives. Within the walls of the Seville are stories of love, new life, and death, of facing the ugly truth of who one has been and the beautiful truth of who one can become. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes taking a risk is the only way to move forward with our lives. As Ian the goldfish knows, &quot;An entire life devoted to a fishbowl will make one die an old fish with not one adventure had.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley Somer&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Fishbowl&lt;/i&gt; is at turns funny and heartbreaking and you will, no doubt, fall in love with his unforgettable characters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
