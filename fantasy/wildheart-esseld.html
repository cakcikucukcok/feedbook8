  <title>Wildheart - Esseld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A young unicorn mare, Star Wildheart, lives at Peaceful Valley, where her loving mother, Elese, has educated her as a healer. But Elese smothers Stars wildness and tries to protect her by warding her Awareness. Star is restless and angry. Yet to have the freedom she has always longed for, Star will have to find a way to turn war into peace, hatred into friendship, and fear into compassion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When a demon-wolf is freed and brings with him the ancient magic of the Chosen and Protector, everything Star has worked for is threatened. As the ancient magics try to take her over, Star risks losing her friends, her lover, her freedom and even herself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wildheart&lt;/i&gt; is a story about the power of the things we have in common, the reasons we believe, and the compassion it takes to save the world.&lt;/P&gt;" />
