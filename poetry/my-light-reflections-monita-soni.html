  <title>My Light Reflections - Monita Soni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To read Dr. Monita Soni&#39;s My Light Reflections, is to try and take the measure of light in its myriad illuminations, the shifting rays that color a landscape stretching from Huntsville, Alabama to Mumbai, Jaipur, the Aravalli hills, to a garden, a wilderness, a &quot;reflection pond,&quot; a kitchen, an artist&#39;s studio, and a pathology lab. Her book is lesson, a lexicon, a legend, story, journey, travelogue, a gift of laugher and exquisite joy. Dr. Soni&#39;s reflections are illuminations; they are moonlight and sunlight, science, and art and &quot;a trajectory of life,&quot; to borrow the title of her initial poem. To read her poetry is to truly &quot;step out in pure awe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Soni&#39;s kaleidoscope nourishes the creative spirit as the myriad reflections that bring to view family relationships-the love for a father who quotes the Bhagavad Gita, Arabic poetry, Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain, for a son who lives in Jaipur, a daughter who is described as a moon-maiden. The book is savory  &quot;parathas&quot; (griddle-flaky flat bread) and mangos. It is stories of sisters, the very &quot;keepers of each other&#39;s identity&quot;: it is bed tea, and &quot;butterscotch laughter.&quot;  My Light Reflections traces the soul&#39;s journey to that place within where the &quot;thousand petal lotus blooms.&quot; Dr. Soni reminds us as loving earthly beings  that &quot;our body is precious; it is our vehicle for awakening.&quot; A painter, poet, physician and philosopher, her words are prescriptions for how to live both fully and well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
