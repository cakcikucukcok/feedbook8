  <title>A Christian and a Storm Called Cancer - Darren M. Zych, Dr. Kunle Odunsi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who doesnt like a good storm? The sound of thunder in the distance or waves crashing against the rocks. Having been born and raised in Western New York all of my life, I have seen some of the most fierce winter storms on record. The Blizzard of 77 truly is the benchmark for those who lived through it. Along with that just mention the phrase Lake Effect joined with the unimaginable 4-6 inches of snow per hour it produces and you then get a good idea of what I mean. However the storm I was about to enter into had nothing to do with weather, but rather with my very existence itself! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Darrens testimony of Gods goodness in the midst of the Storm of Cancer is inspiring. Like me, I hope and pray that you are blessed by this book. Dr. Kunle Odunsi. Deputy Director Roswell Park Cancer Institute. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If your facing the Storm of Cancer, this book is a Must! Pastor Chuck Pezzino. Creekside Assembly of God. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In A Christian and a Storm Called Cancer, Gods Ultimate Perfect Will is Perpetuated and Revealed. A Must Read filled with Applicable Truth and Practical, Shareable Resources. Kevin Klenke , Owner Voipteck Solutions LLC &amp; Worship Leader Evangel Assembly of God. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Though this book has an emphasis on Cancer, I found it to be insightful, inspirational and helpful for any storm scenario one might be going through. John OKeefe, Worship Leader &amp; Songwriter for Creekside Assembly of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
