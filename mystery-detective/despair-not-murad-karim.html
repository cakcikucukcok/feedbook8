  <title>Despair Not - Murad Karim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mathew is a twenty-six-year-old lowlife and criminal in the Dublin inner city. He is an avid motorcyclist and member of a local gang run by his best friend, Kevin. Following a violent bike wreck, Mathew is taken to the hospital, where he is informed he has a soft tissue sarcoma, an aggressive cancer that attacks the muscle. Unable to tell his mother, he sends Kevin to break the news for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon Mathew is readmitted to the hospital for an operation to remove the tumour on his leg. Trapped in his hospital bed, Mathew soon makes the acquaintance of his roommate, whose daughter often comes to visit. Her name is Iris, and Mathew cant help but be drawn to the beautiful girl, although she does not return his feelings. Meanwhile, a nurse at the hospital, Caroline, develops feelings of her own for Mathew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outside, gang leader Kevin is shot and captured, leaving Mathew, feeling as though the hospital is a prison. He fears someone may soon arrive to kill him. As he fights cancer, he also fights his feelingsbut love cannot save him from murderous gangbangers. Will he live long enough to turn his life around?&lt;/p&gt;" />
