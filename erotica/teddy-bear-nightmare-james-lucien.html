  <title>Teddy Bear Nightmare - James Lucien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
A space scavenger gives his teenage daughter an old teddy bear as a nostalgic gift, which he found on a mysteriously abandoned freighter, unknowing of the malicious entity contained within. Teddy Bear Nightmare is a science-fiction horror erotica novella. An incestuous BDSM story of dubious consent and non-consensual sex.
EXCERPT
Unfastened grav-boots clapping the deck to announce my approaching arrival, I strut into the galley, wearing hot-pink thigh-high socks to exhibit my slender legs, cyan short-shorts that allow the bottoms of my firm cheeks to peek out, a white cropped sleeveless blouse to showcase my tight tummy and thin waist, with my baby-pink hair tied in pigtails with cyan bows.
The stunned look on my dad’s handsome face as his deep-blue eyes rove over my body is a priceless reward. He blinks at me in shock for a long moment, before clearing his throat. “Kayley, princess, what did I tell ya about dressing like that?”
Sitting down across from him, I huff, “Daddy, it’s my birthday, remember? You said when I turn eighteen I can wear whatever thrash I want.”
He groans, “Yes. That’ll teach me to make declarations in the heat of the moment.” He sighs with a self-deprecating shake of his head, then grins at me. “Happy birthday.”
I smile softly. “Thanks, Daddy.”
He gives me his serious face. “Now fasten those boots.”
I look away with a guilty grin. “Yes, Daddy.” And with a thought command, my grav-boots tighten around my ankles.
Rosa leans over the table to place a plate of hot food before me, her ginormous melons swaying haphazardly. “Happy eighteenth birthday, darling.” She speaks with an Old Earth French accent for my dad. He likes the sensual sound of it. It makes me wanna punch her in the throat.
I roll my strawberry-pink eyes dismissively at her. “Whatever, bot.”
Dad retrieves a gift-wrapped box from under the table. “I didn’t forget my princess’s birthday.”
I tear it open and discover a teddy bear, a simple stuffed animal with no electronics, just like the one I had as a child before I placed it in my mom’s coffin to keep her safe out in space. I’m instantly overcome with nostalgia.
Joyful tears splashing my cheeks, I race around the table and leap onto my dad’s lap into his open arms. “Thank ya, Daddy, thank ya!”
He kisses my crown, then thumbs away my tears. “You’re welcome, princess. I’m glad it had the desired effect. I wasn’t sure. To be honest, I got ya something else. The teddy I stumbled upon yesterday on that abandoned freighter.”
My dad’s a scavenger. He tracks down lost ships and commandeers their forgotten cargo. He and my mom used to venture into the wreckage of recent battlefields, which was much more profitable, until one day the damaged stellar drive of a neighboring ship went nova.
With a coy smile, I look at him out of the corner of my eye. “Sooo, there’s another gift somewhere?”
He chuckles. “Yes, but after today, you are not to use it until after your daily education assignments are complete.”
I clap my hands excitedly. “You finally had it repaired?!”
“Yes.” He flares his eyes, mimicking me. “Finally. Not only repaired but upgraded as well.”
I embrace him again, squeezing tight. “Thank ya so much!”
