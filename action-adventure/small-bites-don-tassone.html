  <title>Small Bites - Don Tassone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Small Bites,&lt;/em&gt; Don Tassone offers readers bits of contemporary life, mostly gentle, mostly optimistic, often instructive. Stories range from flash-fiction size half-pagers to twenty-page studies of how relationships develop, how decisions are made and unmade, how persuasion and collaboration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection is divided into fourteen tiny Appetizers, twelve substantial Entrees, and fourteen small but intense Desserts. Appetizers like &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Run&amp;quot; are quick and easy to consume; they&amp;#39;re secular parables, meant to produce a small, &amp;quot;got it!&amp;quot; sense of surprise as readers fill in what&amp;#39;s implied but not directly stated. Entrees range more widely, sometimes questioning current forms of connectivity, sometimes underscoring a sense that humans need to trust and to engage with one another. &amp;quot;The Discord in Our Souls,&amp;quot; for example, leaves readers puzzling over which of several bad options is least bad. &amp;quot;Beauty Mark&amp;quot; traces a model&amp;#39;s reaction to the accident which defaces her. &amp;quot;Everything Is Real&amp;quot; includes a ghost. Most stories in the final set, the Desserts, focus on beginnings and endings--on little acts of courage, sweet though painful memories, manageable ironies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Small Bites,&lt;/em&gt; Don Tassone combines insights gained during a successful thirty-year career in corporate public relations with those which come from growing up in a middle class American family, becoming a parent, watching people grow. He&amp;#39;s the author of the novel, &lt;em&gt;Drive, &lt;/em&gt;and another collection of stories titled &lt;em&gt;Get Back.&lt;/em&gt; He currently teaches courses at Xavier University, writes, and enjoys cooking up stories like these.&lt;/p&gt;" />
