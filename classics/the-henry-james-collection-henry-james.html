  <title>The Henry James Collection - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henry James&amp;nbsp;was an American-British author regarded as a key transitional figure between&amp;nbsp;literary realism&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;literary modernism, and is considered by many to be among the greatest novelists in the English language. He was the son of&amp;nbsp;Henry James Sr.&amp;nbsp;and the brother of renowned philosopher and psychologist&amp;nbsp;William James&amp;nbsp;and diarist&amp;nbsp;Alice James.&lt;br /&gt;
He is best known for a number of novels dealing with the social and marital interplay between emigre Americans, English people, and continental Europeans &amp;ndash; examples of such novels include&amp;nbsp;The Portrait of a Lady,&amp;nbsp;The Ambassadors, and&amp;nbsp;The Wings of the Dove. His later works were increasingly experimental. In describing the internal states of mind and social dynamics of his characters, James often made use of a style in which ambiguous or contradictory motives and impressions were overlaid or juxtaposed in the discussion of a character&amp;#39;s psyche. For their unique ambiguity, as well as for other aspects of their composition, his late works have been compared to&amp;nbsp;impressionist painting.&lt;br /&gt;
James also published articles and books of criticism,&amp;nbsp;travel, biography, autobiography and plays. Born in the United States, James largely relocated to Europe as a young man and eventually settled in England, becoming a&amp;nbsp;British subject&amp;nbsp;in 1915, one year before his death. James was nominated for the&amp;nbsp;Nobel Prize in Literature&amp;nbsp;in 1911, 1912 and 1916." />
