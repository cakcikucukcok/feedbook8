Common threads have always woven through the world&#39;s mythology and folklore, strings which seem to link cultures divided by the vastness of oceans and time. Have you ever wondered why? What if I told you that they all stem from a single origin.....the Varth-lokkr. Within this ancient creature&#39;s blood, stirs the power to save or enslave the world as we know it, a power ignited by a simple word. But which does it truly desire? This dark urban fantasy follows one of these creatures through its emergence into 21st century Australia. It chronicles the rise of those who oppose it, those who ally themselves with it and those who are unwillingly drawn into its wake." />
