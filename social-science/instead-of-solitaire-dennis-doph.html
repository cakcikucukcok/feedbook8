What is the reason for &quot;Instead of Solitaire&quot;?
TO MAKE YOU OLD POETRY DOGS SIT UP ON YOUR HAUNCHES AND BARK.
Why are Americans expected to mellow out when they past fifty?
BECAUSE IT IS TRADITION. BUT THEN WE ARE NOT ALL MARRIED TO LAURA BUSH.
Why are you determined to rattle everybodys cage?
WHY ARE YOU DETERMINED TO LIVE IN ONE?
