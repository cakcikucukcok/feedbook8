  <title>Bloodland - Alan Glynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Picador Paperback Original&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A helicopter crash off the coast of Ireland sends unexpected ripples through the international community in this intricate new thriller from the author of &lt;i&gt;Winterland&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Limitless &lt;/i&gt;(now a major motion picture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susie Monaghan was on the cusp of stardom when her life was cut short by a tragic helicopter crash. After a full investigation, her death was ruled an accident: case closed. But a hungry young journalist named Jimmy Gilroy isn&#39;t buying the official story. Before dying, Susie&#39;s path had crossed with an unlikely gallery of powerful men: an ex-Prime minister with a carefully guarded secret; the businessman brother of a U.S. Senator angling for the Oval Office; and a billionaire investor with his eye on an extremely rare commodity. Might there also be a link between Susie&#39;s death and a deranged security contractor operating in Congo? Piece by piece, Jimmy uncovers a bizarre nexus of coincidence among these disparate people and events, revealing a conspiracy of frightening reach and consequence--one that could cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against a vividly drawn world of corporate and political intrigue, Alan Glynn&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Bloodland&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting paranoid thriller of uncommon depth and page-turning suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />
