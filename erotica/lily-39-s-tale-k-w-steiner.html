  <title>Lily&#39;s Tale - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For decades Lily Porter lived as her late-mother&amp;rsquo;s surrogate, filling the void her death had left in her father&amp;rsquo;s life. Now, after taking care of her father&amp;rsquo;s sinful needs for much of her life, Lily has to come to grips with yet another family issue, as her daughter, now a beautiful young woman, begins to sparkle in Pastor Joshua Porter&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lily gasped at what she&amp;rsquo;d just heard. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, not until she leaned forward and peered through the inch-wide opening provided by the ajar door into her daughter&amp;rsquo;s bedroom. What she saw very nearly made her cry out, and she brought a hand up to her mouth to stifle it, biting down on her index finger to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inside, on Leilani&amp;rsquo;s bed, her daughter lay on her back, completely in the nude. Her arms were drawn up and lay across the pillows to either side of her head, with her long, nearly black hair splayed out in a halo. Her naked breasts, small mounds capped by darkened nipples the size of pencil erasers centered in nickel-sized discs, rose up and down on her toned, slender rib-cage. Her flat belly moved with her breathing, and further down, the tight, well-trimmed triangle of dark pubic hair pointed into the valley between her slightly splayed out legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the foot of the bed stood Lily&amp;rsquo;s father, who was still fully dressed in his denim blue jeans and a plaid flannel shirt, his attention fully on her nude daughter. Lily felt herself trembling as she stood transfixed in the hallway, witnessing what she did and unable to interrupt. In her mind she knew what was about to take place, and as much as she knew it to be wrong, so very wrong, she was unable to bring herself to put a halt to it even before it had begun. Instead, and unbelievably for her, she stood quiet, watching as her father and daughter engaged in the most sinful of acts, an act she herself had enjoyed for so many years." />
