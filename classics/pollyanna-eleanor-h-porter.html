Porter, considered a classic of children's literature. The book's success led to Porter soon writing a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (1915). Eleven more Pollyanna sequels, known as "Glad Books", were later published, most of them written by Elizabeth Borton or Harriet Lummis Smith.<br /><b><i>Pollyanna - Wikipedia</i></b> | Pollyanna is an interesting book. It was published only four years after Anne of Green Gables, and both stories have a similar storyline: a plucky, young girl of eleven or so is orphaned and has nowhere to go.Both Pollyanna and Anne struggle with their appearance and both are received in a lackluster way, by new caregivers who aren't sure they really want them.<br /><b><i>Pollyanna (Pollyanna, #1) by Eleanor H. Porter</i></b> | Pollyanna is a best-selling novel by Eleanor H. Porter that is now considered a classic of children's literature. The book was such a success that Porter soon produced a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (ISBN 9781439297513 ).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Pollyanna - Eleanor H.
