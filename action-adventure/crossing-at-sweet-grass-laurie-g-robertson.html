  <title>Crossing at Sweet Grass - Laurie G. Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kallie is a young pioneer woman traveling the rugged Oregon Trail when her life changes in an instant after an unsuccessful river passage at Sweet Grass. After their solitary wagon is attacked and her husband and brother-in-law massacred, she is swooped up by an Indian warrior who shouts an exultant war cry, drapes her across his horse, and races across the prairie with her as his captive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kallie must now rely on her inner-strength and stubbornness to survive within uncharted Indian territory. As the war party leads Kallie and her sister-in-law along the river, Kallies abductor, Brave Eagle, must reconcile his tumultuous emotions as his white captive quickly captures his heart. Shocked by her own intensity of desire toward her captor, Kallie surrenders to him without understanding exactly why. As Brave Eagle leads her to his village and into an uncertain future, Kallie becomes immersed in a world where danger and sickness lurk in the shadows and nothing is promised as her destiny rises up to meet her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical romance novel set in the early American frontier, a white woman discovers love and passion with her Indian captor on the Oregon Trail as fate leads her into a future she never could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
