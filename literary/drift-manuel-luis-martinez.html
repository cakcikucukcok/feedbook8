His father, a Latin jazz musician, has left San Antonio for life on the road as a cool-hand playboy. His mother, shattered by a complete emotional and psychological breakdown, has moved to Los Angeles and taken Robert&#39;s little brother with her. Only his iron-willed grandmother, worn down by years of hard work, is left. But Robert&#39;s got a plan: Duck trouble, save his money, and head to California to put the family back together. Trouble is, no one believes a delinquent Mexican American kid has a chance--least of all, Robert himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrenching and wise, &lt;i&gt;Drift&lt;/i&gt; by Manuel Luis Martinez gives an unflinching vision of the menace of adolescence, the hard edge of physical labor, and the debts we owe to family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
