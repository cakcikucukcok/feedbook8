  <title>Twilight in Italy - D. H. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="D. H. Lawrence, in full David Herbert Lawrence (1885-1930), was an English author of novels, poems, plays, short stories, essays and travel books. He is valued by many as a visionary thinker and significant representative of modernism, as well as one of the finest writers in English literature. His novels &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1913), &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915), and &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1920) made him one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century. Much is said of Lawrence&#39;s fiction, but many have forgotten about his remarkable travel writing. &quot;Twilight in Italy&quot; is a small book of travel essays, worth reading for the light they throw on the context of Lawrence&#39;s work. The novel takes us on a foot tour of the Alps all the way down into the Verdant Gardens and the sun-soaked plazas of Italy. Lawrence gives us small stories here and there that not only share a sense of place, but also relate the experience of a real traveler." />
