  <title>Escape over the Iron Curtain - Cristina Rosi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;ESCAPE OVER THE IRON CURTAIN is a work of fiction, based on the true story of a young girls escape from former Socialist Romania. In search for a true identity and spirituality she ends up in New York City, where she has plenty of freedom to create her own reality and to follow her dreams. Bound by the invisible chains of poverty Anna encounters unexpected situations and learns many difficult and sometimes uplifting lessons.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Glimpses in the life of a misguided teenager in former Socialist Romania, and her brave escape into a new life facing unexpected and puzzling situations. They sat me next to one of the officers. I had no idea where they were taking me. We drove for about an hour. It was so dark that I couldnt see anything except for the road in front of us illuminated by the headlights. We were in a mountainous terrain and the Jeep was taking many turns. As I was getting used to the darkness I could distinguish silhouettes of trees by the side of the road, black phantoms rushing into the night. The Jeep stopped by a brick wall with barbed wire on top. A large gate opened and we drove in&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; In search for an identity and plagued by poverty she joins a spiritual community hoping to fulfill the void in her life, only to find herself immersed in a web of emotional drama.&lt;/P&gt;" />
