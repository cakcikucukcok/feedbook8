  <title>Solving Partial Differential Equation Applications with PDE2D - Granville Sewell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solve engineering and scientific partial differential equation applications using the PDE2D software developed by the author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solving Partial Differential Equation Applications with PDE2D&lt;/i&gt; derives and solves a range of ordinary and partial differential equation (PDE) applications. This book describes an easy-to-use, general purpose, and time-tested PDE solver developed by the author that can be applied to a wide variety of science and engineering problems.  The equations studied include many time-dependent, steady-state and eigenvalue applications such as diffusion, heat conduction and convection, image processing, math finance, fluid flow, and elasticity and quantum mechanics, in one, two, and three space dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author begins with some simple &quot;0D&quot; problems that give the reader an opportunity to become familiar with PDE2D before proceeding to more difficult problems. The book ends with the solution of a very difficult nonlinear problem, which requires a moving adaptive grid because the solution has sharp, moving peaks. This important book:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Describes a finite-element program, PDE2D, developed by the author over the course of 40 years&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Derives the ordinary and partial differential equations, with appropriate initial and boundary conditions, for a wide variety of applications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Offers free access to the Windows version of the PDE2D software through the author’s website at www.pde2d.com&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Offers free access to the Linux and MacOSX versions of the PDE2D software also, for instructors who adopt the book for their course and contact the author at www.pde2d.com&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written for graduate applied mathematics or computational science classes, &lt;i&gt;Solving Partial Differential Equation Applications with PDE2D &lt;/i&gt;offers students the opportunity to actually solve interesting engineering and scientific applications using the accessible PDE2D.&lt;/p&gt;" />
