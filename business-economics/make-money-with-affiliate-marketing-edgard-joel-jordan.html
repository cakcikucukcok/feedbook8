  <title>Make Money with Affiliate Marketing - Edgard Joel Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover How You Too Can Make Money With Affiliate Marketing!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Affiliate marketing has always been one of the most popular methods of making money. For anyone who is just starting out, there&amp;rsquo;s no easier or faster method of generating income. For anyone who already operates their own online business, selling other people&amp;rsquo;s products can create a substantial boost to the income they&amp;rsquo;re already receiving.&lt;br /&gt;
The primary appeal comes from the fact that the only task the affiliate has to perform is promote whatever product or service they believe has substantial sales potential. The owner of the product or service does everything else.&lt;br /&gt;
In theory, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need a website in order to make money as an affiliate. You can simply promote your assigned affiliate link and then send prospective buyers to the owner&amp;rsquo;s sales page. Of course, the obvious drawback is that almost every other affiliate will be doing the exact same&amp;nbsp;thing. If all you&amp;rsquo;re doing is directing targeted traffic through your affiliate sales link, you&amp;rsquo;ll be competing on an equal level with countless other people who are promoting the same product.&lt;br /&gt;
The only way to break out of the pack is to market and promote the affiliate product in a more intelligent and aggressive manner. Those who are referred to as &amp;ldquo;super&amp;rdquo; affiliates, make a great deal of money selling other people&amp;rsquo;s products. That&amp;rsquo;s because they market and promote them in the same way they would their own products.&lt;br /&gt;
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s a sales page associated with each of the affiliate products, they create a page on their own website. The purpose of that page is to pre-sell the item. In other words, they get the prospect primed and ready to purchase prior to sending them to the owner&amp;rsquo;s sales site.&lt;br /&gt;
They also use pay per click advertising to gain targeted prospects. They know that in order to make money, they have to spend money. Of course, most of them have become masters of pay per click. They know exactly what works, exactly how much to bid, and exactly how to attract the right prospects. And because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to play the game so well, they most often generate a great deal more money than if they had simply used free advertising methods." />
