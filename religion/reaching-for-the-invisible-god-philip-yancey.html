  <title>Reaching for the Invisible God - Philip Yancey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How does a relationship with God really work?  How do I relate to a God who is invisible, when I’m never quite sure he’s there?  How do I know him?  How do I communicate with him?  How do I live my life growing in my understanding of him, living more and more with a conscious awareness of him, doing more of those things he indicates are good for me--and others?Many have found the bright promises people make about God don&#39;t work.  Others have seen God&#39;s promises work, but have stumbled, and want to believe again.  Author Philip Yancey pointed out in Disappointment with God some of the false expectations people have in God and his workings.  It&#39;s time now to turn the coin.  In Reaching for the Invisible God Yancey answers the question What Can We Expect from God? with a surprising investigation of how the Christian life really does work.The average person often finds that what they hear in a sermon or read in a Bible corresponds to little of what they experience.  Why?  When others do experience great things from God, those who sense &quot;business as usual&quot; in their spiritual life ask, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot;  God doesn&#39;t do certain things he could--heal, mend, or change--but what does he do?  How does God work, and how does he work with me?In taking on these questions Yancey continues his quest to help readers get close to the core of Christian truth and experience.  Reaching for the Invisible God develops what we can expect from God by taking readers to six foundational areas:  the thirst or hunger for God, God himself, the Spirit, faith, growth, and personal transformation in the spiritual life. Reaching for the Invisible God also explores the personality of God, the choice God made in limiting himself, and the great condescension he made as the Holy Spirit, choosing to live in human beings. Finally, Reaching for the Invisible God comes to an appropriate finish as Yancey writes about growth, about childlike living under God apart from unrealistic expectations, legalisms, and unhealthy dependence.  The goal is mature childlikeness, with no preconceptions, an ability to accept gifts from God, and trust, which lead to the responses of love, sacrifice, the denial of self, and servant leadership.In Reaching for the Invisible God Philip Yancey writes with honesty about the Christian life, about how to get along with God, how to believe again, and about the Reaching for the Invisible God of faith, or the things people never told you about the Christian life.  It&#39;s the real scoop and straight talk about the truth--like an operating manual for faith.  It is for the reader seeking to be honest with God.  And it will help anyone wanting to explain to friends what life as a Christian is all about." />
