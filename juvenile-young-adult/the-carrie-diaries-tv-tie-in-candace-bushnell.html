      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Meet Carrie Bradshaw before ‘Sex and the City!’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Carrie Diaries is the coming-of-age story of one of the most iconic characters of our generation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw was a small town girl who knew she wanted more. She&#39;s ready for real life to start, but first she must navigate her senior year of high school. Up until now, Carrie and her friends have been inseparable. Then Sebastian Kydd comes into the picture, and a friend&#39;s betrayal makes her question everything.&lt;br /&gt;With an unforgettable cast of characters, The Carrie Diaries is the story of how a regular girl learns to think for herself, and evolves into a sharp, insightful writer. Readers will learn about her family background, how she found her writing voice, and the indelible impression her early friendships and relationships left on her. Through adventures both audacious and poignant, we&#39;ll see what brings Carrie to her beloved New York City, where her new life begins.&lt;/p&gt;
