  <title>An Excellent Wife? (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Charlotte Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Wanted: a wife of convenience James had never been in love. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He intended to marry a woman who didn&#39;t make demands, or who would change his life… . So why did he find Patience Kirby so attractive? She certainly wasn&#39;t his idea of marriage material! For one thing, she was a sparky redhead, while he&#39;d always preferred cool blondes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For another, he was used to a peaceful, elegant life-style, and Patience&#39;s home was full of kids, old people and animals; noise, warmth and caring… . But in order to have her in his bed, did James have to make Patience his wife?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;MAN Talk There are two sides to every story - now it&#39;s his turn!&lt;/em&gt;
