  <title>THE BOOK OF SWEDISH FAIRY TALES - 28 children&#39;s stories from Sweden - Anon E. Mouse, Edited and Retold by Clara Stroebe, Illustrated by George W. Hood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume of 28 Swedish fairy-tales represents a careful choice of the best examples of Swedish lore and tales. Infused with the Swedish culture, they are the most colorful and entertaining tales to be found, for the fairy-tales of Scandinavia, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, have a distinct local color of their own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find 28 children&amp;rsquo;s stories like the delightful &amp;quot;Lasse, My Thrall&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Princess and the Glass Mountain.&amp;quot; Of course there are stories of princesses being rescued from ogres and giants like in the story of &amp;ldquo;Silverwhite And Lillwacker.&amp;rdquo; There are also stories of the low-born lad who makes good and becomes a king, like that of &amp;ldquo;The Mount Of The Golden Queen.&amp;rdquo; But you can&amp;rsquo;t have a book of tales from the far Northern realms without a story about&amp;nbsp; a &amp;ldquo;giant, troll and werewolf&amp;rdquo;, for this is also the land of Beowulf the Vikings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We could carry on waxing lyrical for a lot longer but will leave the discovery of these wonderfully, magical tales to you and your kin. As such, you are invited to download and read this enchanting volumes of Swedish folk and fairy lore.&lt;br /&gt;
