  <title>Security - Stephen Amidon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There isn&#39;t much crime in Stoneleigh, Massachusetts. It&#39;s a college town, a mountain getaway for the quietly rich,&lt;br&gt;where the average burglar alarm is set off by foraging wildlife. So when Edward Inman, the owner of Stoneleigh Sentinel, gets a latenight false alarm from the home of Doyle Cutler, one of his wealthiest clients, Edward thinks nothing of it--not until a local student, Mary Steckl, claims that she was sexually assaulted at Cutler&#39;s house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward soon finds himself drawn to Mary&#39;s story, even though the rest of the town doubts her, including his wife, a rising politician who has made security the platform of her mayoral campaign. While homework from a creative writing class is leaked as evidence of a dark secret between Mary and her father, Edward&#39;s investigations lead him to his old girlfriend, Kathryn Williams, whose teenage son may hold the key to the truth about that night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Human Capital&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Security&lt;/i&gt; is a timely, wry, and riveting story of adults and children, secret lives and civic&lt;br&gt;culture, suspicion and sexual hysteria. It confirms Stephen Amidon as a master of the art and one of the foremost chroniclers of American life today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
