  <title>Juz Amma From Holy Quran For Kids - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Juz Amma from The Noble Quran with english and arabic languange for children.The Quran Holy literally meaning &amp;quot;the recitation&amp;quot;; also romanized Qur&amp;#39;an or Koran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from Allah SWT (God) It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (surah in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (ayah).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Prophet Muhammad SAW was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Prophet Muhammad SAW, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Prophet Adam (Pbuh) and ended with Prophet Muhammad SAW." />
