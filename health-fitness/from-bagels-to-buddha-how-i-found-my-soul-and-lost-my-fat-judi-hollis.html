  <title>From Bagels to Buddha: How I Found My Soul and Lost My Fat - Judi Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity affects over 33 percent of Americans-that&#39;s one third of adults. Medical costs associated with obesity are estimated at $147 billion and obese adults are at a higher risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, liver and Gallbladder disease, and respiratory problems.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;From Bagels to Buddha&lt;/I&gt;, a successful therapist, renowned for her work with addictive and obese families, uses her own story to illustrate her message that a spiritual life is the key to sustaining weight loss and ending food obsessions.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Dr. Hollis tells us that the path to permanent weight loss has little to do with what you are eating or what&#39;s eating you, but rather involves changing how you behave, how you interact with others, how you face your own dark side, and ultimately how you accept life on life&#39;s terms. Only then will you start eating to nurture your true inner being and only then will enough ever be enough.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Written in an unexpectedly witty and self-deprecating style, Dr. Hollis recounts some humbling learning experiences, such as her nerve-racking first appearance on &lt;I&gt;Oprah&lt;/I&gt; that caused her to vow never to do TV again, and an uncomfortable stay at a Buddhist Monastery, where she had finagled her way into the last week of a three-week meditation workshop. Her story entertains with many more comical moments, even as it tackles a serious, sometimes life-or-death, subject.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;" />
