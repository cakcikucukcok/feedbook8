  <title>Flirting After Fifty - Barbara L. Bellman, Susan Goldstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do some women always have a man in their lives, and others never do? We owe a debt of gratitude to those women who are successful in dating, in flirting, in meeting great guys. They have shown us the way.&lt;p&gt; 
The older we get, the more set we are that things should be done a certain way. We like things the way we like things   safe, expected, comfortable. So what happens when we need to shake up the status quo and grow?&lt;P&gt;
Meeting new people gets harder as we age. But it doesn&#39;t have to be a barrier to happiness. We just have to navigate around the obstacles to find our way.&lt;P&gt; 
Flirting is   an opening, a signal, an overture. It says, &quot;I&#39;m interested in you.&quot; It&#39;s not a commitment. It&#39;s not forever after. It&#39;s a peek and a wink. It&#39;s the opening credits and if you and he like what unfolds, you may stick around and watch the whole story.&lt;P&gt;  
What happens next is up to you. &lt;P&gt;
Why not go for it? &lt;P&gt;
You&#39;ve got nothing to lose but your heart!" />
