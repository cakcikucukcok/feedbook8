  <title>The Rule of Three - Eric Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One shocking afternoon, computers around the globe shut down in a viral catastrophe. At sixteen-year-old Adam Daley&#39;s high school, the problem first seems to be a typical electrical outage, until students discover that cell phones are down, municipal utilities are failing, and a few computer-free cars like Adam&#39;s are the only vehicles that function. Driving home, Adam encounters a storm tide of anger and fear as the region becomes paralyzed. Soon--as resources dwindle, crises mount, and chaos descends--he will see his suburban neighborhood band together for protection. And Adam will understand that having a police captain for a mother and a retired government spy living next door are not just the facts of his life but the keys to his survival, in &lt;i&gt;The Rule of Three &lt;/i&gt;by Eric Walters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
