  <title>Water Earth Fire Air - Edward V. Van Slambrouck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Carolyn Walkers Forward to WATER EARTH FIRE AIR:&lt;br&gt;
Ed Van Slambroucks book of poetry, WATER EARTH FIRE AIR, is one mans wise, sentimental, and sometimes playful meditation on Gods love and the experience of His creation. Earnest as a childs devotional, heartfelt as a fathers prayer, and occasionally touched with a tongue-in-cheek pun, Van Slambroucks poetry collection, his fourth in an ambitious series fueled by a prolific writing schedule, explores Gods bounty as he lived it in eight decades of life.&lt;br&gt;
Using the language of imagery and style (informed by Van Slambroucks gift for music) the collection takes the reader by the spirit and coaxes him through such diverse experiences as what it means to adore a woman, raise children, conquer illness, appreciate a friend, play the saxophone, feel the wind and worship at the foot of the Cross.&lt;br&gt; 
Acclimations about E. V. Van Slambroucks other books:&lt;br&gt;
Opus in Chromatic Words (2010): Eds ever-present saxophone permeates a life celebrated in word-images, framed with music and poetry. James F. Ahearn, Poet and President of the Poetry Society of Michigan. &lt;br&gt;
Heart Music (2008): Poetry is the perfect form for his thoughts because it combines sound and image in a way that is as close to song as one can get, while still using language. Margo LaGattuta, Poet and Teacher.&lt;br&gt;
OnSpring: A Family of Poems (2005): thanks for sending me your touching chapbook, OnSpring, whose pages are heartfelt, moving, linguistically admirable and playful. Peter Meinke, Poet and Professor." />
