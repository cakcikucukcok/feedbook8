  <title>Just Desserts (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Too Many Cooks?, Book 3) - Jeannie Watt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Always proper Layla Taylor never expected to need her childhood nemesis. But when she&#39;s stranded in a blizzard after breaking up with her cheating ex, Justin Tremont is exactly what she&#39;s missing. Well, Justin and his car&#39;s snow tires.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Justin&#39;s more than okay being the rebound guy. A little fun, no strings–that&#39;s his kind of relationship. But Layla Taylor? She&#39;s by the book, to put it mildly. Justin, on the other hand, hardly ever follows his own recipes for the spectacular cakes he&#39;s become known for. This woman is making him feel protective and possessive, of all things. And she sees right through him. That he can&#39;t have. After all, no chef likes to tell all his secrets….&lt;/p&gt;
