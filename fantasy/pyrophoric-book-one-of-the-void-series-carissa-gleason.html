  <title>Pyrophoric: Book One of the Void Series - Carissa Gleason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fire burns, destroys the land. Air caresses where sky meets sand. Water washes away our sin. Earth lies strong, our nation&amp;#39;s skin. But deep in the shadows, a power creeps. The Void it is called, and many secrets it keeps. &amp;nbsp;The Elementals have ruled over the land of Daevarith for all of the kingdom&amp;#39;s recorded history. The Fire Elementals hold strong to the top of the social hierarchy, followed by their counterparts, the Water Elementals, then the Earth, and finally Air. Those deemed powerless by Placement, a team funded by the Daevarithian government to place each person in their proper class, fall to the very bottom of the chain and are called Blanks. &amp;nbsp;Fourteen-year-old Arcana Mason, a Firehead as they are not so endearingly called, was born to two of the highest regarded Fire Elementals in all of the land and has lived a life of luxury. The best food, the best clothing, the best education&amp;mdash;only the finest things in life, and they&amp;#39;re simply handed to her on a shiny silver platter. Yet when she and her private tutor, an Earth Elemental by the name of Gilligan Troye, make a discovery while analyzing an old Blanks records from Placement itself, privileged Arcana will stop at nothing to discover the meaning behind their findings, even if that makes her a target for those dedicated to keeping the secret hidden. &amp;nbsp;What if the whispers are all true? What if the old folk legends aren&amp;#39;t as fantastical as they might have seemed? A power much greater than even that of the Fire users may be lurking in the shadows of the impoverished, the powerless, and Arcana is determined to find it, regardless of the costs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
