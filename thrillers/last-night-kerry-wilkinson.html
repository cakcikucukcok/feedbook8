  <title>Last Night - Kerry Wilkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Rose Denton wakes up in her car. She has no memory of how she got there. But she knows something bad happened&amp;#x2026;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;#x2019;s blood on the windscreen and bonnet &amp;#x2013; but it&amp;#x2019;s not hers and there&amp;#x2019;s no sign of anything or anyone she might have hit. The last thing she remembers is being in a hotel on a business trip but now she&amp;#x2019;s miles away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back home and her daughter&amp;#x2019;s boyfriend is missing. The last thing he did was argue with Rose over money. He left no note, no text, no clue as to his whereabouts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police have questions &amp;#x2013; and so does Rose&amp;#x2019;s family. But those are little compared to the ones she has for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened last night? And, perhaps more importantly, does she really want to know the answer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A totally addictive psychological thriller which will keep you turning the pages until the final dramatic twist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;Last Night&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Wow this had me captivated!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; &lt;b&gt;The book went by in a flash and OMG that ending! &lt;/b&gt;A really really good book that I thoroughly enjoyed.
