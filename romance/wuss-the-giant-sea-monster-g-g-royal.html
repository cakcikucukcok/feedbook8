  <title>Wuss, the Giant Sea Monster - G G Royal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of Wuss, the Giant Sea Monster is unlike any other. It is a tragic love story that highlights the less talked-about problem of binge drinking and the destruction it can cause in a relationship, plus it has a true sea . . . monster!
Brad Reno is in love. The woman he is in love with, Candy Cotton, is a binge drinker. This creates many problems for Brad. She does not see it as a problem and is unwilling to discuss it. Brad soon realizes this is the woman your mother should have warned you about.
During an overnight trip on their new boat, as he is planning in his mind how to confront Candy face-to-face to deal with this issue, they are attacked by a sea monster unlike anything that has ever been seen in the Gulf of Mexico. Wuss is the largest of God&#39;s most frightening creations. No one would ever try to take this monster alone . . . unless one has no choice.
