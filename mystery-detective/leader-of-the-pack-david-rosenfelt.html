  <title>Leader of the Pack - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over the course of his legal career, Andy Carpenter has lost a few cases. But that doesn&#39;t mean he forgets his clients. Andy has always been convinced that Joey Desimone, a man convicted of murder nine years ago, was innocent and believes that Joey&#39;s family&#39;s connections to organized crime played a pivotal role in his conviction. While there isn&#39;t much Andy can do for him while he serves out his prison sentence, Joey suggests that he check up on Joey&#39;s elderly uncle. He&#39;d rather not, but as a favor to Joey, Andy agrees to take his dog, Tara, on a few visits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The old man&#39;s memory is going, but when Andy tries to explain why he&#39;s there, it jogs something in the man&#39;s mind, and his comments leave Andy wondering if Uncle Nick is confused, or if he just might hold the key to Joey&#39;s freedom after all this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andy grabs on to this thread of possibility and follows it into a world where the oath of silence is stronger than blood ties, and where people will do anything to make sure their secrets are kept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riveting, suspenseful, and highly entertaining, &lt;i&gt;Leader of the Pack&lt;/i&gt; is bestseller David Rosenfelt&#39;s latest entry in his much-beloved Andy Carpenter series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
