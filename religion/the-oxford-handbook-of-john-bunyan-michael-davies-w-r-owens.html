  <title>The Oxford Handbook of John Bunyan - Michael Davies, W. R. Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Oxford Handbook of John Bunyan is the most extensive volume of original essays ever published on the seventeenth-century Nonconformist preacher and writer, John Bunyan. Its thirty-eight chapters examine Bunyan&#39;s life and works, their religious and historical contexts, and the critical reception of his writings, in particular his allegorical narrative, The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress. Interdisciplinary and comprehensive, it provides unparalleled scope and
expertise, ranging from literary theory to religious history and from theology to post-colonial criticism.
The Handbook is structured in four sections. The first, &#39;Contexts&#39;, deals with the historical Bunyan in relation to various aspects of his life, background, and work as a Nonconformist: from basic facts of biography to the nature of his church at Bedford, his theology, and the religious and political cultures of seventeenth-century Dissent. Part 2 considers Bunyan&#39;s literary output: from his earliest printed tracts to his posthumously published works. Offering discrete chapters on
Bunyan&#39;s major works—Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, Parts I and II (1678; 1684); The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), and The Holy War (1682)—this section nevertheless covers Bunyan&#39;s oeuvre in its entirety: controversial and pastoral, narrative and poetic. Section
3, &#39;Directions in Criticism&#39;, engages with Bunyan in literary critical terms, focusing on his employment of form and language and on theoretical approaches to his writings: from psychoanalytic to post-secular criticism. Section 4, &#39;Journeys&#39;, tackles some of the ways in which Bunyan&#39;s works, and especially The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, have travelled throughout the world since the late seventeenth century, assessing Bunyan&#39;s place within key literary periods and their distinctive
developments: from the eighteenth-century novel to the writing of &#39;empire.&#39;" />
