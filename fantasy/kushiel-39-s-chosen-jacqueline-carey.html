  <title>Kushiel&#39;s Chosen - Jacqueline Carey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following hard on the heels of Kushiel&#39;s Dart, Jacqueline Carey&#39;s  spectacular debut novel, comes Kushiel&#39;s Chosen, a glittering and  riveting historical fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The land of Terre d&#39;Ange is a place  of unsurpassed beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the  land and saw it was good, and the ensuing race that rose from the seed  of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phèdre  nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her  left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond was  purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special  mission--and the first to recognize her for who and what she is: one  pricked by Kushiel&#39;s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and  pleasure as one.&lt;br&gt;Phèdre has trained in the courtly arts and the  talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, the ability to observe,  remember, and analyze. Having stumbled upon a plot that threatened the  very foundations of her homeland, she gave up almost everything she held  dear to save it. She survived, and lived to have others tell her story,  and if they embellished the tale with fabric of mythical splendor, they  weren&#39;t far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hands of the gods weigh heavily  upon Phèdre&#39;s brow, and they are not yet done with their charge--for  while the young queen who sits upon the throne is well loved by the  people, there are those who believe that other heads should wear the  crown. And those who escaped the wrath of the mighty are not yet done  with their schemes for power and revenge. To protect and serve, Phèdre  will once again leave her beloved homeland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the  sun-drenched villas of La Serenissima to the wilds of old Hellas, from a  prison designed to drive the very gods mad to an island of immutable  joy. Phèdre will meet old friends and new enemies and discover a plot so  dreadful as to make the earth tremble, masterminded by the one person  she cannot turn away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
