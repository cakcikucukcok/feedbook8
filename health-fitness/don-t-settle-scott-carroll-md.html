  <title>Don’T Settle - Scott Carroll Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you want to know the real secret to a satisfying and successful marriage? 
Gettingand stayinghappily married is probably one of the hardest things most of us will ever attempt. In fact, marriage is so challenging that you have to marry well to start with to even have a chance of success. Even worse, the advice youve heard all your life is either wrong or at best incomplete. 
Heartbroken after his second divorce, Dr. Carroll was determined to solve the puzzle of how to have a successful marriage. Drawing on his professional expertise as a psychiatrist and a wealth of field research, he emerged with a powerful yet simple system for finding your perfect match. Using neuroscience, genetics, behavioral science, psychology, and his work with shamans and other spiritual healers, he will teach you how to marry science with spirituality to attract the perfect man for you - the man you were meant for - and how to get him to the altar in as little as a year. 
Youll learn: 
	why the usual advice doesnt work 
	why amazing chemistry is a bad sign 
	what type of man is perfectly suited for you 
	how to energetically attract him 
	how to know hes really the one 
	and of course, how to get him to the altar! 
If youre tired of the singles scene and frustrated by failed attempts at love, Dont Settle is the step-by-step, complete solution youve been looking for." />
