With a foreword by Steve Blank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspiring entrepreneurs are told that to launch a business, you must go all in, devoting every resource and moment to making it work. But following this advice comes at an enormous personal cost: divorce, addiction, even suicide. It means sacrificing the intangibles that make life worth living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheryl O&amp;#8217;Loughlin knows there is a better way. In &lt;em&gt;Killing It,&lt;/em&gt; she shares the wisdom she&amp;#8217;s gained from her successful experiences launching a company from the ground up (Plum), running two fast-growing companies (Clif Bar and REBBL), and mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs (Stanford University).
