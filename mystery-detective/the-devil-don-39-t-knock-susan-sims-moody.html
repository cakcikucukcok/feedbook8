  <title>The Devil Don&#39;t Knock - Susan Sims Moody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A New South tale with the shadows of the Old South not far in the background. &lt;i&gt;The Devil Dont Knock&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting story of intrigue and greed that catapults everyday folk to the center of the stage. It is a story that will keep you on the edge of your chair or awake in your bed, depending on where you do your reading. Once picked up, its hard to put down.&lt;br&gt; 
Luke Boyd, author of &lt;i&gt;Coon Dogs and Outhouses, Tall Tales from the Mississippi Delta&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; An entertaining read. Susan Sims Moody knows how to spin a good yarn.
&lt;br&gt; Jim Fraiser, author of &lt;i&gt;Shadow Seed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mississippi River Country Tales&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;SOUTHERN GIRL  Jennifer Martin, plucky and independent, returns to Bedford, Mississippi, in the third installment of the mystery series that bears her name. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Usually bold and resilient, the never-say-die Jennifer is plagued by fear and gruesome nightmares. Tommy Capelli, indicted for murder almost a year ago, is scheduled for trial in just five days, and Jennifer is the states star witness. Trying to retain her sanity, she throws herself into her work at &lt;i&gt;The Bedford Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;, spending more time at the office than in her new apartment with roommate Magnolia Roan. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sleep-deprived and exhausted, Jennifer gets an eye-opening phone call from love interest Davis Sanford. Hes in trouble again, and this time its more serious than ever. Throw in an early-morning fire that turns Jennifers world upside down, and when she hears that Capelli has escaped, she must decide if she will run and hide or seek the man she is slated to testify against. Can this homegrown, Mississippi girl dig deep into her Southern roots and use her resources to find the courage she needs? &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Susan Sims Moodys &lt;i&gt;The Devil Dont Knock&lt;/i&gt; spins a New South tale of greed and deception with Old South charm of small-town Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;" />
