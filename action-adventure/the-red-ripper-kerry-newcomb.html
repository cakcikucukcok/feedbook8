  <title>The Red Ripper - Kerry Newcomb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To his friends he was Big Foot Wallace and the Wild West Wind.  To his enemies he was El Destripedor Rojo, The Red Ripper.  Here is the extraordinary story of William Wallace, legendary frontiersman and a direct descendant of William The Braveheart, as portrayed in Mel Gibson&#39;s Academy Award-winning movie.  An epic adventure of heroism, savagery, and revenge, &lt;i&gt;The Red Ripper&lt;/i&gt; is classic historical novel, sure to be read and re-read for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Orleans, September 1829.  Brothers William and Samuel Wallace board a ship for Mexico with bold visions of wealth and adventure in a new land.  But a fool for a captain and a vicious storm land the two on the shores of Mexico, clinging for dear life.  And soon a brutal band of freebooters attack the brothers, murdering Samuel in front of William&#39;s very eyes.  From this day on, William&#39;s life has irrevocably changed course-his every waking moment is devoted to exacting bloody revenge upon his brother&#39;s killers.  This haunting quest will take Wallace from the sun-baked streets of Vera Cruz to the mist-laden bayous of Texas, where his sharp steel blades and burning hatred will earn him the name that strikes fear in the hearts of his enemies...The Red Ripper.&lt;/p&gt;" />
