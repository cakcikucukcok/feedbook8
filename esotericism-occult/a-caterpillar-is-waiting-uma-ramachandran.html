      <meta name="description" content="Indian culture commands great respect all over the world. Foreigners are very eager to learn about this culturewhy?
Indian culture is based on spirituality. Spirituality is based on science. Science is based on truth. The knowledge of science exists in the ether as vibrations of truth. This book explains about Indian culture and the Indian way of living, which is beneficial to the body, mind, and spirit.
A brilliant future awaits the readers of this book. In certain ways, all of us are unique. After reading this book, we will see that our life is transformed almost magically. Whenever we meet with crisis, we will not lament saying, Why is this my fate?
Many of us are uncertain whether God exists or not. This book removes all these doubts interestingly and clearly makes use of scientific truths.
Finally we have a book that paves the way for all the people of all countries to come closer. Geographical barriers have been broken. Our hearts are the beads, and divine love is the thread that will hold us together in a garland of unity. Yes. We are one!
This book should not only be read but chewed and digested." />
