  <title>In the Labyrinth of Grief: 40 Words of God that Offer Comfort - Jos Douma, Dick Moes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Labyrinth of Grief 40 Words of God that Offer Comfort  Brief meditations for those in sorrow  When death enters our life, a process begins that we refer to as grieving. This is a confusing process that is accompanied by different emotions such as sadness, unbelief, relief, anger, resignation, depression, despair, and even new joy in life.  The image of the labyrinth helps us to accept that grieving is a complex process in which we learn to accept the empty place and seek to come to grips with all our emotions.   The forty short meditations in this book were written with the goal that we might allow ourselves to be comforted from God&#39;s Word and that-in all our confusing emotions-we may know ourselves to be secure in the God who gives us hope." />
