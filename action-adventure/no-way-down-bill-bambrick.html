  <title>No Way Down - Bill Bambrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the ultimate airliner thriller. Skeptical? Consider this: After losing two of its three engines, a jumbo jet attempts a forced landing in a severe storm. One passenger dies, but the crew and the rest of the passengers survive. There&#39;s jut one hitch: the place they chose for a landing is the snow-covered summit of a 14,000-foot mountain. They&#39;re in extreme peril of dying of exposure and lack of oxygen, and are perched over the edge of an abyss. A mountain climbing team, also stranded in the storm, makes it up to render assistance, but they, too, are stuck up there with no food, no medical supplies, and worst of all, &lt;i&gt;NO WAY DOWN.&lt;/i&gt; Janet Gordon, sister of the downed aircraft&#39;s pilot, and chief operations officer of the airline, has to deal with a blackmail threat, vicious media attacks, and the airline&#39;s imminent bankruptcy, while trying to get help up to her brother and his doomed passengers. You may want to tape all your fingernails before reading this page-turner. Not for the faint-hearted!" />
