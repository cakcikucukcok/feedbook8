  <title>The Long-awaited Return to THOUGHTLAND! - Philip Eyam-Ozung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CHRISTIAN THOUGHT is the subject of this book and its unique approach is to hinge the pursuit of God on a defining journey of thought. Expectedly, the journey of thought is both thought-driven and designed to lead to an all-important Place of Thought that is its intended destination! The three milestones of the journey of thought that point to the philosophical and spiritual thrust of this book include the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.The Milestone of the Mystical Man. This first milestone points to the idea that man is a mystical creation whose life straddles both the human and divine dimensions of existence&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.The Milestone of the Thinking Man. This second milestone points to the idea that the key to unlocking and understanding man&amp;#39;s mystery-rich life is to recognize thought as the profoundly spiritual and sacred activity that enables him to live creatively to the extent of recording epochs of phenomenal creativity and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.The Milestone of the Divinely-connected Man. This third milestone points to the idea that the centrality of thought in both divinity and humanity is the most compelling evidence that man is neither self-existent nor unrelated to a thinking Creator!  &lt;br&gt;At the core of this book is the argument that the tendency to question or reject the Biblical account of man&amp;#39;s creation by God is directly attributable to the failure to recognize God&amp;#39;s existence and operation as a thinking Creator whose divine mind, mode of thinking and thoughts can be easily identified and authenticated! It is the failure to recognize God&amp;#39;s existence and operation as a thinking Creator that is directly responsible for the emergence of a slew of human philosophies, religions and doctrines that are patently-flawed on account of their over-reliance on the limited resources of human intellect and traditions. The immediate danger of reducing a supernatural God to the limits of human intellect and traditions is that it easily constrains many to resort to either doubting His existence or consigning Him to the realm of religion where He is just one of many gods! The attempt to view God through the lens of human philosophies, religions and doctrines is both futile and deeply-divisive (between God and humanity on the one hand and between the various racial and religious groups on the other hand). The conclusion is that it is only the recognition of God&amp;#39;s existence and operation as the thinking Creator and the revelation of His divine mind, mode of thinking and thoughts that can re-unite mankind both with its God and itself!    &lt;br&gt;" />
