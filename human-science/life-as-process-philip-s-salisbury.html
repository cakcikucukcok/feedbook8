  <title>Life as Process - Philip S. Salisbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about observation and process. It addresses what we observe, how we observe, and the value and consequences of how we observe. It also explores the terms of value and meaning, the attribution of value and meaning to observation, and the process of existence.
Second, this essay examines time and change and how we observe both. It discusses the concept of living in the now or living in the moment and examines their relevance to a life well lived.
Third, the essay proposes a framework for observing reality. The framework suggests that not only can we observe life from a global perspective but that we have the capacity to experience reality at multiple levels. This is where the empiricist confronts the level-of-analysis issue.
Fourth, it explores our human and assisted levels of observation. This represents a broad spectrum of innate as well as chemical, physical, and electronic devices that allow us to explore our universe, our relationships, and our personal lives.
Fifth, the essay investigates various methods that humans employed to rationalize their understandings of reality. Included in the discussion is the relevance of these practices to an individuals personal life.
In addition, the essay discusses observing the world as it is and the difficulties inherent in maintaining objectivity while observing precisely.
One of the conditions of our current environment is the loss of pragmatism. Ideologies now dominate our political discourse, be it local, statewide, national, or international. In such an environment, compromise becomes unlikely. There is a black and a white with no room for gray. The essay discusses the eventual, and alternative, consequences of this." />
