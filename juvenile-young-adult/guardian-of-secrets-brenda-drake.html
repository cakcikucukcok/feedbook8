      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The follow up to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel, THIEF OF LIES!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a Sentinel isn&#39;t all fairytales and secret gardens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, jumping through books into the world&#39;s most beautiful libraries to protect humans from mystical creatures is awesome. No one knows that better than Gia Kearns, but she could do without the part where people are always trying to kill her. Oh, and the fact that Pop and her had to move away from her friends and life as she knew it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that isn&#39;t enough, her boyfriend, Arik, is acting strangely. Like, maybe she should be calling him &quot;ex,&quot; since he&#39;s so into another girl. But she doesn&#39;t have time to be mad or even jealous, because someone has to save the world from the upcoming apocalypse, and it looks like that&#39;s going to be Gia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe. If she survives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Library Jumpers series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Thief of Lies&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Guardian of Secrets&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Assassin of Truths&lt;/p&gt;" />
