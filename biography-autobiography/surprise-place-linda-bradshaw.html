  <title>Surprise Place - Linda Bradshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Limited, means the boundary of an area.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Limitless, means no boundary, illimitable, termless, shoreless and infinite. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Living without limits is not always possible. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A tragic diagnosis, Huntingtons, delivered to me in that heavy envelope, bound me in fear and literally shut down my normal way of life with no escape. Limiting to say the least. With compassion, humour and no choice at the time, I cared for my beloved dad through his battle with Huntingtons. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You wont learn much about Huntingtons in this book but you will read a lot of the most amazing people I befriended along the way. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My heroMountain climber and Bee keeper, Sir Edmund Hillary said he felt fear believing at times he was measureless to other brave men because of it. He went ahead and climbed the mountain anyway and the rest is history. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surprise Place&lt;/i&gt; is my quest towards limitless living. Embracing for my-self, epigenetics, living in the moment and teachings from past and present masters. I didnt become them I became me through assimilating their teaching and wisdom. To be limitless would be great. When we have nothing left we are indeed limitless. I dare you limit yourself less. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My hope is that you find your surprise place as soon as possible and are surprised at mine. &lt;/P&gt;" />
