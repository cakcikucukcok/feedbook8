  <title>Tangles of Truth - Derek Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hauptmann Rolf Leutnart is a German staff officer with the famed Afrika Korps and is General Erwin Rommels favorite interpreter, fluent in Italian, French, and English.  Leutnart is assigned as the primary translator for both Italian and German senior officers.
&lt;P&gt;
While in Tunisia, Rolf meets and falls in love with Lorena Sebesta, an Italian Red Cross nurse.  For her, however, the attraction is difficult, since she despises uniforms and especially Germans.  However, the relationship grows and soon develops into a torrid love affair.
&lt;P&gt;
Later, Rolf is approached by several shadowy figures, who hint at things more sinister and possibly supernatural in Rolfs background.  He is tied to a birthmark in the shape of a wolfs head, a secret society known only as the Red Pyramid, and an ancient curse from Egypt that has awaited his arrival for 5,000 years.
&lt;P&gt;
Here is a tale of love across time, challenged by the past, present and future.  These characters interact amidst World War II, fighting for the Axis, the eventual losers of this terrible war.  Yet they are human, caught up in the questions of right and wrong, evil faced off against good.  The choices they make have personal and global impact." />
