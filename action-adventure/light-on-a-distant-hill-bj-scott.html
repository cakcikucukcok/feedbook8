Knowing tragedy is in their future, she fights against her own race for the survival of her new friendsand for her man, the Shoshone chief Bear Paw. When she is returned to white society, and on trial for murder, she must choosebetween the culture she was born to and the one in which she became a woman, between the man she was promised to and the man she has grown to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Scott, author, Light On A Distant Hill, winner of the 2011 WILLA Literary Award for Original Soft Cover Fiction by Women Writing the West. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
