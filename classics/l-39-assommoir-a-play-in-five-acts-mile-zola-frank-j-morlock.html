  <title>L&#39;Assommoir: A Play in Five Acts - Émile Zola, Frank J. Morlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Émile Zola (1840-1902) was one of France&#39;s greatest novelists of the nineteenth century, being most famous as a writer for Nana (the story of a courtesan), and in the political world for his role in exposing the frame-up of Captain Dreyfus. However, he had limited success as a dramatist until he partnered with William Busnach, an Algerian Jew. This adaptation of the Zola novel of the same name is a powerful exposé of life among the working poor, and the ravaging effects of alcholism on average, decent folk. If fact, what&#39;s most striking in this play is how human the workers are, certainly not the &quot;animals&quot; described by opponents of Zola&#39;s works. The destruction of a family is portrayed with clinical realism, but also with sympathy and understanding, as each of the characters gradually emerges as a sympathetic (or at least understandable) person in his or her own right. First-rate drama by a master writer!" />
