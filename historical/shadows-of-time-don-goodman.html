  <title>Shadows of Time - Don Goodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When they meet at a summer camp, two ten-year-old boys from opposite worlds become friends and begin an exciting series of exploits that will test their mettle and friendship. Court-ordered forced busing, for the sole purpose of integrating the school system, leads to tumultuous, chaotic times in a city suddenly torn apart by fear and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
The two boys learn the meaning of courage when each must face the shadows of time that follow them from ghetto streets riddled with crime and hostility to unexpected dangers in the local mountains. When confronted with their most jeopardous adventure, DC and Henry meet their destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
The time is the late 70&#39;s. The lives of our two young heroes become forever intertwined through circumstances no one could predict. Bravery is part of life, whether in the forests of Kentucky or in the &#39;jungles&#39; of Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
Step into this fascinating, stirring epic of two boys swept up by turbulence and chaos. This is their story in the &lt;I&gt;Shadows of Time&lt;/I&gt;." />
