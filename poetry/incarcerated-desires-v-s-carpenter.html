  <title>Incarcerated Desires - V.S. Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2011, Virginia S. Carpenter graduated from Solano Community College in Fairfield, California, by receiving two associate of arts degrees in the fields of human services and interdisciplinary studies. For her graduating class, she was one of the two selected to be valedictorian of her graduating glass. Although she was never chosen, the gratitude she experienced will never go unnoticed for years to come. 
In 2003, Virginias writing career began in Contra Costa County Jail while being confined in a single cell all by herself. Confused by her own grief, pain, and suffering, she began to search her soul, realizing the road she was traveling on would eventually lead to a solitary grave. 
One day, as she lay upon her bunk, isolated from the world, she began to pray for a transformation in her personal life. As she meditated, a voice within told her to write what I tell you and dont stop. To her surprise, she didnt know the first thing about writing, much less writing a book. Therefore, Virginia really thought she was losing her mind. Chuckling within, she did what she was instructed, and from that point on, with many sleepless nights, her writing career began. 
Virginias first book, Secrets of the Inner Heart, was based on her own spiritual battle with her God. She continued to search for some kind of peace and serenity from her carnality she encountered on a daily basis. 
In contrast to her first works, Incarcerated Desires entails a more in-depth, down-to-earth experience of carnality such as passionate love, sensual desires, prison life, homelessness, and street encounters that she struggled with on a daily basis. May all readers find inspirational satisfaction and lessons to be learned and experience life behind the walls of a prison cell. Some of Virginias works are not meant to be read by younger generations." />
