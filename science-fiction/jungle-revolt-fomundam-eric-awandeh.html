  <title>Jungle Revolt - Fomundam Eric Awandeh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the jungle of animals, where everyone is compelled to live on  edge, not knowing what to expect the next moment, misfortunes and sufferings of all types,when they befall individuals, are accepted as a natural and blessed necessity for the continuation and sustaining of life. Once in a while, however, this rule is overturned in the anguish of the pain caused by such a dreadful reality. In Jungle Revolt, the merciless slaughter of the family of Mr Pig before his own very eyes compels him, in his humbleness, to dare this long established and fast rule of the survival of the fittest in the jungle. And notwithstanding the obviously formidable challenges to such an unprecedented undertaking, he manages, at the expense of his own life, to shake the foundations of the rule leaving behind a lasting legacy that does not necessarily annul the rule, but brings relief to many.
Jungle revolt tries to explain a peculiar and age old human phenomenon. On account of different abilities and natures, stronger human beings tend to lord it on the weaker ones who, on account of their weakness are generally resigned to the undesirable fate. Occasionally, however, because of this unpleasant reality, these weak ones stand up in revolt, yearning for a better life, and even though they may not reap exactly what they desire, their situation, compelled by a Higher Power could not be exactly the same again." />
