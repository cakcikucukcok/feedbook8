  <title>The Continuous testing Handbook - Everything You Need To Know About Continuous testing - Jeffrey Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In business, art, and life, creating on a world-class level demands bold action and leaps of faith in the face of great uncertainty. But that uncertainty can lead to fear, anxiety, paralysis, and destruction. It can gut creativity and stifle innovation. It can keep you from taking the risks necessary to do great work and craft a deeply-rewarding life. And it can bring companies that rely on innovation grinding to a halt. That is, unless you know how to use it to your advantage.  Lyons draws on leading-edge technology best practices, and  awareness-focusing techniques in a fresh, practical, nondogmatic way. Their approach enables creativity and productivity on an entirely different level and can turn the once-tortuous Continuous testing journey into a more enjoyable quest. PLUS, INCLUDED with your purchase, are real-life document resources; this kit is available for instant download, giving you the tools to navigate and deliver on any Continuous testing goal." />
