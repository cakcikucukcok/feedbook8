  <title>Futures - Edison Carver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hundred years in the future, humans have finally cracked the secrets of time travel. By manipulating the energy in the Higgs Quantum Electromagnetic Field with their minds, individuals can travel freely throughout both space and timebut not without a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time travelers are disappearing in the past, never to be heard from againand no one knows why. Others are returning from the past and claiming to be from another future, another universe. They are declared insane and locked away in mental asylums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to uncover the truth, two officers from the time travel police force risk everything to get the answers they need. They break all the rules and find themselves in a different future. There, they discover a horrible truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, three super villains from a distant future have fled to our time in a desperate bid to hide from their own government. A history professor has dabbled with the Higgs Field to help an ancestor in the past, and his efforts have gone horribly wrong. The two time officers must now set things right before it is too late, but they face impossible odds as each action complicates the next, and the past may not be what it once was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many agendas and so many histories at stake, can the officers unravel the mysteries and stop the criminals before time itself is compromised?&lt;/p&gt;" />
