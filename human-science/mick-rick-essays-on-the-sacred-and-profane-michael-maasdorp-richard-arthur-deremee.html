  <title>Mick-Rick Essays on the Sacred and Profane - Michael Maasdorp, Richard Arthur DeRemee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This second Mick-Rick book begins by posing ten questions to which the authors independently respond with short essays. This format contrasts with the debates of book one. (The Mick-Rick Debates: Controversies in Contemporary Christianity) The ten Questions touch on fundamental issues facing todays Christians such as suffering, life after death, religious cosmology, moral principles and others. The intention of the questions is not to provide pat answers but, rather, to stimulate reflection on the nature and content of Christian Faith in the context of the modern world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The second part of the book consists of two essays. In Before and After the Big Bang, Rick argues it is possible to live in both the worlds of materialism as represented by science and the immaterial world of religion. Religion or the sacred provides meaning for life; science or the profane provides for our material needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mick holds the idea of traffic between the natural and supernatural destroys the foundations of modern knowledge. In his essay, On Our Own But not Alone, he suggests that to attain maturity we must also gain autonomy, neither of which survives in a world invaded by the supernatural.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book concludes with a debate on the nature of Constructs that are key mental tools used in religious and philosophical discourse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Similar to the first book, the interlocutors, Michael Maasdorp (Mick) and Richard Arthur DeRemee (Rick) conducted their conversations over the Internet on the Radical Faith web site &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepages.which.net/~radical.faith/index.htm&quot;&gt; (http://homepages.which.net/~radical.faith/index.htm)&lt;/a&gt;." />
