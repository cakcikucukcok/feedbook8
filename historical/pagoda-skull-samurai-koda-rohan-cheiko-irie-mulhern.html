  <title>Pagoda, Skull &amp; Samurai - Koda Rohan, Cheiko Irie Mulhern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This collection of Japanese literature features the works of noted Japanese novelist Koda Rohan.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Japanese literary history usually classifies Koda Rohan as an idealist writer, and the three stories included in this anthology belong to this genre. &lt;I&gt;The Five-Storied Pagoda&lt;/I&gt;, one of Koda&#39;s best-known works, is the moving account of a misunderstood carpenter who has been inspired to undertake the construction of a pagoda by himself. It is not merely a story of individualism, however, for the religious implications of such a task are profound.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Encounter with a Skull&lt;/I&gt; concerns a fortuitous meeting of two souls not necessarily ordained by karma. The multiple processes of enlightenment are perceptively depicted in this eerie tale.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The last story, &lt;I&gt;The Bearded Samurai&lt;/I&gt;, is an historical novella whose setting is the sixteenth-century battle of Nagashino between the forces of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu and those of Takeda Katsuyori. Here, the human side of the warrior and a realistic view of the samurai are delineated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Such stories, in addition to the essays and notes by the translator, will prove of interest to the general reader and especially to the reader already familiar with Japanese literature.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
