As the Third Reich targeted Europe&#39;s Jews for deportation and death, confusion and mistrust reigned. What were Hitler&#39;s aims? Did Germany&#39;s rapid early victories mark the start of an enduring new era? Was collaboration or resistance the wisest response to occupation? How far should solidarity and empathy extend? And where was God? People desperately tried to understand the horrors around them, but the stories they told themselves often justified a selfish indifference to their neighbors&#39; fates. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Piecing together the broken words of the war&#39;s witnesses and victims, Fritzsche offers a haunting picture of the most violent conflict in modern history.&lt;/div&gt;" />
