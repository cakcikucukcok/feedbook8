  <title>War at the Snow White Motel and Other Stories - Tim Wynne-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &amp;#8220;War at the Snow White Motel,&amp;#8221; Rex and his family are vacationing in Vermont. A thoughtless act launches him into war with an older teenager at their motel, but a much bigger conflict &amp;#8212; the Vietnam War &amp;#8212; looms large on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ant wants to join the #FridaysForFuture movement &amp;#8212; and impressing the new girl at school is only one good reason why. Joseph and Danny are determined to right an old wrong, no matter the consequences. Michel takes a road trip to spot a rare bird, and along the way learns what his father is really afraid of. Robin has to battle her anxiety when her great-grandfather sends her in search of an old stuffed toy with a storied past. Walker is home for the summer, in time to help his little sister expose a local company&amp;#8217;s dubious environmental practices. A boy can&amp;#8217;t figure out why the class bully won&amp;#8217;t leave him alone &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s not anything he could have foreseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Wynne-Jones brilliantly captures pivotal moments small and large as these characters fight for understanding, courage and a better future. This new collection features six brand-new stories and three that have been previously published.&lt;/p&gt;" />
