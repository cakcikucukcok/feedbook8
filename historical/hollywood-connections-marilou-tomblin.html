  <title>Hollywood Connections - Marilou Tomblin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1965 in Palo Alto, California, and drama teachers Ted and Excy Wallace are thrilled to finally receive an insurance settlement that will allow the rebuilding of their fire-ravaged Shakespearean Theatre and Learning Centre. With plans to celebrate the Centres opening with an event for the entire community, the Wallaces begin to unite all those behind the scenes who will help make their dreams a reality.&lt;p&gt; 
After Ted leaves for Los Angeles to secure a deal so his troupe can work during the rebuilding, Excy learns from her sister-in-law that his trip may not be about business after all. While a powerful and seductive woman tries to destroy their marriage, Excy turns her focus to an upcoming meeting with Hal Sonderson, an independent movie studio owner and family friend. Hal wants Ted to help write and Excy to act in his next movie, a retro musical of the Roaring Twenties in Hollywood. Only time will tell if the twists and turns in the Wallaces life together will divide or unify them and their family.&lt;p&gt;
In this intriguing tale set during the turbulent sixties in America, four generations of a wealthy California family are unwittingly intertwined by their love for Shakespearean theatre and the Roaring Twenties." />
