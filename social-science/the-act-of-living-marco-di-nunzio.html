  <title>The Act of Living - Marco Di Nunzio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;According to the World Bank, Ethiopia has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa, yet it is also one of the poorest African countries. Marco Di Nunzio&#39;s analysis of two street hustlers in Ethiopia offers an incredible insight to the ongoing debates about the success or failure of African nation states. Replete with fascinating characters, multi-layered narratives, and alternative definitions of success, &lt;I&gt;The Act of Living&lt;/I&gt; uncovers the livelihoods and expectations of those at the edge of Ethiopia&#39;s success in recent times.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Di Nunzio&#39;s ethnography examines the relationship between desires, expectations, and success through the uncomfortable and messy realities of those who are supposed to be the ultimate beneficiaries of economic growth: the urban poor. Di Nunzio follows the life trajectories of two men he calls &quot;Haile&quot; and &quot;Ibrahim,&quot; observing them as they grow up in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, enter the street economy to get by, and through their quest for a better life. From their perspective, economic growth and development hinder, not harness, their desires for social improvement. For them, and many others, economic growth has exacerbated patterns of social exclusion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By narrating Haile and Ibrahim&#39;s lives, &lt;I&gt;The Act of Living&lt;/I&gt; explores how and why development fails the poor, how marginality is understood and acted upon in a time of promise, and why poor people&#39;s claims for open-endedness can lead to better and more just alternative futures. Tying together anthropology, African studies, political science, and urban studies, Di Nunzio takes readers on a bold exploration of the meaning of economic success, empowerment, marginality, and street life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
