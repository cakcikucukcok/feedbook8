  <title>Beyond the Crossroads - Emmett Diggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;If youre at a crossroads then Beyond the Crossroads is for you.  Heres good advicedont stay there.  The message here is about how to keep traveling the streets of life.  How to keep on faithing no matter how rugged the pathway.  Now is the time to venture into adventure!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You cannot read Beyond the Crossroads and not feel challenged to move on, to take a leap of faith beyond spiritual stagnation.  If youve been grounded like a tame old duck then now is the time to take off and fly high into the exhilarating winds of freedom.  Dont seek safetyseek abundant living for Jesus promises no less.  Grounded faith is an oxymoron!  We must never become impotent in pursuit of our spiritual questing.  Never!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As one who walked among us Jesus was considered the village quack, homeless and eventually a convicted  criminal, sentenced to the cross.  But he remained free!  No cross, no tombnot even death could restrict his vocation.  Why?  Because at the crossroads, Jesus moved on.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Living in beyondness, centered on God, and with an incredible sense of freedom is crucial to the faith journey.  Seeking faith as Jesus had faith allows you to become free too!  Salvation is the name of this street.  Travel on it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
