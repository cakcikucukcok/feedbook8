  <title>The Call of the Wild, White Fang, To Build a Fire and Other Stories - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="American author, journalist, and social activist Jack London is best known for his stories set during the Klondike gold rush. Drawing upon his own personal experiences in the Klondike, London&#39;s stories are embodied with realism indicative of that experience. In this collection, &quot;The Call of the Wild, White Fang, To Build a Fire and Other Stories,&quot; London&#39;s most famous works are brought together. &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; follows the struggle of Buck, a domesticated dog, who is snatched from a pastoral ranch in California and is sold into a brutal life as a sled dog in the Yukon. &quot;White Fang&quot;, described as a mirror to &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, conversely details a wild wolfdog&#39;s journey to domestication. By telling these stories through the viewpoint of the animals London explores the struggle of humankind between its wild nature and the demands of civilization. These novellas as well as the short stories &quot;Batard&quot;, &quot;Love of Life&quot;, and &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; are collected here in this edition and exhibit why London become one of the most popular writers of the early part of the twentieth century." />
