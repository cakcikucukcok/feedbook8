  <title>Mirroring People - Marco Iacoboni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What accounts for the remarkable ability to get inside another person&#39;s head--to know what they&#39;re thinking and feeling? &quot;Mind reading&quot; is the very heart of what it means to be human, creating a bridge between self and others that is fundamental to the development of culture and society. But until recently, scientists didn&#39;t understand what in the brain makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has all changed in the last decade. Marco Iacoboni, a leading neuroscientist whose work has been covered in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, explains the groundbreaking research into mirror neurons, the &quot;smart cells&quot; in our brain that allow us to understand others. From imitation to morality, from learning to addiction, from political affiliations to consumer choices, mirror neurons seem to have properties that are relevant to all these aspects of social cognition. As &lt;i&gt;The New York Times &lt;/i&gt;reports: &quot;The discovery is shaking up numerous scientific disciplines, shifting the understanding of culture, empathy, philosophy, language, imitation, autism and psychotherapy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mirroring People &lt;/i&gt;is the first book for the general reader on this revolutionary new science.&lt;/p&gt;" />
