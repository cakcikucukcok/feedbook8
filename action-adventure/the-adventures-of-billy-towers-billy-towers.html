  <title>The Adventures of Billy Towers - Billy Towers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one ever thinks of how interesting their life is mostly because they live it day in and day out for twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and three-hundred-sixty-five days a year. Until someone is actually allowed the time to reflect on those moments in life that were magical, they simply fade in with the others, making every day feel like just another day. In The Adventures of Billy Towers, a young man discovers how interesting life can be when he goes and searches for adventure and, sometimes, when adventure finds him. In these adventures, he learns about his friends, his family, himself, and the world around him in ways he never thought were possible." />
