  <title>Man With A Miracle (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (The Men of Maple Hill, Book 3) - Muriel Jensen</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes a girl needs a miracle…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beazie Deadham is alone and on the run. She witnessed the murder of her boss in an underground parking lot in Boston, and accepted an incriminating tape from him, which he told her to deliver to &quot;Evan&quot; in Maple Hill. Now the perpetrators of the crime are after her as well as the tape.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;This man has one!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Evan Braga has moved to quiet Maple Hill, Massachusetts, to escape his past as a big-city cop. He&#39;s also trying to sort out the guilt he feels over his brother&#39;s death. He&#39;s not looking for all the trouble that gorgeous redhead Beazie Deadham drops on his doorstep. Especially once he discovers that Beazie was mixed up with his brother, and his brother might have been mixed up with the tape Beazie&#39;s trying so hard to unload.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when the Boston thugs track Beazie down, Evan–and his family, who show up unexpectedly at Christmas–would go to the ends of the earth to protect her!&lt;/p&gt;
