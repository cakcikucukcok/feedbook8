  <title>20 Must-Read Thriller Novels - Grant Allen, Randall Garrett, Thomas Hardy, Edgar Wallace...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A thriller novel is a novel that uses suspense, excitement, apprehension and exhilaration to tell a story. Thriller novels have villains, suspense, and action in settings such as espionage, medicine, crime, politics, and high tech.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They often involve life and death situations and have high stakes, like the control of the world or the possibility of widespread death or destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many times innocent people are victimized, stalked, or caught in situations that are beyond their control.&lt;br /&gt;
Characters have to overcome obstacles, either alone or with a small group of people, and stop some catastrophe from happening. Thrillers usually have a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;
