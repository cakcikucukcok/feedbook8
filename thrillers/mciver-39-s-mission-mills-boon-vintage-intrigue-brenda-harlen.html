        &lt;p&gt;BULLETS. ARSON. BOMBS. SOMEONE WANTED HER DEAD.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Arden Doherty had dedicated her career to protecting families, but now her own life was on the line. The driven attorney hadn&#39;t thought things could get any more dangerous…until she wound up in bed with Shaun McIver. He was a colleague, a friend–she couldn&#39;t afford anything more. Now Shaun was hell-bent on keeping Arden safe from the unknown danger that stalked her, no matter the risk. He promised she wouldn&#39;t get hurt, but it was no longer the physical danger that concerned Arden most. How could she keep sharing her body with this incredible man and keep her heart intact?&lt;/p&gt;
