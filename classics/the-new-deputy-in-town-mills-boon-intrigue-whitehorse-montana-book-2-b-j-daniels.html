          &lt;strong&gt;A gorgeous lawman vs. a dangerous killer! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some days it seems like everyone in Whitehorse has a secret – including their new cop, Deputy Sheriff Nick Rogers. And falling for feisty local girl Laney isn’t a good way to maintain a low profile. Especially not when Laney’s sister and cousin are accused of being involved in a murder that has the whole town talking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still, dedicated and determined Nick will do anything to help the woman he loves clear her family’s name – and to catch the true killer! But could drawing attention to himself bring his own dark past to Whitehorse?&lt;/p&gt;
