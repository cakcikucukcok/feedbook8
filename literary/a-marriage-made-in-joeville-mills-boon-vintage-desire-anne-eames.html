          &lt;strong&gt;SCANDALOUS COWBOY!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Ryder Malone announced his plans to marry an older, frail-looking brothel owner with a fatherless little boy, Savannah Smith knew something wasn&#39;t right in Joeville, Montana. The bride-to-be aside, how had a sexy loner - long-estranged from his own family - become devoted to a kid that wasn&#39;t his?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All Savannah knew was that Ryder had been the husband of her dreams since high school. And considering that he&#39;d introduced her to the wonders of passion mere nights before his shocking announcement, the only woman Ryder was walking down the aisle with was Savannah!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE MONTANA MALONES: &lt;em&gt;Three sexy brothers whose lips are sealed with their secrets… &#39;til passion pries &#39;em loose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
