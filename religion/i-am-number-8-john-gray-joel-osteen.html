  <title>I Am Number 8 - John Gray, Joel Osteen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;If God can take David--the invisible eighth son of a forgotten family--and turn him into a king, just imagine what magnificent plans He has for redeeming your life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;David was born a number 8--a hidden gem, often overlooked and undervalued by everyone except for God. For David, being a number 8 seemed like a curse until the day God transformed him from the unknown eighth son of Jesse into the much-honored king of Israel. &lt;/div&gt;When God sends out an invitation to greatness, His directions don&#39;t always make sense to us. You may feel like the most invisible, broken number 8 out there, but God sees your hidden value and is growing you for better things. David didn&#39;t know it, but his time as a simple shepherd with a dull future did not go unnoticed by God. In David&#39;s darkest moments, he was cultivating the kind of gifts, wisdom, and leadership he would need to become a king. Even when you&#39;re an underdog in the eyes of the world, God is working behind the scenes to develop you into a king or queen." />
