  <title>Parenting Children with Mental Health Challenges - Deborah Vlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Parenting Children with Mental Health Challenges: A Guide to Life with Emotionally Complex Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; offers overwhelmed readers guidance, solidarity, and hope. The author, a &amp;ldquo;mental-health mom&amp;rdquo; who&amp;rsquo;s survived indignity, exhaustion, and the heartbreak of loving a child with multiple mental-health disorders, writes with frankness and occasional humor about the hardest parenting job on earth. Drawing on her own experiences and those of other parents, plus tips from mental health professionals, Vlock suggests ways of parenting smarter, partnering better, and living more fully and less fearfully in the shadow of childhood psychiatric illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Addressing the many hurdles children and families must face, including life on the home front, school, friendships and relationships, and more, the book shows readers that they&amp;rsquo;re not alone&amp;mdash;and they are stronger than they think. With its combination of easily digestible, to-the-point suggestions, clear action items, and first-person parent/kid stories, its aim is to make mental-health parents feel stronger and better, while actively seeking positive outcomes for their kids and families. With rates of mental health diagnoses among youth on the rise, this invaluable resource will help parents through the trying times with support, understanding, and guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
