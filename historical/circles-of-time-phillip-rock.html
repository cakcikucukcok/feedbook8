  <title>Circles of Time - Phillip Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Acclaimed Trilogy That Has Been Called a Must-Read for Fans of &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generation has been lost on the Western Front. The dead have been buried, a harsh peace forged, and the howl of shells replaced by the wail of saxophones as the Jazz Age begins. But ghosts linger&amp;#8212;that long-ago golden summer of 1914 tugging at the memory of Martin Rilke and his British cousins, the Grevilles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the countess to the chauffeur, the inhabitants of Abingdon Pryory seek to forget the past and adjust their lives to a new era in which old values, social codes, and sexual mores have been irretrievably swept away. Martin Rilke throws himself into reporting, discovering unsettling political currents, as Fenton Wood-Lacy faces exile in faraway army outposts. Back at Abingdon, Charles Greville shows signs of recovery from shell shock and Alexandra is caught up in an unlikely romance. &lt;em&gt;Circles of Time&lt;/em&gt; captures the age as these strongly drawn characters experience it, unfolding against England&amp;#39;s most gracious manor house, the steamy nightclubs of London&amp;#39;s Soho, and the despair of Germany caught in the nightmare of anarchy and inflation. Lives are renewed, new loves found, and a future of peace and happiness is glimpsed&amp;#8212;for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
