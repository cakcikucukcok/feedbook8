  <title>When Spirits Speak: a Gathering of Heroes - Jeri K. Tory Conklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The stories in this book are from soldiers who once served in Vietnam and who have contacted me via the world of spirit. Their stories are filled with the dreams of young men who grew into adults all too quickly in a land not their own. They speak of the bond between soldiers; the brotherhood that stands the test of time and distance; the fear they lived with each day; how they wrote letters that would be sent to their families if they were killed; and the simple things they came to take for granted. Some speak of their love of Vietnam and its people. And many of them convey their last few hours on the earthly plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeri Tory Conklina gifted intuitive, archaeologist, and investigative authoragain lifts the veil between the visible and invisible world, this time to give us an inside perspective on veteran experiences during the Vietnam War. An eye-opening, inspirational book.&lt;br&gt;
Patricia Johnston, professor of anthropology; owner, grief coach at Purple Lotus Coaching http://purplelotuscoaching.com/&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking answers to Why, is there no peace? comes to us all when we send a loved one or venture into the path of war.  Living without closure bids us to seek out those with The Gift of sight into the world of spirit. I have found closure within these pages. Your eyes will be opened, if you have lost a loved one to death on a battlefield. &lt;BR&gt;
