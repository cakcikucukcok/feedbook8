  <title>Dna 9419 - A. J. Caro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following the death of his mother due to cancer, Dr. Ryan Carter made a promise to himself that he would cure the odious disease and save the world from further pain. It took time, but finally, he has done it. He has found the cure for cancer, with the help of his ever-present teamLiz, a skilled geneticist, and Ethan, Ryans second-in-command. Now, he is ready to announce his amazing discovery to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz has other things on her mind. Not only does she harbor a mysterious secret, but she has developed feelings for the good doctor over the course of their work together. Of course, Ryan is too focused on his recent achievement to notice her, so she has resigned herself to living in his shadowuntil there is a murder attempt that threatens both their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in protective custody, Liz and Ryans relationship begins to bloom, but theres no time to enjoy their newfound love. Questions abound, and they have no idea who wants them dead. Ryan is also working on cures for diseases like HIV and cystic fibrosis. He has the power to save mankind from disease and death, but first he must outlive his pursuers. But do the death threats really relate to Ryans cure, or is Lizs secret putting them both in danger?&lt;/p&gt;" />
