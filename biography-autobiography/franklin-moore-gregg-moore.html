  <title>Franklin Moore - Gregg Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about Franklin Oritsemi MooreI almost said my father, but he was our father as he had many children, both sons and daughters. The first thing I noticed about him was his dress patterna very rigid and regimented suit and tie that he wore from Monday to Friday and, before, up to Saturday. Before the workday was changed to six to five, Saturday used to be a half-day workday. He always wore long shirts and wrappers to church on Sundays at the First Baptist Church in Lagos, by Broad Street and Joseph Street, and, later, on Saturdays too to functions. He wore just wrappers and was always bare-chested at home. Sometimes, he wore just a singlet on top!
Apart from his way of dressing, he was always in a hurry to get to work and would not listen to anything in the mornings before work, making us children (sons) have to catch him after work or before he lay in bed for the night. He had many sides and was very soft-spoken and generous, almost to a fault. He loved women, or should I say women really loved him, and I think I navigated through them to the best of my ability. In many ways, he was special, and I guess it started in his youth, even before becoming a man. Or why should his immediate family call him a brand of the white man Oyibotie and not Oritsemi, his real native name? He loved his children and accountancy, his life profession, and he played superior soccer. He also attended the best school in the world, the Government College Ibadan (GCI). I suppose it was there where he first met white students as classmates and dormitory mates.
Daddy Frank did a lot in his short life and truly represented his dad, Sir William A. Moore, and his granddad Akinbo, which the Itsekiris transformed to Akenbo for the singular crime of leaving his homestead to the Itsekiri kingdom and also marrying the daughter of the king! There is more information about him in the book. Just read on.
