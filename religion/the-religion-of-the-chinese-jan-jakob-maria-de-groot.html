  <title>The Religion of The Chinese - Jan Jakob Maria de Groot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &amp;quot;The Religion of The Chinese&amp;quot;, scholarly book published in 1910, Jan Jakob Maria de Groot details the history, rituals, and beliefs of the major traditional religions of China: &amp;nbsp;universal animism, polydemonism, specters, ancestral worship, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. He thought that one spiritual essence could be detected beneath a great variety of religious, philosophical, and even political expressions in China, and his lifework was the discovery and exposition of that essence. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Religion of The Chinese&amp;quot; was written while China was still under its imperial system of government with an emperor at its head, prior to the revolutions which established a republic and later a communist system that eschewed any state religion. &amp;nbsp;Currently, China is officially an atheist country.&amp;nbsp; However, at present China&amp;#39;s religions are &amp;quot;Daoist (Taoist), Buddhist, Christian 3%-4%, Muslim 1%-2%&amp;quot;. Hence, although this book was written more than 100 years ago, it is still relevant to modern China&amp;#39;s culture and traditions.&lt;br /&gt;
