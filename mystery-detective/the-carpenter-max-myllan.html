  <title>The Carpenter - Max Myllan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Eric James Donovan, a carpenter by trade and former black ops squad leader, distraught from the ravages of the Great Recession, is offered a Faustian bargain, he discovers &quot;anyone will do anything if they are tempted enough or desperate enough.&quot; Eric accepts the deal from a dark figure calling himself a mediator and plans an assassination of a powerful real estate scammer and billionaire. Eric has never failed in any of his missions for his country. His weapon of choice is a powerful neurotoxin, TTX. Eric violates his principles and risks everything to carry out the assignment. After an introduction to a seductive criminal defense attorney involved in bi sexual encounters, murder for profit and underworld clientele, Eric has moments of despair and seeks out counseling by the family priest. Father Tom, a retread with a surreptitious past, knows Eric better than his own father and guides Eric in a disturbing manner for a Father Confessor. Everything falls into place for Eric to have the opportunity to complete his project. As you learn about Eric and his plight from dealing with death to financial ruin, you sense righteousness. He reluctantly exchanges his convictions for new pleasures. When informed by the mediator, &quot;Nothing is ever as it seems, nor is it otherwise&quot; we are exposed to the twists, turns and unexpected connections of all of the characters in this dark and edgy tale. This is the first book in The Blue Collar Assassin Series. - See more at: http://christophermatthewspub.com/carpenter/#sthash.86yAzzSs.dpuf" />
