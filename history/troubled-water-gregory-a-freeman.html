  <title>Troubled Water - Gregory A. Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the vein of &lt;i&gt;Crimson Tide&lt;/i&gt;, with action pulled straight from a high seas thriller, this is the exciting story of a mutiny that the U.S. Navy denies to this day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1972, the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk was headed to her station in the Gulf of Tonkin when many of the five thousand men cooped up for the longest at-sea tour of the unpopular war rioted -- or, as Freeman claims, mutinied. Most disturbingly, the lines were drawn racially, black against white. By the time order was restored, careers were forever ruined, but the incident became a turning point for race relations in the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through careful and unprecedented examination of the official record and eyewitness accounts, Freeman refutes the official story of the incident, and makes a convincing case for &lt;i&gt;the first mutiny in U.S. Navy history&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
