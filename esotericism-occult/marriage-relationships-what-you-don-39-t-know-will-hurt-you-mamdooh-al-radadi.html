  <title>Marriage &amp; Relationships: What you don&#39;t know will hurt you! - Mamdooh Al-Radadi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mamdooh Al-Radadi takes a hit at the social arena for destroying the sacred shrine called marriage and relationships. Through a very straightforward and direct approach he tackles the issue from a different angel, not what they say, but what you have to say!  A light read, a powerful shock treatment to anyone thinking of relationships, getting ready to tie the knot, or in a relationship and wondering what went wrong?  A very direct and harsh set of questions to ask yourself, answering is up to you! But trust me on the deep insider information.  Usual and conventional doesn&#39;t exist in Mamdooh&#39;s book, especially when you know that he&#39;s been in and out of marriage twice, meaning two of everything; Love, heart breaks, disappointment and now is a much wiser and knowledgable individual based on personal experience.  If you want honest and real advice, it rarely gets better than this." />
