  <title>The Fall City Mandate - Kurt Philip Behm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The third in a series of nine novels (historical fiction),
about the Simpson/Reynolds family and their heroic
tradition of defending America and keeping her safe
from all enemies foreign and domestic.
This book, &#39;The Fall City Mandate,&#39; is actually set in real
time and jumps ahead of the other two that take place between
1876 and 1915.  There will be six more novels to fill in
the time between the 1st World War and Gulf War 1.
The link between all the characters (male and female) throughout
all time periods is they have all won the &#39;Congressional Medal of
Honor&#39; for extreme heroism and bravery.
Wilhelmina (Boomer) Simpson is actually the 1st woman to be awarded
the medal for heroism during World War 1.
Nat Reynolds, the hero of &#39;The Fall City Mandate,&#39; is a newly elected
Congressman from the Annapolis District of Maryland.  Nat is an ex-Navy
Seal (if there is such a thing), and runs on a platform of instituting term
limits in the Congress and overhauling and revamping the Congress&#39; health
and pension benefits.
Needless to say, this creates a firestorm among the landed gentry and the
plot starts from there ....." />
