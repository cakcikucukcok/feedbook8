  <title>The Mediums Handbook - Rev. Gordon  M. Bromley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is a book that has no competition. It is unique in that it covers the
whole spectrum of mediumship. There are many books in the market about
various pieces of what a medium needs to know, but this is the only one that
not only covers those subjects all together in one book, but also includes other
areas that do not usually get taught.
I have been involved in spiritual aspects for over fifty-five years, with over
thirty years demonstrating and teaching, including running open and closed
circles. I have also been the circle leader for physical phenomena, where there
were materialisations on a regular basis. I have demonstrated and taught in the
Netherlands, Spain, USA, Germany, Denmark, and UK.
I have spent thirty years of my life writing nonfi ction in the area of
engineering. These books covered operating and maintenance manuals on a
very wide scale. These include mechanical, electrical, electronic, pneumatic,
hydraulic, refrigeration, photographic, and optical disciplines.
This book is not only intended as a basic tutorial for novices, but also as a
reference book on spiritual information for spiritual teachers.
Author quote: I know that our loved ones communicate with us, but it often
takes a competent medium to relay the information." />
