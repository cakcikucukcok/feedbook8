  <title>The Intermediate American Bidding System - Chris Hasney, Jerry Pottier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the American Bridge Series&lt;/h2&gt;
The American Bridge Series is designed as a sequential set of bidding
courses, suitable for self-study or classroom-style study under the
guidance of a professional bridge teacher. Volumes I through III include
declarer play and defense skills as they relate to the bidding skills
taught in each text. Volume IV is reserved for true experts; thus, declarer
play and defense lessons would be an insult and are not included. The
entire series takes about five years of study and practice to complete.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.trafford.com/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000152656&quot;&gt;Volume I, The Basic American Bidding System&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/B&gt; was written for beginners and for social players who need to brush-up on
basic bidding skills prior to tackling modern bidding methods. It features
5-card major suit opening bids, strong twos, and some basics of Forcing and
Non-Forcing Stayman, Blackwood, Gerber, and few other things designed to
form the framework for further study.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Volume II, The Intermediate American Bidding System&lt;/b&gt; makes the transition to modern methods including weak two
openings. It teaches all of the pieces of &quot;Standard&quot; American in a way that
integrates all of the varied forms of same.  Don&#39;t be thrown by the term
&quot;intermediate.&quot; Many duplicate players think that they have reached that
level when they can no longer play in novice games. Not so. &quot;Intermediate,&quot;
as defined by the authors, can vary from folks with zero ACBL masterpoints
to 2500 masterpoints. It&#39;s not the points that count, it&#39;s the skill level.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.trafford.com/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000157759&quot;&gt;Volume III, The Advanced American Bidding
System&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
 presumes a complete understanding and skill with all of the
material in Volume II. However, some of the Volume II material is repeated
for intended redundancy, since the authors suspect that many folks who
shouldn&#39;t be attempting to study Volume III will do so anyway. After all,
&quot;I&#39;m a Life Master, I must be Advanced.&quot; The authors suggest that anyone
not comfortable playing in Flight A at an ACBL regional or national
tournament, or the World Bridge Federation (WBF) or other governing body
equivalent thereof avoid purchase and study of Volume III until they have
mastered all that is taught in Volume II.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Volume IV, The Expert American Bidding System&lt;/b&gt;, (NOT YET RELEASED) presumes two years&#39; experience with the bidding techniques
taught in Volume III, and expert declarer play and defense skills. This is
not a &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; book. It is for those who wish to successfully compete
in such ACBL events as Flight A Grand National Teams, the Blue Ribbon
Pairs, the Life Master Pairs, the Spingold, Vanderbilt, and Reisinger
teams, etc., and International events like the Bermuda Bowl and Venice Cup,
The London Times Pairs, the McCallan, etc. It features 4-card majors, the
TEAS responses to no trump openings, weak no trumps, and a variety of other
bidding methods which will get bidders to the optimum place but will
require expert declarer play or defensive skills to maximize results.
&lt;P&gt;
All four books emphasize sound, disciplined bidding and an underlying
philosophy of &quot;You bid your cards, I&#39;ll bid mine, we&#39;ll get to the right
spot.&quot; By the time students complete study and practice of Volume III, they
should be able to know what cards partner holds almost to the spot at the
conclusion of an auction. In fact, Jerry and one of his partners were once
accused of cheating when they got cocky and did this after an auction. The
comment was: &quot;How can you know what cards your partner holds?&quot; Jerry&#39;s
answer: &quot;Isn&#39;t that the whole point of the bidding?&quot;" />
