      <meta name="description" content="Taboo role-play leads two very different girls and handsome &amp;#39;uncle&amp;#39; toward the night of their dreams and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He adopted the role of intimate teacher to a rebellious, tattooed teen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will he now adopt a more taboo role to fulfill the forbidden fantasies of her good-girl friend?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All &amp;#39;incest&amp;#39; depicted is role-play only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Look at you! Damn, Uncle Jack, you are seriously fit.&amp;quot; Fingers grazed over my t-shirt, tracing a pectoral muscle. &amp;quot;Too bad you never had any kids.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Kids? Why?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Genetics. Breeding. They&amp;#39;d likely be models. Or athletes. I might even want one for myself. Turn around.&amp;quot; She hooked a finger into a belt loop, encouraging me to turn. I was having trouble keeping up with her, went along with her request.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; She sounded like she was speaking to herself. &amp;quot;Good genes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt hands stroke down the sides of my back, tracing the V shape from the wider lat&amp;#39; muscles to my narrowed waist. I was proud of how my renewed swimming workouts had sculpted my 50-year old body. &amp;quot;Very good genes. Some men really do look good in a simple pair of Levi&amp;#39;s.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, she smacked one cheek of my butt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey!&amp;quot; I spun to face her. &amp;quot;Good genes or good jeans? I thought you were talking about genetics.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do I have to pick just one? A hot guy in the right jeans can make me think about breeding.&amp;quot; Her eyes were bright, darting, studying my face. I thought I might be blushing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tracy. Don&amp;#39;t tease an old man. I&amp;#39;m twice your age.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Uh...more than twice, Uncle Jack. I&amp;#39;m 21. You just turned 50 if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ouch. That doesn&amp;#39;t help.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot; Another quick pout, then she wrapped me in her arms. &amp;quot;It is good to see you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sniffed at me again, lower, near my collar bone. &amp;quot;And it&amp;#39;s good to smell you. Damn.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tracy...&amp;quot; I tried to sound stern.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She leaned back to look up at me, leaving her arms cinched around my middle. It pressed her lower body closer to mine and gave me a clear view into the shadowy valley dividing the small rises of her chest. A bead of moisture there glistened, reminding me of the two glinting piercings, blue and gold, now hidden. Something stirred low in my groin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Like I said, some guys look good. And good looks can be enough to get me thinking about...genetics and stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;#39;t say the word this time, but my brain whispered breeding.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s just looks.&amp;quot; She leaned her face in, stealing another quick sniff. She shook her head, as though trying to clear sudden cobwebs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now a guy that smells good? The right kind of good? Thinking goes right out the window. Something buried deep in a girl&amp;#39;s programming goes straight to mating. Breeding.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes were full of twinkling mischief now. And something else. More intense. I tried to ignore that part. &amp;quot;And men. Men smell different than boys. Better.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The way she said &amp;#39;boys&amp;#39; seemed dismissive, almost disdained.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes dropped, suddenly shy. &amp;quot;Maybe I should shut up about now.&amp;quot;" />
