  <title>Steel - Richard Matheson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine a future in which the sport of boxing has gone high-tech.  Human boxers have been replaced by massive humanoid robots.   And former champions of flesh-and-blood are obsolete . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Matheson&#39;s classic short story is now the basis for&lt;i&gt; Real Steel&lt;/i&gt;, a gritty, white-knuckle film starring Hugh Jackman.  But &quot;Steel,&quot; which was previously filmed as a powerful episode of the original &lt;i&gt;Twilight Zone&lt;/i&gt; television series, is just one of over a dozen unforgettable tales in this outstanding collection, which includes two new stories that have never appeared in any previous Matheson collection.  Also featured is a bizarre satirical fantasy, &quot;The Splendid Source,&quot; that was turned into an episode of &lt;i&gt;The Family Guy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Richard Matheson was recently inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame.  &lt;i&gt;Steel&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates once again the full range of his legendary imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
