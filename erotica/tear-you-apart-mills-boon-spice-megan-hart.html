  <title>Tear You Apart (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Megan Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;I’m on a train. I don’t know which stop I got on at; I only know the train is going fast and the world outside becomes a blur. I should get off, but I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The universe is playing a cosmic joke on me. Here I had my life – a good life with everything a woman could want – and suddenly, there is something more I didn’t know I could have. A chance for me to be satisfied and content and maybe even on occasion deliriously, amazingly, exuberantly fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So this is where I am, on a train that’s out of control, and I am not just a passenger. I’m the one shovelling the furnace full of coal to keep it going fast and faster. If I could make myself believe it all happened by chance and I couldn’t help it, that I’ve been swept away, that it’s not my fault, that it’s fate… would that be easier? The truth is, I didn’t know I was looking for this until I found Will, but I must’ve been, all this time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And now it is not random, it is not fate, it is not being swept away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And I don’t know how to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or even if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
