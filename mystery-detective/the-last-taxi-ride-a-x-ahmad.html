  <title>The Last Taxi Ride - A. X. Ahmad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New York City taxi driver Ranjit Singh, hero of A.X. Ahmad&#39;s heralded debut &lt;i&gt;The Caretaker,&lt;/i&gt; has 10 days to prove his innocence...&lt;br&gt;Bollywood film icon Shabana Shah has been murdered, her body found in the apartment where Ranjit ate dinner mere hours before. Ranjit&#39;s fingerprints are all over the murder weapon, a statue of the elephant god Ganesh used to grotesquely smash the actress&#39; beautiful face. Caught on film leaving the apartment alone, Ranjit is accused by the NYPD as an accessory to murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranjit&#39;s only credible alibi is Shabana&#39;s Indian doorman, but he has vanished. With a Grand Jury arraignment looming in 10 days, and Ranjit&#39;s teenage daughter about to arrive from India, he must find the doorman. His search through the underbelly of New York leads to the world of high-end nightclub owners, back-alley Mumbai gangsters and to Jay Patel, a shady businessman who imports human hair. As his investigation for the true killer reveals layers of Shabana Shah&#39;s hidden past, Ranjit does not know whom to trust. He can rely only on his army training, his taxi-driver knowledge of New York, and his cabbie friends. &lt;br&gt;With time quickly running out, can Ranjit clear his name before his fare is up? &lt;i&gt;The Last Taxi Ride&lt;/i&gt; is the second novel in the Ranjit Singh trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
