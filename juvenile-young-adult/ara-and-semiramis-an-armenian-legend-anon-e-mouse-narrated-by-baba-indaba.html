  <title>ARA AND SEMIRAMIS - An Armenian Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In issue 20 of the Baba Indaba Children&amp;#39;s Stories, Baba Indaba narrates the Armenian tale of how Queen Semiramis desired King Ara for her consort. King Ara rebuffed all her advances. Filled with rage she attacked King Ara&amp;rsquo;s kingdom, with disastrous results. How disastrous you ask? Well, lets say things did not work out the way Queen Semiramis planned. Download and read this Armenian story for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - all places can be found using Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In looking up these place names, using Google Maps, it is our hope that young people will click on the images and do further investigations about the people who live in these towns in order to gain an understanding of the many and varied cultures there are around the world. Through such an exercise, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their knowledge of world geography but also increase their appreciation and tolerance of other peoples and cultures.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
