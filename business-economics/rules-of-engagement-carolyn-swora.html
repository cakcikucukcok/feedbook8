  <title>Rules of Engagement - Carolyn Swora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Look around the typical workplace. People are overwhelmed. They&amp;rsquo;re unengaged; or worse, disengaged. At home and at work, the world is changing too fast, and people simply can&amp;rsquo;t cope. No matter how skilful someone is, faced with a barrage of new information, unstructured data, and &amp;ldquo;disruptive&amp;rdquo; technologies, they simply don&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity to leverage those skills, let alone &amp;ldquo;shine&amp;rdquo; in their role. Now add into that mix markets in turmoil, an ever-shifting competitive landscape, and increasingly sophisticated and demanding customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inevitable result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees who are disconnected. Disconnected from their employer. Disconnected from their leaders. Disconnected from their customers. Disconnected from each other. So, they battle through, their performance gradually worsening, until they either take sick leave or simply walk away in hopes of finding something better somewhere&amp;mdash;anywhere&amp;mdash;else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rules of Engagement, Carolyn Swora draws on 20 years&amp;rsquo; experience as a senior leader in a highly volatile industry to present a new way of thinking, leading, and working that addresses the complexity and overwhelm of modern working life so that your employees can develop new skills to thrive in this workplace of the future&amp;mdash;a workplace that has rapidly become the workplace of today!&lt;/p&gt;" />
