  <title>Nature and Experience - Bryan Bannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What do we mean when we speak about and advocate for &amp;lsquo;nature&amp;rsquo;? Do inanimate beings possess agency, and if so what is its structure? What role does metaphor play in our understanding of and relation to the environment? How does nature contribute to human well-being? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By bringing the concerns and methods of phenomenology to bear on questions such as these, this book seeks to redefine how environmental issues are perceived and discussed and demonstrates the relevance of phenomenological inquiry to a broader audience in environmental studies. The book examines what phenomenology must be like to address the practical and philosophical issues that emerge within environmental philosophy, what practical contributions phenomenology might make to environmental studies and policy making more generally, and the nature of our human relationship with the environment and the best way for us to engage with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
