  <title>A Passion to Learn - Raymond D., Sandra S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instilling a passion to learn early in kids lives can make a huge difference in their success and their enjoyment in life.&lt;/p&gt;
And helping kids find that passion can create a vitality and sense of purpose that can enrich our own lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray and Sandy share their personal stories of getting through their school years without finding a passion that made sense of their educational paths. Today, schools are less and less able to provide the experiential education that could spark kids passion for learning. Budgets, curriculum mandates, time-consuming coursework, and testing all combine to make it more and more difficult for teachers to expose their students to experiences that could fire their ambition and create a passion for learning that could help them achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The stories in this book provide a taste of what is possible. The book also challenges readers to consider their own ideas and find a way to get involved. Ray and Sandy offer a format for developing experiential-education projects so they are viable and self-sustaining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a win-win! Students develop a passion for learning and adults are rewarded with vitality and purpose that can carry them through their active pre- and post-retirement years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
