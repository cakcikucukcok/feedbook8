  <title>Ease - Eileen Chadnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in times of unprecedented busyness. The demands and pace of work and life are at an all-time high, and they dont appear to be slowing down. Whether our loads are self-imposed or put on us by others, most of us are doing our best to squeeze it all inand were starting to burst at the seams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ease, author and certified coach Eileen Chadnick offers a prescription for these busy times with a toolkit of hundreds of tips and strategies to bring more ease into your work and life. The strategiestried and tested through Chadnicks personal experience with herself and her clientsdraw from the wisdom of neuroscience, emotional intelligence, positive psychology, leadership, and coaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ease, Chadnick divides the tools into three areas of focus to leverage the mind-brain connection, empower mindful thinking strategies, and highlight the positivity advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ease is about more than just getting things done; it seeks to help you alleviate overwhelm, reconnect with your work-life mojo, and experience greater personal and professional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooted in science, research, and common sense, Ease is a powerful and thoughtful book to help us all manage our frenetic lives. Best of all, it reads like youre in the room, one-on-one, with coaching pro Eileen Chadnick. And I can tell you from personal experience, thats a wonderful place to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Fallis, award-winning author of The Best Laid Plans and cofounder of Thornley Fallis Communications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eileen has done us busy people an enormous service with Ease. It is quite one thing to know what the neuroscience and positive psychology research says about dealing with times of crazy busy, but quite another to apply the strategies to our own lives. Eileen bridges both and lays out a smorgasbord of solid ideas that are easy to grasp and to customize to ones own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
