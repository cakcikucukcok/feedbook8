      <meta name="description" content="Like most kids, Axel Matson assumed that turning sixteen means a drivers license, getting his first job, and a lot more freedom. That all changes when his grandfather comes to town. 
All his life his grandfather has been telling Axel stories of monsters that once lived side-by-side with humans. But after Axel gets his birthday present, he starts to realize that maybe there was some truth to those bedtime stories. 
Slik, a wise-cracking monster made out of liquid metal, has been asleep for hundreds of years. Now, he and Axel must join together as they fight their way through werewolves, harpies, and evil sorcerers hell-bent on getting their hands on Slik. Together along with Axels best friend, Richie, and a gorgeous, but crazy, girl with an electrifying personality, they set out for a school in New Mexico. 
But will they be able to survive the monsters chasing them? Or each other for that matter?" />
