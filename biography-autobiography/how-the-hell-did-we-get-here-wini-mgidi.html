  <title>How the Hell Did We Get Here? - Wini Mgidi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do not be deceived: racism is still brewing in South Africa. The author shares about how she experienced firsthand rejection when she fell in love with a white man. In spite of being a sought after career woman, she was unequivocally rejected because of the colour of her skin. When love fi nds a grown up black village girl and white farm boy, nothing can be the same again. The seemingly unlikely online connection transforms their lives, that of their children and the unborn generations within them. The tone is honest. The author dares to ask questions that are often sidetracked and raises the alarm. Her unpretentious pitch is most captivating and allows for the reader to connect with her. She uses some of her most intimate and discreet encounters to relay a story that is not a story at all. 
If you found an open journal would you read it?
Greatness resides within you. Dont wait for others to acknowledge it.
Recognize it and run with it!
(Wini Mgidi)
Only a few people could guess that the prominent woman, standing accomplished and still soaring today, came from the humble, ashy streets of rural Mpumalanga. Her less privileged past is the very same thing that gives her hope and confidence. Ambitious and determined to grasp whatever she sets her mind into, she is a young, well-travelled person with visions not only set on international benchmarks but are often surpassed by her inner drive and relentless pursuit to see them materialise before her." />
