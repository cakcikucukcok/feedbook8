  <title>Bad Moon Over Alpine - David D. Ferman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two 50ish ex-Marines, once best friends, reunite to solve six serial murders of young businessmen from the plush mountain ski village of Alpine, Colorado. Charlie Holoman is the Chief of Police who believes that his old friend, Gordy Tyler, has a high-tech computerized Query System Program that can organize and sort out the daunting pile of unconsolidated data to help solve these serial murders. Recently widowed, Gordy becomes unintentionally involved with one of Charlie&amp;rsquo;s female police officers, Beth Brennan, whose former bad-boy brother, Al, becomes one of the principal suspects as the serial murderer.&lt;br /&gt;
While looking for Al in the mountains, Gordy witnesses another murder. Gordy chases the unknown killer to Ashcroft, a ghost town, under an unusual &amp;ldquo;bad moon.&amp;rdquo; After several pitched but uneven gun battles, Gordy shoots the killer through an old wooden wall with his .44-calibre magnum revolver, who dies in a flurry of his own rifle fire. As Gordy approaches the killer&amp;rsquo;s body to identify it, Beth moves her shotgun in Gordy&amp;rsquo;s general direction because she is thinking that the dead body may be her brother. However, the dead killer is his lifelong friend, Charlie Holoman.&lt;br /&gt;
This story is too complex to describe in a summary description. For a more comprehensive quick-look overview, please read my enclosed outline.&lt;/p&gt;" />
