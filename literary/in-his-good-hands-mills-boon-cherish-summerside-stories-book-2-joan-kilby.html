          &lt;strong&gt;Renita Thatcher never imagined she&#39;d see Brett O&#39;Connor in town again - let alone in her office.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Renita has only caught glimpses of her old crush in the tabloids as Brett jet-set his way to football superstardom.Oh, who&#39;s she trying to kid? She&#39;d followed his career religiously. And his marriage to the gorgeous, high-profile trophy wife. Ex -wife.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Renita, the only loans officer in Summerside Bay, has something Brett wants. Just like in high school, she&#39;s in a position of power over him, but this time, she doesn&#39;t want to mess it up. Her next move is critical. Does she want revenge or does she want to surrender herself to a guy who looks even better than her best fantasy?&lt;/p&gt;
