  <title>Truly, Madly, Deeply (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Elizabeth August</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A WILLING WIFE?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sweet-natured Minerva Brodwick knew that Judd Graham would stop at nothing to protect his beloved little brood, but never had she imagined the protective father would go so far as to propose a marriage of convenience! Falling for his adorable little angels came naturally to the nanny-turned-newlywed…. Unfortunately, so did falling for their irresistable father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Judd popped the question, he assumed he was immune to his blushing bride&#39;s charm. After all, he had vowed never to give his heart again. But every time he caught Minerva gazing up at him with such starry-eyed wonder, he felt compelled to make her his in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; way. Could this gruffly tender family man actually be falling truly, madly, deeply in love?&lt;/p&gt;
