  <title>Everest 1951 - Eric Shipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Mount Everest. They climbed from the south, from Nepal, via the Khumbu Glacier - a route first pioneered in 1951 by a reconnaissance expedition led by Eric Shipton. Everest 1951 is the account of this expedition. It was the first to approach the mountain from the south side, it pioneered a route through the Khumbu icefall and it was the expedition on which Hillary set foot on Everest for the first time. Everest 1951 is a short but vitally important read for anybody with any interest in mountaineering or in Everest. The 1951 Everest Expedition marked the public highpoint of Shipton&#39;s mountaineering fame. Key information was discovered and the foundations laid for future success. Despite this, Shipton&#39;s critics felt he had a &#39;lack of trust&#39; and thus failed to match the urgent mood of the period. Despite having been on more Everest expeditions than any man alive, he was &#39;eased&#39; out of the crucial leadership role in 1953 and so missed the huge public acclaim given to Hillary, Tenzing Norgay and John Hunt after their historic success." />
