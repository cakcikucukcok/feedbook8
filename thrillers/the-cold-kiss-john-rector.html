  <title>The Cold Kiss - John Rector</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All Nate and Sara want is a new life in a new town, away from the crime and poverty of their past.  So, after being approached at a roadside diner by a man offering $500 for a ride to Omaha, they wonder if their luck might be changing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first it seems like easy money, but within a few hours the man is dead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, forced off the road by a blizzard and trapped in a run-down motel on the side of a deserted highway, Nate and Sara begin to uncover the man&#39;s secrets. Who he was, how he died, and most importantly, why he was carrying two million dollars in his suitcase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before they know it, Nate and Sara are fighting for their lives, and in the end, each has to decide just how far they are willing to go to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cold Kiss&lt;/i&gt; is an everyman psychological thriller that pits a young couple against moral corruption, greed, betrayal, and love. More simply, for two characters who may have used up all their chances, it&#39;s the classic final trip down the dark tunnel that might lead to heaven, but drags them through hell.  This is &lt;i&gt;A Simple Plan&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Getaway,&lt;/i&gt; with a pulse-pounding plot and a twist ending.  John Rector is name that all thriller fans will come to know and love for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
