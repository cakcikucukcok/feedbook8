  <title>Too Soon Old-Too Late Smart - Alana L. Lilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After repeating the same mistakes over and over again, author Alana L. Lilly often thinks, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me, and when am I going to learn?&quot; Through one horrible relationship after another, Lilly swore to never make bad decisions again. But like many women, she still kept moving from one dysfunctional relationship to the next. Then, something miraculous happened.&lt;/p&gt;
Has God ever spoken to you-literally reached out and grabbed your attention? People don&#39;t believe that this happens today; and at first, neither did Lilly. Like a small drip from a faucet that will not let up-with the constant drip-drip-drip that threatens to drive you nuts-she tried to ignore the persistent thought that God wanted her to write a book. But it didn&#39;t work. With His help, and guidance from the Holy Spirit, Lilly eventually trusts in the Lord&#39;s imploration to lend her story to those who might share in its message.&lt;/p&gt;
All females face adversities, hardships, and trials. Life is hard-but turning your back on friends, family, and the ones you love is never the answer. So find a comfortable place to sit and relax, and let Lilly tell you her inspirational story &lt;/p&gt;" />
