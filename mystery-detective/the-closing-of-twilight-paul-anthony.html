  <title>The Closing of Twilight - Paul Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Closing of Twilight
When Kraylen Somersett is paid a small fortune in lieu of journeying to the south to find a missing child, he has no idea of what he is about to discover once he steps through the gates of Lindham Manor.
From the moment Lady Louisa Lindham informs him that only he can find her grandson Coren, his suspicious nature heightens.  
The first night Kraylen hears the cry of the Abiding, he knows it represents more than the mere wail of a wild animal.  Somehow, it links him directly to whatever is happening inside the manor.  
What he doesnt realize is that each night when the Abiding cries out, it draws him closer on an unparalleled emotional level.  Its wail takes him to the depths of a state of melancholy, one he has never known possible whilst bringing about the question, why is no one else at the Manor affected by the creatures cry?  
With the help of Lady Louisas granddaughter, Carina, he ventures through the hidden corridors by way of the panel at the back of his bedroom closet.  It is while on their search that he discovers a diary written nearly 300 years earlier.  
He later learns that the diary was written by his very own ancestor, Thomas Casor, who was deeply in love with Anastasia, the daughter of Charles Lindham.  
It becomes a race against time and a life-altering decision for Kraylen to connect the past with the present to find the true meaning behind Corens disappearance by the seventh day of the seventh month when he will finally understand the meaning of the closing of twilight." />
