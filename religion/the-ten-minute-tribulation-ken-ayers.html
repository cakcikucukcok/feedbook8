  <title>The Ten Minute Tribulation - Ken Ayers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By law you will need a seatbelt to read this book, but, by the grace of Jesus Christ, you can leave it off!
With all of the end time talk these days it can almost make you want to give up.  Maybe it&#39;s time to stop listening to what everyone is saying and see what the Word of God has been saying without contradiction for thousands of years.  Inside this book we will take a step by step walk through the windows of time and learn why many predictions that have been made were never even possible to take place until now.  With scripture after scripture you will see where we are on God&#39;s Clock and be able to stand firm on God&#39;s Word and NOT be shaken by others opinions ever again.  I feel certain that even many believers will find this information astonishing and after a close study of the scriptures they will know that only a True and Living God could have provided His People with such an accurate road map in time.  
 Amos 3:7 Suerly the LORD God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets.
Ken Ayers grew up in Charles County Maryland durring a time when it was quite different than what it is today.  Although for many years he had no relationship with the LORD and lived a life that was far from that of a Christian, when the time was right he found that the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob is still faithful to answer all of those that will call on His Name in their time of need. 
Psalm 34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
May the LORD bless you and keep you!
