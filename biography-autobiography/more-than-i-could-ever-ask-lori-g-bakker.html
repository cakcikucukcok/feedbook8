  <title>More Than I Could Ever Ask - Lori G. Bakker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meeting Lori Bakker today-a young woman with a bright, outgoing personality, you could hardly imagine her as a teenager living a life of flagrant sexual promiscuity and drug abuse. Nor would you picture her as having had five abortions before she was twenty-one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Than I Could Ever Ask&lt;/i&gt; tugs at the heartstrings of women and men. Lori&#39;s story is one of forgiveness-finding forgiveness from God, learning to forgive the men who hurt her, and most of all, discovering inner peace. Her story also shows the power of love and faithfulness. After she was single and celibate for nearly nine years, Lori met and fell in love with a man she had known only by reputation-Jim Bakker. Today Lori and Jim-two broken lives brought together by God as one-have been restored and are busy helping restore others to spiritual and emotional wholeness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
