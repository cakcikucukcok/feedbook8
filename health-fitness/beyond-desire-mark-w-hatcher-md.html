  <title>Beyond Desire - Mark W. Hatcher Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The past few decades have seen remarkable technological growth in the delivery of modern medicine. Pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and surgical interventions have transformed the way in which health is perceived and medicine is practiced. The modern patient has become so dependent upon these therapies and interventions that they take a passive interest in their health. For author Dr. Mark W. Hatcher, this is a symptom of a culture in crisisdoctors treat disease instead of fostering health.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using real-life examples from a busy emergency room, he investigates this health-care crisis and reevaluates what it means to be healthy. In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Desire: Rediscovering Health and Wellness&lt;/i&gt;, Hatcher examines the assumptions upon which the modern medical world is founded, explores the healing methods that have been practiced for centuries by healers around the world, and proposes a strategy for health that focuses on the importance of the mind and spirit in achieving and maintaining health.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beyond Desire&lt;/i&gt; shows how the practices of meditation, yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, proper eating, and selfless service are the true pathways to healing and rediscovering health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
