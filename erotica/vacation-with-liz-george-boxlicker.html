  <title>Vacation With Liz - George Boxlicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liz, one of my sexiest lady friends, has won a trip to Hawaii and wants me to accompany her. She has a fantasy, and believes I can help it come true better than anyone else. I play my part for her, and she experiences romance in the tropical paradise. Because of the graphic descriptions of our last night, this book is for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I see we&amp;#39;re going to be seatmates,&amp;rdquo; I said, by way of beginning introductions. &amp;quot;This is a long flight, so I might as well introduce myself. My name is George Boxlicker, but there&amp;#39;s no reason to be formal. Just call me George.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Glad to meet you, George,&amp;rdquo; she responded, offering her hand. &amp;quot;My name is Liz.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
As I shook her hand, I asked &amp;quot;Is that short for Elizabeth?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, but I don&amp;#39;t like the long form because some people used to call me &amp;lsquo;Lizard Breath,&amp;rsquo; almost as much as I dislike being called Lizzie. It makes me think of Lizzie Borden.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay. Since I don&amp;#39;t want you taking an axe to me, I won&amp;#39;t call you Lizzie. Did you know Elizabeth has more nicknames than just about any other woman&amp;#39;s name? I had a great aunt named Elizabeth and everybody called her Bid or Aunt Bid.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That sounds better than Lizzie. Or better than Elizabeth.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
All through the flight, we chatted amiably or read magazines or looked out the window at nothing. I also sneaked an occasional look at Liz, which is what I would have done if she had actually been a stranger, because she is very easy to look at. Although she says she&amp;rsquo;s overweight, I have always told her she has a great figure, especially her breasts, that I was aware are size 38D. Besides her sexy form, my friend has a pretty face, with long, soft red hair, fair skin and a pleasantly attractive face with a great smile. All together, a very good-looking woman, besides having a sweet disposition.&lt;br /&gt;
During the course of our conversation, shortly before landing, I happened to mention the name of the hotel where I would be staying in Hawaii. Liz thought that was a remarkable coincidence, that we were seatmates and that we would be staying at the same hotel. &amp;quot;What are the odds?&amp;rdquo; she asked. Then she went on to point out that, as part of the contest prize, she was entitled to a rental car, and that she would be picking it up at the airport. &amp;quot;You seem like a nice guy. Since we are both going to the same place, how about a ride to the hotel? You can help me get my carryon luggage out of the overhead compartment and then help me put my stuff in the car trunk.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, Liz, that seems like a good idea. You seem to be a bit of alright yourself, as the British might say, and my plans aren&amp;#39;t really set. I will probably be getting my own car tomorrow but, for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll accept your offer. But, in exchange, you have to let me buy you dinner tonight, unless you have other plans or are meeting someone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, George, I&amp;#39;m not meeting anybody and I don&amp;#39;t have any plans for dinner tonight. Thanks for the offer. That&amp;#39;s nice of you. I don&amp;#39;t really like eating alone, anyhow.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
At the car rental stand, the clerk saw Liz and me together and tried to rent the car to me. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t look at me,&amp;rdquo; I told him. &amp;ldquo;The lady here is your renter. I&amp;#39;m just bumming a ride.&amp;quot;" />
