  <title>The Bluewater Wraith - T.R. Boone&#39;s Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lacy and David Taylor buy a houseboat at a charity auction, although neither of them knows the first thing about boating. Lacy feels that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;ll be a brand new adventure for us &amp;ndash; owning a boat. We&amp;#39;ll have a wonderful time.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they find a harbor to moor their boat, they also meet the boat&amp;#39;s previous owner and his new wife, Frank and J.J. Patterson. The four of them soon become fast friends, even though Lacy is a little concerned about the attraction between her husband and the previous owner&amp;#39;s new wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they learn about their boat and the harbor they&amp;#39;re in, Lacy and David also learn something else: their boat is haunted, and their lives are in jeopardy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&amp;quot;A ghost haunting the claustrophobic confines of a houseboat is a frightening idea...and Sullivan writes well enough to make sure you believe it.&amp;quot; (aBumpInTheNight review)" />
