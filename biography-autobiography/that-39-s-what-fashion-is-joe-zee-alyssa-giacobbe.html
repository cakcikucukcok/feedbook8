      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joe Zee, the Editor in Chief of Yahoo Style, former creative director of &lt;i&gt;ELLE &lt;/i&gt;magazine, and co-host of the new ABC talk show &lt;i&gt;FAB Life&lt;/i&gt;, takes readers behind the scenes of the crazy and wonderful world of fashion in &lt;i&gt;That&#39;s What Fashion Is&lt;/i&gt;, packed with never-before-seen color photographs from Joe&#39;s personal collection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his early years styling shoots for &lt;i&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s &quot;Hollywood&quot; issue with famed photographer Annie Leibovitz to his role playing himself on MTV&#39;s reality show &lt;i&gt;The City&lt;/i&gt; to making celebrities look fabulous in the pages of &lt;i&gt;ELLE &lt;/i&gt;and reporting live from the red carpet. Joe lets readers in on how the fashion industry &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;works,   from the fashion disasters to the blockbuster successes.
