  <title>Shatter the Darkness - Mark Henry Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Easy Street, USA.  Tricia Gleason figures it originated in Frisco, Colorado.  No fuss, no sweat, no worry: the combination for a smooth summer.  All set to be a summer intern minister following her first seminary year, she would not be challenged as she was to read Sunday worship scripture, teach church youth to fly-cast and visit hospitals when asked.
That changed with one sentence, Tricia, forgot to tell you, but my wife and I are leaving Frisco for the summer; youre in charge.  She could only stare.   You cant be serious.  
The minister was.
Before she could think or count to ten Tricia is THE SUMMER MINISTER IN FRISCO, COLORADOto preach each Sunday, to coordinate all church activities and handle any surprise events.  She wonders if she and her fly rod will ever have a relationship.
The surprises are like fire-crackers exploding.  Happens fasta church college student is arrested for armed robbery of a 7/11, is harassed at his university and then disappears.  A couple in the church are found, deader than dead according to the county sheriff.  Figures it is murder/suicide.  Church members rant Tricia only works three hours a week on Sunday morningscan never find her during the week.   The minister comes back earlier than he said, but not to take over.  Comes back to defend sexual misconduct charges.  And, as Tricia learns, that isnt even a glimpse into other ways of ministry.
The county sheriff and detective ask her help.  They know she has solved murders before.  Shed rather put on a fishing hat but it doesnt happen enough.  Soon discovers no suicide but a double-murder.  Tricia has hunches but they are a cul-de-sac, leading in circles.    
When the who murdered this couple is learned, down deep Tricia isnt sure.  And then, the one arrested  states, Do you think I did this by myself?  Well, folks, guess again.
Tricia thought it was musing about another.  She was wrong.  So wrong.
And, in it all she never finds Easy Street in Frisco, Colorado." />
