  <title>Physics of Cancer - Professor Claudia Tanja Mierke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Understanding the physical aspects of cancer cell behaviour is shedding new light on how cancer forms and spreads, and offers new approaches to the development of novel treatments though recognizing the physical parameters that control how cancer cells grow, evolve and spread around the body. &lt;BR&gt;Physics of Cancer focuses on the mechanical properties of cancer cells and their role in cancer disease and metastasis. It discusses the role of the mechanical properties of interacting cells and the connective tissue microenvironment and describes the role of an inflammation during cancer disease. This outstanding book is the first to describe cancer disease from a biophysical point of view without being incomplete in describing the biological site of cancer. The author combines the biochemical, medical, cell biological and physical views of cancer by highlighting the importance of the mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment. &lt;BR&gt;This book is written for scientists and everyone interested in the rapidly growing field of physics of cancer. It connects and discusses researchers? findings from different fields and points out the importance of the mechanical properties of cells for the understanding of cancer disease. With extensive references and further reading suggestions, it will further improve the knowledge of the reader and guide them through this complex and growing field of cancer research. Originating in part from the author?s own courses on tumor biology and cellular biophysics, this book is suitable for both students and researchers in this dynamic interdisciplinary field, be they from a physical, biological or medical sciences background. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
