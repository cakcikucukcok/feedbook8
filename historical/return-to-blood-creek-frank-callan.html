  <title>Return to Blood Creek - Frank Callan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Long Corral, Wyoming, the Kenny brothers dig themselves out of the town jail, but Deputy Ben Stile runs after them as they turn and shoot. At that moment Cal Roney, Pinkerton detective, is riding into town and takes a bullet meant for Stile. He goes down, wounded in the shoulder, and is nursed back to health by Emilia Stile and by Doc Dan Heath, who are standing firm against the Kenny brothers, who want to own everything in sight. But in his fever, Cal speaks his real name: one that strikes hatred into the hearts of everyone in Long Corral. Only Emilia hears the name, and she tells nobody. But can his secret be kept?  When he recovers, Cal vows to help Doc Heath in his struggle to keep the town free of the Kenny gang. But Cal&#39;s secret past catches up with him, leading to a final showdown at Blood Creek." />
