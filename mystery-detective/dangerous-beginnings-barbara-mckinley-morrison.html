  <title>Dangerous Beginnings - Barbara McKinley Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Susan OBrien Shaw is a lonely widow in need of a change. After a three-year absence, she decides to leave Canada and return to the small Mexican town of Bucerias to rekindle some happy memories. As always, she takes her dog, Princess, with her. However, things in Bucerias are not exactly as Susan rememberedor hoped.
&lt;p&gt;
    As soon as she arrives, an attractive, silver-haired man attempts to steal her suitcase. Next, her apartment gets ransacked and her purse stolen. It seems Susan has become a target, and she has no idea why. She comes upon a young orphan boy named Rat, who lives in a dump. Feeling down in the dumps herself,
    she befriends him.
&lt;p&gt;
    Soon, both their lives are threatened, and in order to stay alive, they are forced to investigate. They realize the Mexican police cannot be trusted, so with the help of friends, they take matters into their own hands. Susan was looking for a change. In Bucerias, she finds counterfeit drugs, danger, and even love. Heres hoping she gets out alive.
&lt;/p&gt;

   What readers are saying about this novel!
&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Just finished your novel, Dangerous Beginnings, wow, what a page turner, could not put it down. Did very little today, sitting in the sun enjoying your wonderful way with words, well done. I would recommend this book to everyone. Congrats on your first publication!&quot;  Davine Felotick
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Dangerous Beginnings, is a wonderfully written, easy to read novel, that I totally enjoyed.
 This has a different twist to it, as the &quot;crime&quot; is something most of us do not know about but, it is, on every level, a true and haunting one. Not just for Mexico but for hundreds of countries.
 I felt as if I was going back with you to a Mexico I remember. I sensed that heat as you step off the plane, the culture, the romance and the very idea of beginning again with Susan&#39;s every word.
 I wish you much luck and good fortune with this book, and can not wait to hear more tales of Susan, Rat and now, Miguel. 
 Do yourselves a favour, por favor, mi amigas, and beg, buy or borrow this book! Lynda Curlette

&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Just got done with Dangerous Beginnings! It was a great read, and it kept me turning pages till the very end. (If I&#39;m tired today, it&#39;s because once I started reading, I didn&#39;t stop till I finished the whole thing lol) I wish you the best of luck at your upcoming signings. Congratulations on a very fine book! Such a lovely setting for a story, and I felt like I knew the characters.&quot; Joyce Zikursh
