  <title>The Accidental Empire - Gershom Gorenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The untold story, based on groundbreaking original research, of the actions and inactions that created the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;     After Israeli troops defeated the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in June 1967, the Jewish state seemed to have reached the pinnacle of success. But far from being a happy ending, the Six-Day War proved to be the opening act of a complex political drama, in which the central issue became: Should Jews build settlements in the territories taken in that war?&lt;br&gt;     &lt;b&gt;The Accidental Empire&lt;/b&gt; is Gershom Gorenberg&#39;s masterful and gripping account of the strange birth of the settler movement, which was the child of both Labor Party socialism and religious extremism. It is a dramatic story featuring the giants of Israeli history--Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir, Levi Eshkol, Yigal Allon--as well as more contemporary figures like Ariel Sharon, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres. Gorenberg also shows how the Johnson, Nixon, and Ford administrations turned a blind eye to what was happening in the territories, and reveals their strategic reasons for doing so.&lt;br&gt;     Drawing on newly opened archives and extensive interviews, Gorenberg reconstructs what the top officials knew and when they knew it, while weaving in the dramatic first-person accounts of the settlers themselves. Fast-moving and penetrating, &lt;i&gt;The Accidental Empire&lt;/i&gt; casts the entire enterprise in a new and controversial light, calling into question much of what we think we know about this issue that continues to haunt the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;" />
