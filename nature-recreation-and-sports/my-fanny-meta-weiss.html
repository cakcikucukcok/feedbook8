  <title>My Fanny - Meta Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This charming little book may not qualify as a mystery, but its title seems intriguing enough to unravel the vagueness behind it. It is a great tool to wipe away the ills of the world in a single afternoon. It will make you chuckle and sometimes laugh aloud as the story unwinds, but there are also moments of sadness, because it is indeed a real-life story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the title like My Fanny, you may wonder if the story is about a long-lost, true love or a girl in a white dress and polished shoes going to her first communion. Or is it a mischievous tomboy hiding behind this innocenceor worse? Could a demon hide behind such sweetness? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely is not about the fanny that is part of the body, which one normally refers to as derriere or buttocks. In most cases, that subject would not warrant enough material to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little treasure hidden where you least expect it. Its value and its uses are immeasurable. It is an easy read for youngsters from six to ninety-six. Best of all, it is a heartwarming, delightful interaction of mixed company. The illustrations give credence to the truth of this wonderful tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I am sure you will encounter total relaxation and pleasure by the time you finish the last page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
