  <title>Stained Glass - Janet Hanna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When we think of God, we automatically tend to think of Him in a couple of extremes. He is either some nebulous power that pops up every now and then, or some sort of wild control freak wiping out nations, causing hurricanes, and ruining fun. This book will hopefully show the reader a picture of Gods intimate and absolute communion with mankind. The stories deal with themes not commonly associated with the Almighty. In this book Jesus walks on water, but not on people. He smiles on success, but not sin. His favor falls on the most unsuspecting, and most of the time we never suspect it could be us. The stories and poems raise questions, spirits, hopes, and sometimes eyebrows. Author Janet Hanna hopes that, as you read this book, you will know there is a God. He rolls up His sleeves and goes to work shutting things, holding off on things, saying yes to this and no to that. He is closing doors but opening windowswindows of stained glass.&lt;/p&gt;" />
