  <title>The Attenbury Emeralds - Jill Paton Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1936, Dorothy L. Sayers abandoned the last Lord Peter Wimsey detective story. Sixty years later, a brown paper parcel containing a copy of the manuscript was discovered in her agent&#39;s safe in London, and award-winning novelist Jill Paton Walsh was commissioned to complete it. The result of the pairing of Dorothy L. Sayers with Walsh was the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;Thrones, Dominations. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Now, following &lt;i&gt;A Presumption of Death&lt;/i&gt;, set during World War II, comes a new Sayers-inspired mystery featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, revisiting his very first case. . . . It was 1921 when Lord Peter Wimsey first encountered the Attenbury Emeralds. The recovery of the gems in Lord Attenbury&#39;s dazzling heirloom collection made headlines--and launched a shell-shocked young aristocrat on his career as a detective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty years later, a happily married Lord Peter has just shared the secrets of that mystery with his wife, the detective novelist Harriet Vane. Suddenly, the new Lord Attenbury--grandson of Lord Peter&#39;s first client--seeks his help to prove who owns the emeralds. As Harriet and Peter contemplate the changes that the war has wrought on English society--and Peter, who always cherished the liberties of a younger son, faces the unwanted prospect of ending up the Duke of Denver after all--Jill Paton Walsh brings us a masterful new chapter in the annals of one of the greatest detectives of all time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
