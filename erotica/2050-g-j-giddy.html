  <title>2050 - G.J Giddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2050. Most of the Western World was in a state of unrest. Fossil fuels finally became almost nonexistent; the much-hyped alternative power such as solar, wind, and tidal barely kept the countries going. Australia is a republic cutting all ties with England. England continued rearranging the new Kingdom; they banished Sundays, ousted the royals, then divided all cities into twofirst class citizens one side of the fence and second class on the other side.
Caught up in all of this in his beloved country, Australia, George and his wife, Elizabeth, considered they are lucky to be selected from a worldwide advertisement for a computer analyst. On arriving in London, George was slowly noticing the former United Kingdom, now called the Kingdom, was on the same footing as Australia, if not worse.
Settling into work, George takes interest in an unauthorised site; this site will eventually turn his life and Elizabeths into a nightmare. George, facing certain death as he is hunted, disguises himself as an Afghani refugee. In this awkward position, George still manages to download this site as Elizabeth and Georges ex-boss, Henrik, search high and low for him.
Henrik eventually finds his whereabouts; George once again changes back into normal street clothes to try and avoid certain death. This time, George is saved by a rebel leader of second-class citizens rebellion named Sky Blue. George joins forces. George is faced with another battle: Sky Blues sexual advances and his love for Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, now in the same position as George, finds herself on the other side of the barrier. Daily, she searches for George while sharing an apartment with several working girls. As time goes by, Elizabeth accepts being a second-class citizen. This leads her to become a well-known vaudeville performer on stage and very handy with her hands backstage.
As the revolution nears, George and Sky Blue encounter Georges ex-boss, Henrik. The multinational company is desperate to silence George and anyone else who knows the formula. George knows this secret to revitalise a permanent substitute to fossil fuels that will last as long as human beings remain on earth. To save himself from this nightmare, George takes shelter in the Canadian Embassy only to be deported back to Botany Bay on a prison container ship while Elizabeths search for George continues. 
God couldnt save the King; the new revolution party will." />
