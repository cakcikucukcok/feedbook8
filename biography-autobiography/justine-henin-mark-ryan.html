  <title>Justine Henin - Mark Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the best women tennis players of all time, Justine Henin&#39;s dazzling array of shots, combined with her immense personal courage, have earned her enormous respect among current players and former champions alike. Justine&#39;s success is all the more remarkable considering that off-court she has had to weather a series of family tragedies, a debilitating virus, the breakdown of her marriage and a seven-year feud with her father and brothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with family bridges rebuilt, her tennis is reaching new heights, to bring her one Grand Slam title after another. Always thrilling to watch, Justine&#39;s breathtaking backhand, described by John McEnroe as &#39;the best in the world - man or woman&#39; is rivalled by a sensational forehand and razor-sharp volleying. Author Mark Ryan, who has good relations with the Henin family, knows the inside story of Justine&#39;s rise to the top - and what it almost cost her - better than any other sports journalist. His account is compelling, sensitive and a must for all tennis-lovers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
