  <title>I Didn&#39;t Know That!!!!! - Marie-Josee Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marie-Jose Losier or MJ was born in Canada and has been involved in competitive sports since her early years. As a teenager, she ran track against the boys to improve her times (and theirs) and spent her summers on the golf course winning many regional golf tournaments.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Marie-Jose&#39;s passion for an active and healthy lifestyle led her to a degree in Nutrition at Moncton University in Canada. She then earned a Certificate in Education to enable her to share her knowledge with teenagers, (her favorite audience) by teaching health subjects in High Schools. She then worked several years for the International Pharmaceutical/Nutritional Company, Wyeth-Ayerst Inc., educating healthcare providers about various nutritional products.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
During those years, she continued her involvement in various sports, and for a period of eight years MJ became involved in Competitive Bodybuilding which saw her win both regional and provincial competitions in her weight division. She continued her pursuit of Bodybuilding, ultimately competing in the Canadian Bodybuilding Championship and finishing in the top five. This led to multiple appearances in major fitness magazines. Marie-Jose then joined the dynamic international nutraceutical company, Ocean Nutrition Canada Ltd., where she worked in many different fields, helping in the development of new innovative health products for companies such as Kraft, Kellogg, Archer Daniel Midland, Amway and Hills Pet Nutrition. During those years her passion for golf resurfaced, she polished her game to the point that she was able to compete at the Canadian Golf Championship.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
As a pianist and ardent lover of music, Marie-Jose studied &quot;The future of Music and Web Designing for Musicians&quot; with Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
MJ&#39;s diverse experiences over the years both in nutrition and competitive sports has positioned her to share her knowledge of healthy living with all those who yearn for a healthier lifestyle. It is her utmost desire to equip all those who desire a better lifestyle by sharing &quot;I Didn&#39;t Know That, 101 Q&amp;A To A Healthier Lifestyle&quot;, so that they too can live a long and healthy life." />
