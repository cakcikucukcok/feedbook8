  <title>An Element of Guilt - J. H. Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Accusations! Accusations! Nothing but accusations. Mr. Edwards paced up and down the length of his living room, his face drawn with a worried frown. Mr. Edwards was a middle-aged, medium built man and was widowed. He was speaking to his valet, Barney who watched his master with profound sympathy. Mr. Edwards did not consider him to be a servant any longer as he was trusted and honest and had been in his employ for quite some years and had often been of assistance in all his private work, business and personal affairs and had been extremely faithful. Barney was handsomely young with a broad face and brawn, unlike Mr. Edwards who looked frail and now his hair was getting white at the sides which marked the strain and worry he was going through. All his gleam and enchantment was lost from his countenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Edwards lived in a comfortable bungalow with a lawn and patches of flowers that filled the nostrils with a pleasant fragrance. The only occupants were his valet and himself. The sunbeams filtered through the window and gave a cheery appearance. It had not rained that morning. Barney sat motionless as he watched his master pace the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! What a world, this deceitful, disdainful sphere, Mr. Edwards exclaimed turning to Barney who now began to console his weary master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sire, be not aghast, your innocence will, eventually be proved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
