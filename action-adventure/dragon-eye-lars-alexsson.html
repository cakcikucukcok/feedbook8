  <title>Dragon Eye - Lars Alexsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How can a boy live a normal life when he is regarded as the son of a serial killer? For Hero Haitaka, a normal life is all he wants. After escaping the grip of Sekiha High School (a school for A class delinquents in Japan), Hero is given a chance to enroll in Kamina High School for his last years of high school, but there are just a few problems. 
The first problem is the constant attacks from Sekiha students who are after the title Hero took at Sekiha. Second is a girl named Rika Soto, known as the leader of the Slayers. The Slayers are Kamina Highs newspaper club members, who are dedicated to uncovering the truth of school scandals and students secrets if they can. Lets hope Hero can keep his secret a secret from the Slayers. 
Can Hero make it in this new school, or will the students of Sekiha High get him? And if they dont, will the Slayers destroy any chance of a normal life for him?" />
