  <title>The 50 Most Positive Things I Know About African Americans - Danny Ray Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I realize that with this book, I am like a voice crying in the wilderness, as everybody else is crying at the sad state of the black community and finding nothing good to say about us. I dare to believe and argue that we are still mighty people, with much to be proud of. So what I have done with this book is just talk about what I personally feel are the strong points of the black as people and community. You can choose to say that I am living in a fantasy world if you want. But I am confident that African Americans are going to eventually show the world that they are indeed a noble race and that they have much to offer society. History has proven that when things are at their worst is when the tide changes and victory is won. I strongly believe that we are on the verge of a breakthrough as far as our overcoming the problems that presently beset us. I want to show with this book that we are as capable as any other race of growing stronger from the obstacles we face and struggle with. These hard times are ultimately going to make us stronger and give us a hell of a story to tell our grandchildren and write in the history books for future generations to read." />
