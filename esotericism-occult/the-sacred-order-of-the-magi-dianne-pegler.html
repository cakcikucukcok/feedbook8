  <title>The Sacred Order of the Magi - Dianne Pegler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The true story of the Three Wise Men of the Christmas Nativity Story has remained a secret for over two thousand years.
The Three Wise Men are the founder members of the very Sacred Order of the Magi. The Order has survived for two thousand years much the same as the Ancient Orders of Stonemasons and the Knights Templar. Unlike those orders, however, it has remained a secretuntil now. 
Members of the Sacred Order of the Magi have worked on their own or in small groups, with some members never knowing others. For certain families, it was a dynasty that encompassed some but not all family members. 
The vow that all members of the Sacred Order of the Magi take is to uphold in their hearts and souls the truth of Jesus mission. 
Why was the order kept a secret? Why is the story of the Three Wise Men and their Sacred Order being disclosed now? 
You will read how the Three Wise Men of love and light with unrelenting integrity, bravery, and overwhelming sadness discover the role they are to play in Jesus destiny. For his sake and safety and for the salvation of our planet, the Sacred Order of the Magi went undercover and became the Spiritual Security Service. 
Now is the time to reveal its existence. Now is the time to disclose many sacred truths. It was ordained to be so. Now is the time of the second coming of Jesus, or Yeshua Ben Joseph, as he was known to the Magi.
The story of The Three Wise Men is not solely for Christmas; it is for all time." />
