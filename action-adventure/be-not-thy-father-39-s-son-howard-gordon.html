  <title>Be Not Thy Father&#39;s Son - Howard Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Trace the exciting adventures of Mark Engler as he takes you on an historic adventure that spans both the ages and all four corners of the Earth.  &lt;br&gt;In the traditions of James Michener and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Howard Gordon neatly combines history, psychology, sex, adventure and intrigue into one delightful saga that prom-ises to become one of the masterpieces of great world literature for all time.   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Howard Gordon, born and raised in Ohio, has attended Ohio University and Ohio State University. He obtained a master&#39;s degree in the field of social work from Case Western Reserve University and has worked in a varied number of capacities within the field for over forty years. &lt;i&gt;Be Not Thy Father&#39;s Son&lt;/i&gt; was written over a five-year period and stresses that we must be our own person in a growing bureaucratic network that is destructive to individuality. Howard has also recently completed his second novel entitled &lt;i&gt;Cry Heaven, Cry Hell&lt;/i&gt; which raises the question of how far do we go, as a society, in forgiving evil works when they are followed by good works and constructive behavior. He is currently working on his third novel." />
