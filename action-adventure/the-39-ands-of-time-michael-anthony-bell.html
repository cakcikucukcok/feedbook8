  <title>The &#39;Ands of Time - Michael Anthony Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story is based partially in the island of Jamaica and in America. It traces the life of a family from the 1970s into the future and explores the relationship between individual behaviour, greed, selfishness, societal violence, organized crime, tribalism, gang and urban warfare, science and genetics as a consequence of the impact of the global village and ambitions of geo-politics and world domination.
It explores how the thirst and thrust for world domination impacts on the lives and relationship of the family, and their neighbours, and how these factors affects individuals actions which in turn affect the collective consciousness of a nation and lead to murder, mayhem, and social degradation. It explores the reactive and dangerous steps taken by members of this family in order to survive.
Though informative and instructive, the book is a fast paced action pack story with lots of unexpected turns and developments as it builds up the reader with adrenaline paced narrative. You never quite know what is coming next.
The story, though fictionalized, is predicated and inspired by true events, the composite of lives of real persons and the extrapolation of cause, effects, conscience, and consequences. It examines how the attitude and actions of individuals on each other can affect these individual and impacts on the wider society and the world far into the future with multiplying effects. It also looks at the role that science, religion, nuclear proliferation, and politics will play in the future world.
Some of the names, locations, persons, and situations were changed, altered, and fictionalized in order to conceal the identity of some of the persons and characters, places, and to also add dramatic effect and to magnify and illustrate pertinent points and ideas." />
