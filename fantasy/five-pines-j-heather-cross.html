  <title>Five Pines - J. Heather Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine what your world would be like if you could see the hidden events of other peoples experiences as easily as you recall your own. Imagine being able to remember past lives with people youve just met. Imagine being able to feel their emotions, hear every unkind thought, feel every moment of deceit, know every lie Imagine being able to perceive the swirling energies of life as powerfully as a physical blow, yet be able to heal others with a focused touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine how it could consume you. How easily this double-edged gift of sensitivity could shape you; disrupting friendships and alienating lovers; turning you inwards to seek a fragile balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine how difficult it could be. How lonely. How dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine falling in love in a tumultuous chaos of wealth, poverty, Spiritual purity, magic, life, death, betrayal and corporate intrigue, nestled in the heart of a Native American family on the South Dakota prairie. Imagine hot nights of wildly transformational sex, where spirit and body seek union with a total disregard for social convention; knowing only the blinding, carnal need to reach for more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A life-altering account of love, metaphysical wisdom, transformation and loss based on the true life experiences of one such woman.&lt;/p&gt;
