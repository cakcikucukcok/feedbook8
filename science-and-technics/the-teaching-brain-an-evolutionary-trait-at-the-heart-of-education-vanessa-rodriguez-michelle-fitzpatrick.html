  <title>The Teaching Brain: An Evolutionary Trait at the Heart of Education - Vanessa Rodriguez, Michelle Fitzpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;What is at work in the mind of a five-year-old explaining the game of tag to a new friend? What is going on in the head of a thirty-five-year-old parent showing a first-grader how to button a coat? And what exactly is happening in the brain of a sixty-five-year-old professor discussing statistics with a room full of graduate students?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While research about the nature and science of learning abounds, shockingly few insights into how and why humans teach have emerged&amp;#151;until now. Countering the dated yet widely held presumption that teaching is simply the transfer of knowledge from one person to another, &lt;I&gt;The Teaching Brain&lt;/I&gt; weaves together scientific research and real-life examples to show that teaching is a dynamic interaction and an evolutionary cognitive skill that develops from birth to adulthood. With engaging, accessible prose, Harvard researcher Vanessa Rodriguez reveals what it &lt;I&gt;actually&lt;/I&gt; takes to become an expert teacher. At a time when all sides of the teaching debate tirelessly seek to define good teaching&amp;#151;or even how to build a better teacher&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;The Teaching Brain&lt;/I&gt; upends the misguided premises for how we measure the success of teachers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This game-changing analysis of how the mind teaches will transform common perceptions of one of the most essential human practices (and one of the most hotly debated professions), charting a path forward for teachers, parents, and anyone seeking to better understand learning&amp;#151;and unlocking the teaching brain in all of us.&lt;/div&gt;" />
