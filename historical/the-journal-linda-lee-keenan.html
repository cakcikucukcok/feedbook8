  <title>The Journal - Linda Lee Keenan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Manhattan is a treasure trove of history and culture, especially in and around Central Park. Julia Hamilton owns Hamilton Interiors and lives and works in the Big Apple.  She accepts an assignment to recreate a retail shop in a residential co-op on 5th Avenue for Mrs. Ellis Wellington.  Mrs. Wellington&#39;s antique shop in Germany was destroyed during Kristallnacht in 1939. To be authentic, the design must include an indoor fountain. That&#39;s when Julia discovers by unusual means what lies beneath the island of Manhattan.
While researching her royal Swedish heritage, Julia becomes interested in the life of Per (pronounced &quot;&quot;Pare&quot;&quot;)Lundgren, her great uncle who was a Swedish diplomat during the Second World War. She found that he joined forces with a German underground group in Berlin in 1940 and she begins writing a journal. 
She meets Thor Bjorn, seemingly by chance, and finds that he is privy to details of her private journal. Suddenly her life in 2015 is intertwined with her Uncle Per&#39;s life in Europe in 1940." />
