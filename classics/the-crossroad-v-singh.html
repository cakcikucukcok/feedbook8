  <title>The Crossroad - V Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Crossroad is an enduring and heart-wrenching story of loss and salvation, something that is straight from my heart. The idea had cropped up long back, and it took years for me to contemplate and craft the story, giving it the required meaning and purpose.  
The story is a work of fiction. This is my first attempt, and when I started writing, I never knew how it would begin and complete and that it would take such forbearing bends. The story defies chronological order of storytelling, merging into the haze of timelessness, delving further in an untried way of first voice, with recurrent narration in different time zones. 
I do not believe any of the events mentioned in the story has happened or is likely to happen. It is a story created around mysterious facts, lush interpretations, stark imaginations, and stalled dreams. Resemblance to anyone real, living, or dead may or may not be coincidental." />
