  <title>Cleek of Scotland Yard - Thomas W. Hanshew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hamilton Cleek is back - or is he?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Margot, Queen of the Apaches (the notorious French criminal gang) has been released on bail and vanished, Mr. Narkom has a series of inexplicable murders to solve, there is talk of revolution in Mauravania. And Cleek is missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hold on to your hats for another thrilling ride as spying, murder, horse-napping, bombs and political intrigue rear their ugly heads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas W. Hanshew (1857 &amp;ndash; 1914) was an American actor and writer, born in Brooklyn, N. Y. He went on the stage when only 16 years old, playing minor parts with Ellen Terry&amp;#39;s company. Subsequently he played important roles with Clara Morris and Adelaide Neilson. Later he was associated with a publishing house in London, where he resided at the close of his life. He used, among others, the pen name &amp;quot;Charlotte May Kingsley,&amp;quot; and wrote more than 150 novels, some of which were co-authored with his wife, Mary E. Hanshew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hanshew&amp;#39;s best-known creation was the consulting detective Hamilton Cleek, known as &amp;quot;the man of the forty faces&amp;quot; for his incredible skill at disguise. The central figure in dozens of short stories that began to appear in 1910 and were subsequently collected in a series of books, Cleek is based in Clarges Street, London, where he is constantly consulted by Inspector Narkom of Scotland Yard. Hamilton Cleek is laughably unrealistic, at least to the modern reader, not only for his ability to impersonate anyone but for his physical derring-do and his frequent melodramatic encounters with Margot, &amp;quot;Queen of the Apaches&amp;quot;, and her partner-in-crime Merode." />

He's also amazing, a fact I should mention as the author reminds it to us ad nauseum.<br /><b><i>Cleek Of Scotland Yard: Detective Stories by Thomas W. Hanshew</i></b> | The enigmatic Cleek, protagonist, is a sought-after consultant of Scotland Yard; he is of the gentry, but his origins a closely guarded secret: he is "just Cleek". The stories are spiced and threaded together by Cleeks's mortal enemies, the Apaches (the street gangs of Paris), by a love interest, and by the recurrent affairs of a fictitious Balkan monarchy.<br /><b><i>Cleek of Scotland Yard; Detective Stories: Hanshew, Thomas ...</i></b> | Hanshew's best-known creation was the consulting detective Hamilton Cleek, known as "the man of the forty faces" for his incredible skill at disguise.
