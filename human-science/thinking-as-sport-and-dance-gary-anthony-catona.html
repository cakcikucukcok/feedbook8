  <title>Thinking as Sport and Dance - Gary Anthony Catona</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This is what a philosophy book should be like-exciting, surprising, mind-opening,
honest, and original.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Alphonso Lingis, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, Pennsylvania State University&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Thinking as Sport and Dance&lt;/I&gt; will not only teach that real thinking is an amazing adventure into the greatest mysteries and experiences of life but will also reveal thinking as a grand celebration of life. &lt;p&gt;
To know the real glory of thinking, you must understand its two basic dimensions: the qualities that make it similar to sports and those that relate it to dance. Artful thinking is like a sport because it&#39;s goal-oriented, analytical, rule-bound, and confrontational. Besides pursuing knowledge with the attitude of a dedicated sportsperson, artful thinkers also engage reality in the spirit of dance, where thinking becomes spontaneous, intuitive, playful, and harmonious. &lt;p&gt;
Thinking at its best emerges when the mind of an athlete and that of a dancer live together competitively and playfully in the same mind. When this happens, beautiful thought performances result. &lt;I&gt;Thinking as Sport and Dance&lt;/I&gt; is a critical tool for addressing and resolving life&#39;s many complexities, as well as a guide to embracing life with gusto and joy." />
