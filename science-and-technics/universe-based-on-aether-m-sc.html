  <title>Universe  Based on Aether - M. Sc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Man has only begun to understand a few of the laws that govern the contents of this universe. So far, he has become aware of some of the contents of this universe, contents such as matter, anti-matter and energy. And, currently, he is guessing what some of its other contents such as dark matter, dark energy and vacuum energy may be, let alone the rest. Even though man is learning quickly, his knowledge regarding the formation of this universe and the development of its contents are still in their infancies. Therefore, he needs to have an open mind, as he is introduced to reasonable extensions of, or even detours to, his current understanding of different aspects of this physical world. 
Using his own newly proposed theories, the author is providing consistent explanations for a variety of fundamental phenomena such as time, light, space, energy , matter , gravity , electric field , magnetic field , electricity , black holes , dark matter , dark energy , vacuum energy . All of the theories presented are based on the existence of a compressible fluid aether medium in this universe. As it is clearly demonstrated, once the existence of such an aether medium is accepted and its effects are properly taken into account, many unresolved issues regarding this universe, including the current acceleration of its expansion, can be explained and readily understood. Even its birthplace can be identified. In other words, yes, the birthplace of this universe has been discovered." />
