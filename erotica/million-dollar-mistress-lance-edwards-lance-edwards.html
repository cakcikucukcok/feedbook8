  <title>Million Dollar Mistress -  Lance Edwards, Lance Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once again, Lady Lash, flamboyant adult film star and pre-eminent activist in promoting all things kink, is running a contest to find the new queen of domination through her website: degradatrix.com &quot;Offered live on pay-per-view TV and on-line streaming, &#39;A Celebration of Female Superiority&#39; will feature dominant and submissive couples competing to become this year&#39;s Mistress Degradatrix and Slave. The prize will be one million dollars and a weekly reality TV show based on the winners&#39; wonderfully exciting and wholly consensual relationship. ... Competition will involve four live onstage performances emphasizing each fundamental expression of the femdom lifestyle: display, restraint, discipline, and reward. Judging will be based on the scientifically determined level of male arousal combined with panel votes on female appeal, originality, stamina and their ability to dominate.&quot;  Chosen from the pool of applicants are newlyweds who already need to spice up their sex lives; D/s couples in to serious S&amp;M; a sub male who&#39;s just met his Mistress through an on-line ad; a dyke lesbian and her husband, dressed in his French maid costume; and, finally, the skilled dominatrix, Xenia, and her mute slave. As contestants compete before a live edition of &#39;Degradatrix,&#39; they take their submissive males to the limit of their endurance, showing off grueling measures of restraint, painful disciplinary technique, and humiliating subjugation. The competition is intense, and as the tension builds so does the heavy action. No telling who will win this free-for-all of femdom prowess, but it&#39;s certain that the lives and relationships of the participants will be irrevocably changed. A lively and entertaining femdom tale. The action is fast-paced, often hard and distinctly edgy, featuring women in control." />
