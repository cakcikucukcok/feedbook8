  <title>James and the Naughty Seagull - Lynne  Pickering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James is the littlest bear of three bears in his family. He tends to tell stories to get attention, so no one believes anything he says. When he really does have an adventure with a naughty seagull, no one believes him until the seagull is injured. It is up to James to come to the rescue! This delightful children&#39;s book was written and illustrated by Lynne Pickering, who says, &quot;We owned a childcare center for nine years and there were some children with behavioral problems. I often found if manners and examples of good Samaritan deeds were explained in a story concerning animals, the children often took notice and an improvement could be seen in them. If stories are told in a humorous and enjoyable tale, it gets through to them in a childlike way.&quot; She adds, &quot; I love painting, and it was enjoyable to paint this cute little shaggy bear and his adventures with this naughty seagull. The characters took a life of their own once I painted them.&quot; Her other children&#39;s book to be published include James and the Greedy Naughty Seagull, James and the Jealous Naughty Seagull, Is It You? and The Magic Doorway (a fairy story). Lynne Pickering resides in Warwick, Queensland, Australia. She paints art and exports art worldwide. Most of her children&#39;s books were written over ten years ago. She revised them and edited them to be published. &quot;We intend to open an art gallery and coffee shop at our country retreat where friends can come and enjoy the many rare bird species and wildlife.&quot; Publisher&#39;s website: http://sbpra.com/LynnePickering" />
