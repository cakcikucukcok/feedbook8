Prosecuting a controversial case involving a disturbed drifter accused of beating a woman to death, the fiercely ambitious Lu is determined to avoid the traps that have destroyed other competitive, successful women. She&amp;#8217;s going to play it smart to win this case&amp;#8212;and win big&amp;#8212;cementing her political future.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her intensive preparation for trial unexpectedly dredges up painful recollections of another crime&amp;#8212;the night when her brother, AJ, saved his best friend at the cost of another man&amp;#8217;s life. Only eighteen, AJ was cleared by a grand jury. Justice was done. Or was it? Did the events of 1980 happen as she remembers them? She was only a child then. What details didn&amp;#8217;t she know?&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she plunges deeper into the past, Lu is forced to face a troubling reality. The legal system, the bedrock of her entire life, does not have all the answers. But what happens when she realizes that, for the first time, she doesn&amp;#8217;t want to know the whole truth?&lt;/p&gt;" />
