  <title>A Single Father - Timothy Spears</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
You might think I&amp;rsquo;d made it over the toughest hurdles of parenting a young girl through the journey into womanhood, and so did I, until my beautiful 18-year-old daughter came to me one day with an unexpected request.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Daddy, I need you to help me with something.&amp;rdquo; She always&lt;br /&gt;
reverted to calling me &amp;ldquo;Daddy&amp;rdquo; when she wanted something from me, mainly because it always worked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I just gave you your allowance two days ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not that. You know how I broke up with Steven last month, right?&amp;rdquo; She sat down on the arm of my easy chair. I hit the pause button on the remote, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss anything that the Avengers were up to. &amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; she continued, &amp;ldquo;I decided that with school, and getting ready for college, and soccer that I don&amp;rsquo;t really have time for a boyfriend right now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love that plan,&amp;rdquo; I said and meant it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She gave me a pinch on the arm. &amp;ldquo;Listen, I&amp;rsquo;m serious about this. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a boyfriend, but that means I still have a problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And that problem is?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My daughter shifted uncomfortably next to me. &amp;ldquo;Okay, first of all, you know I&amp;rsquo;m not a virgin anymore, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whoa! The conversation had taken an unexpected turn. I suddenly had no idea where she was going with this. &amp;ldquo;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely sure, but, okay, now I know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;God, Daddy, don&amp;rsquo;t look so horrified. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m a total slut, or anything. It was only Steven.&amp;rdquo; She bit her lip and looked away as a slight flush colored her cheeks. &amp;ldquo;A lot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just what every father wants to hear. Then it dawned on me what she was leading up to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, God, you&amp;rsquo;re pregnant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; She smacked me on the shoulder. &amp;ldquo;Give me a little more credit than that. I&amp;rsquo;m on the pill and we always used condoms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How long have you been on the pill?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, like a year. Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s not the point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was relieved and somewhat hurt at the same time. &amp;ldquo;What is the point?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear this, but I really liked having sex.&amp;rdquo; She was right, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear it. &amp;ldquo;And I really, really miss it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
