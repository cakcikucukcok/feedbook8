  <title>Forbidden Garden - Victoria Burks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Entangled in a web of deceit and devastated by her broken engagement, Mackenzie Adams is overwhelmed by guilt and shame. Believing her sin is unforgiveable, Mackenzie flees her Arizona home, despite her parents objection, and travels to central Arkansas to take on full-time employment as nanny to the child of Andrew Huntington, owner of a well-known land development corporation. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terror strikes when Mackenzie arrives at the Huntington&#39;s historic estate, Park House, and discovers that Mr. Huntington&#39;s wife, Jasmine, has been murdered.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elise, the Huntingtons baby girl, captures Mackenzies heart. This relationship, along with the friendship of fellow employee, Angela Valincia, helps to offset the hostility Mackenzie tolerates from house manager, Mrs. Slater, and the unwelcome romantic pursuit of Greg Martin, Mr. Huntington&#39;s obnoxious chauffeur.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her trust level in men below zero, Mackenzies conception of the opposite sex is challenged when she meets her employers nephew, Trace Patterson, the debonair vice president of Huntington, Inc. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about Jasmine, Mackenzie senses a strong urge to search for her killer. With the aid of Angie, Mackenzie begins her surreptitious quest, ignoring the warning of jeopardy she might incur. Things heat up when Elise is kidnapped, Jasmines attorney, Jason Crane, is murdered, and the killer discovers that Mackenzie has a clue that will identify him.&lt;p&gt;" />
