  <title>Quinnterra - A. C. Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tarith, a man who has always led a very responsible and orderly life, is attuned to the Terrakia, the living, mystical energy that flows in one degree or another through every being in the realm of Quinnterra. He has always looked for that special person who could take up the fight that is on the horizon. But first, he needs the Councils permission to take in an apprentice. If Tarith fails, he will be imprisoned in the Terrafreeze for the reckless use of resources.
Tarith believes Zodiak is that right one for the job, but hes been wrong before. Zodiak has had a lot of experience as one of the galaxys greatest heroes, but hes about to see he has no idea what being a true hero is all about. Zodiak has been asked to leave his current life behind and join a universal battle that will reach across space and time. He will have to learn how to adapt to his new home and the people who have been there far longer than him.
After bringing Zodiak to Quinnterra, Tarith discovers Zodiak comes with some evil baggageinformation that must be kept from reaching the Council. Whats more, Zodiak faces a threat that has been right in front of him for a long time: love." />
