  <title>Making Daddy Mine - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jenna is returning home for a visit for the first time in years. Her bitchy stepmother drove Jenna away when she was only 18- but five years later, Jenna is a knockout model who misses her Daddy. Jenna isn&#39;t going to let her bitch stepmother, Susan, come between her and her Daddy anymore- and Jenna is determined to be the number one woman in her Daddy&#39;s life, once and for all. 
EXCERPT:
&quot;Oh, no! Honey, let me help you.&quot; Daddy grabbed his napkin and began mopping the wine from my shirt, overtly copping a feel of my breasts as he did so. He continued wiping the napkin over the wine stained across my breasts. His touch made my nipples hard, and sent a jolt of pleasure to my clit. 
&quot;For God&#39;s sake, Dan, she&#39;s a grown woman. I think she can clean herself up!&quot; Susan snapped. She threw a hand towel at me from across the table. &quot;Go get yourself cleaned up, Jenna.&quot; She nearly snarled at me, while glowering at my Daddy. 
I excused myself from the table, still giggling. Suddenly it occurred to me that this was going to be all too easy to get back at that bitch. As I changed my wine stained shirt into an even skimpier one, I decided once and for all that I was going to fuck my Daddy tonight, and there wasn&#39;t a damn thing she could do about it." />
