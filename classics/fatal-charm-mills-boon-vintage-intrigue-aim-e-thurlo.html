          &lt;strong&gt;He Was Tall, Dark and Dangerous…&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Not exactly the kind of man Amanda Vila was looking for as a father to her daughter. Then again, no other man had ever made her melt with desire–not like Tony Ramos. But Amanda always played by the rules–she couldn&#39;t possibly get romantically involved with a renegade lawman…a man of many faces….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She Was Sexy, Sweet and Secretive…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tony had always relied on his sex appeal to get what he wanted from women. With other women it had been a game. With Amanda… But Tony would do anything to get his kidnapped daughter back, even if it meant seducing Amanda, the one woman who was somehow the key to his daughter&#39;s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
