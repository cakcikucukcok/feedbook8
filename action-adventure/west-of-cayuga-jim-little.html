Thanks to a bond with an unlikely friend confined to servitude, he has somehow survived. As Green, his wife, and their children try to begin a new life, he must leave his friend behind. As the years pass, his family becomes larger, while the possibility of a Civil War grows greater, Green is about to discover that fate will play an even bigger part in his life than he ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

In an effort to protect his wife and five children from constant threats, he reluctantly leaves his beloved family behind and escapes to Indiana to establish a trade, hoping his wife and children can soon follow. When he joins the Union Army in an effort to find his family again, he has no idea that Greens has joined up to fight for the Confederates. As the two men arrive at the battle of Gettysburg via separate roads, their destinies await.&lt;/p&gt;
