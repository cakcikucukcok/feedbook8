  <title>A Gentleman of Substance - Julia Talbot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael St. James hates tidewater post-Colonial Virginia with a passion. Banished there thanks to an ill-timed&amp;nbsp;duel, Michael is bored with the countryside, and thinks his new companions are poorly-educated boors. What he needs is a challenge, something to stimulate his mind. Which is why, when Michael meets Daniel Calhoun, he takes such an immediate interest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Daniel Calhoun is a gentleman farmer who has no time for the social niceties demanded by a man of his station any more than he has patience for changing fashion or politics. When he sees Michael St. James, Daniel sees a man with no substance, and he&amp;rsquo;s certainly not interested in becoming friends, or more, with the irritating man. There&amp;rsquo;s more to Michael than meets the eye, as Daniel soon discovers, and the two embark on a scorching affair that might just be the ruin of both of them. Can they find a way to be together, or will Daniel and Michael be forced to hide what they feel?&lt;/p&gt;" />
