  <title>The One That Got Away - Christopher Wormell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The one that got away&#39; is the best-know phrase in fishing. Every angler has at least one story of being outwitted by a huge fish. A refrain of the angler, a taunt from those who live with them; it neatly sums up the way in which anglers are obsessed with the fish they almost caught. Yet to hear a fisherman tell the story of an escapee leviathan is to gain a great insight into why he fishes in the first place and why his sport is the most popular in the world. This is a collection of original stories from well-known angling enthusiasts and writers. They tell of unforgettable fish hooked and lost, of glimpsed monsters which haunt the imagination and draw the narrator back to a particular river or lake, time and again, in search of a re-match. David Steel loses his first-ever salmon after an epic struggle on the Ettrick; George Melly is upstaged by a giant Usk brown trout; Jeremy Paxman describes a fishing trip Stri Lankan style; Max Hastings was punished for being blasé and Bernard Venables - extending the definition of &#39;fish&#39; - relates a thrilling but tragic whaling adventure in the Azores.Chris Yates, holder of the British carp record, tells of his close encounter with an even bigger carp; David Profumo is humiliated by a 400lb shark; Brian Clarke has his angling life marred by a monster pike and Conrad Voss Bark actually helped his fish get away - and he swears it came back to say &#39;thank you&#39;. The pens of sixteen of the finest fishing writers have been at work describing salmon, trout, carp, pike, tarpon, shark, bass - fish from waters salty and fresh - all of which they missed. The result makes enthralling reading for anglers of every persuasion." />
