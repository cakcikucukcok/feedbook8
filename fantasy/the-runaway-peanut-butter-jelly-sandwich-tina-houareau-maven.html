  <title>The Runaway Peanut-Butter Jelly Sandwich - Tina Houareau, Maven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Runaway Peanut-Butter Jelly Sandwich was inspired by the authors only child, Sebastien when he was four. At that time, Sebastien would only eat peanut-butter jelly sandwich for breakfast. One day, out of a sense of defeat, his mother asked him, What would you do if all the ingredients magically disappeared? He stared at her with eyes full of wonder and responded, Well, Mama, where do they go? Later than night, this simple question led to the creation of Tinas three characters, Larry, Percy, and Sasafras. The first in a one-of-a-kind series, the book is designed to invite children and parents from all countries to get to know, follow, and love three very out-of-the-ordinary characters that make up a very popular American sandwich as they embark on thrilling adventures and meet other diverse foods from around the world who have also sprung to life! Ms. Houareau hopes that the pre-reading and post-reading comprehension exercises in the series will help sharpen critical thinking skills in children and that the lessons learned section will promote self-reflection and substantive dialogue with family and friends." />
