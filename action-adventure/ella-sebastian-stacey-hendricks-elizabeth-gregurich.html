  <title>Ella &amp; Sebastian - Stacey Hendricks, Elizabeth Gregurich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ella Mortimer is a bright nine-year-old girl who happens to have leukemia.  Diagnosed at the age of six, the long hospital visits, chemotherapy, blood transfusions, bouts of nausea, and lack of energy are taking a toll on Ella, who is a realist by nature.
To cheer her up, her mom, Rebecca, takes Ella and her siblings, Chelsea and Miles, on a vacation to Dreamcatchers, an aged amusement park that has seen better days.  Once there, Ella meets an intriguing boy named Sebastian, who lives in the amusement park.  With the help of this strange boy and his many wonderful adventures, Ella soon learns that there is more to life than just the facts and dreaming is every bit as important as the reality of her illness.
Ella &amp; Sebastian is based, in part, on the experience of Lydia, a girl who was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of six.  Like Ella, Lydia relapsed before her first round of treatments was completed and at times certainly needed a distraction from this disease.  We are delighted to announce that after five years of treatments, Lydia has been in remission for over three years and is now focusing on being a teenager.  
At Lydias request, a portion of the proceeds of this book will go to the Leukemia &amp;  Lymphoma Society to continue their efforts to find a cure for leukemia and other blood diseases, as well as the Childrens Miracle Network, whose local organization was essential in helping Lydia to fulfill her dreams while she was being treated, because every child deserves to dream." />
