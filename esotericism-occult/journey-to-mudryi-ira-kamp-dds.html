  <title>Journey to Mudryi - Ira Kamp Dds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The magic of human life has always fascinated Dr. Ira Kamp. Through his experiences with meditation, he uncovered the mysteries of healing and the human body. In Journey to Mudryi, Kamp discusses the basis of energetic, esoteric, and spiritual healing.  
He explores many issues relating to physical health and spiritual well-being and weaves both his personal and professional experiences to present a helpful resource for healers and those needing healing.
