&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Ten Golden Fields is a deliberate attempt to allow readers of fiction tales a more relaxing and fresh venue when they think they have some time to read. We hear tales about reading books falling off various cliffs. I think one reason is because people genuinely are in a nearly permanent hurry mode in their lives. In this book, anyone can read for thirty minutes and take in enough of a story to feel they have consumed something very entertaining and interesting for their soul-psyche. Its unlikely they will forget the characters and the next time they pick up the story to read; it can be a natural continuum. Also, I want these characters to say and do things that make them almost leap out of the pages and into the lives of my readers. To that end, I feel confident in saying that you will remember something about Ten Golden Fields in five years. And thats a very good thing for both of us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
