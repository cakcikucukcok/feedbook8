  <title>Emotional Transition - Vincent J. Interlande</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On his way to fifty, Vincent Interlande thought he lived a normal lifeuntil the many pressures of that life took him down. After thirty years, his marriage ended in divorce, blowing apart any sense that his life was well-balanced and harmonious. In the darkness of divorce, his soul sank into despair, and his mind began to reveal the emotional shadows that had eroded his life. He began to discover that he wore a mask of his faults, weaknesses, and failures. A shadow of the person he once was, he knew that it was time to figure out who he really was. It was time to live again. 
Like others, he faced trauma, heartache, disappointment, and grief that threw his behavior and emotional health out of balance. For Vincent, balance was restored via the written word and music. 
Emotional Transition is the product of his personal quest for understanding and sanity in a life that seemed devoid of both. A collection of musings on the experiences that contributed to his failures and his hidden, weak emotions, it documents how he overcame it all after a traumatic event. Through the use of detailed thought, personal stories of humor as well as misfortune presented as symbolic poetry, prose, and story, he seeks to inspire readers to become more aware of themselves as well. 
The readings may seem like only a personal stories but if read by the individual reader&#39;s portraying of him/herself with the content of this book, they will gain insight into themselves.   This is the intent of Emotional Transition.
Vincent challenges the reader to walk in his shoes, look in the mirror, and then ask themselves, What person is looking back at me, and where is that life going from here?" />
