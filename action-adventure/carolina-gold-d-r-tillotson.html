  <title>Carolina Gold - D.R. Tillotson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Jake Cooper had it made, high school All-American football player, beautiful girlfriend Jenny, fame and the potential fortune of the NFL. But when he meets Chris Stephens, an 11 year-old history geek and son of a war hero, Jake starts down a path he could never have imagined. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Chris discovers a map on a mysterious medallion that he believes points to an ancient Aztec treasure. He convinces Jenny and her bully of a boyfriend Jake to leave California and join him on a secret trip during spring break to search for the treasure he believes is hidden in North Carolina. The kids are aided by a sage old Cherokee Indian named Luke who was branded a coward by his tribe and has lived alone for most of his life. Lukes wisdom helps Jake see manhood in a different light. But, will Lukes gentle way help the kids in their quest?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When the kids reach their destination they encounter their dishonest History teacher and his criminal friends who want to steal the treasure. Chris, Jake and Jenny will have to outsmart the evil teacher; but can a precocious 11 year-old boy, a cheerleader and a high school linebacker defeat three armed and dangerous criminals?&lt;/P&gt;" />
