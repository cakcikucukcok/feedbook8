  <title>Imagination and Environmental Political Thought - Joshua J. Bowman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Imagination and Environmental Political Thought: The Aftermath of Thoreau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; seeks to correct oversimplified readings of Henry David Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s political thought by elucidating a key tension within his imagination. With the celebration of Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s two-hundredth birthday now past, this study outlines, and builds on, his own understanding of imagination and considers its implications for environmental politics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the use of the word, &amp;ldquo;aftermath,&amp;rdquo; Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s legacy for environmental political thought is primarily constructive and foundational for modern environmentalism. Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s virtues and vices have been inherited by his environmentally-conscious readers. The author of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Walden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;rsquo;s preference for an abstract, ahistorical &amp;ldquo;higher law,&amp;rdquo; his radical concept of autonomy, and his frustration with government and community foster an impractical political thought characteristic of an idyllic imagination. Nevertheless, Thoreau demonstrates a more prudential and moral imagination by emphasizing the inescapable relationship between the moral order of individuals and the order of political communities and by pioneering the central questions of humanity&amp;rsquo;s relationship to non-human nature. Can this tension of imaginations be resolved? What are the consequences of this tension? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s overall vision ultimately creates significant problems with which environmentalists still struggle. While Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on freedom and the immaterial aspects of human and non-human nature are of considerable value, his abstract political morality, misanthropy and escapism must be resisted both for the sake of environmental well-being and human dignity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, this book is an exercise in re-thinking how the humanities may provide scholars critical insights to better diagnose and respond to the environmental challenges of our time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
