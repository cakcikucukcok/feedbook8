        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;City girl Tess Barrett hopes her move to Barrett&#39;s Mill, Virginia, will give her a fresh start. As she gets to know the family she&#39;s never met and begins work at their sawmill, everything starts falling into place. Until she meets Heath Weatherby. After narrowly escaping an oil rig explosion, Heath won&#39;t waste his second chance at life. He&#39;s committed to starting a family–and he wants Tess for his wife. Tess refuses to give in to her feelings for Heath, convinced they&#39;re just too different. But when the rugged mechanic is hired to fix her family&#39;s mill, her heart begins to recognize the charming country boy as her one true love.&lt;/p&gt;
