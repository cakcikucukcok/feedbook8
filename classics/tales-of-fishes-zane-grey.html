  <title>Tales of Fishes - Zane Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tales of Fishes, by Zane Grey presents a novelist wielding pen and rod simultaneously, thereby banishing a host of preconceptions concerning the sedentary nature of angling. To one unacquainted with tuna fish except in salad, the narrative becomes a revelation of adventure. Swordfish, shark, and dolphin yield zestful chapters. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
American author Zane Grey is best known as a pioneer of the Western literary genre, which idealized the Western frontier and the men and women who settled the region. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Following in his father s footsteps, Grey studied dentistry while on a baseball scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. Grey s athletic talent led to a short career in the American minor league before he established his dentistry practice. As an outlet to the tedium of dentistry, Grey turned to writing, and finally abandoned his dental practice to write full time. Over the course of his career Grey penned more than ninety books, including the best-selling Riders of the Purple Sage. Many of Grey s novels were adapted for film and television." />
