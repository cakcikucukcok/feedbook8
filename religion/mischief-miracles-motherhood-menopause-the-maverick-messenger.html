  <title>Mischief, Miracles, Motherhood, &amp; Menopause - The Maverick Messenger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Mischief, Miracles, Motherhood, and Menopause&lt;/i&gt; shares the stories of where author Julie B.s life has taken her and what she has learned from each experience. Dubbing herself The Maverick Messenger, she is a therapist, artist, singer-songwriter, author, wife, mother, and recovering alcoholic. 
She tells humorous and touching tales of being the baby of her family, dealing with the realities of flat-chestedness, surviving the pregnancy and birth of twins, and dating again after a divorce. She offers her take on being an overwhelmed mother of three teenagers while mired in the hormonal hell of menopause. 
Julie also candidly shares painful and heartfelt stories about her rape at age twelve, her experiences with drinking through the ten years that covered her twenties, and her journey through recovery and divorceas well as two miscarriages, a house-fire, three hurricanes, and her fathers death. Although each experience was devastating in its own right, as a whole they have given her a down-to-earth perspective on love, faith, and relationships.
She hopes to inspire others to reevaluate their own lives and relationships with an open mind and heart. Her light-hearted, humorous perspective on a variety of subjects from adolescence to alcoholism will keep you laughing and crying at the same time." />
