  <title>Momentitiousness - Jason Leclerc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since they first named it, attention deficit disorder (ADD) has been a marker for the American generation who came of age between Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, with Prince or the Beastie Boys playing in the background while the Mario Brothers and the Golden Girls battled in the foreground. Back then, education, football, and Hollywood were wrapped in capitalism and sentimentality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embracing distraction and fighting with concentration, &lt;i&gt;Momentitiousness&lt;/i&gt; captures the spirit and literary needs of this generation and its heirs with its spurious connections and tangential relationships. Loosely lassoing the possibilities enabled by the digital evolution toward boundless search, this novel collection first establishes the you and then proceeds to obliterate the I in multiple dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nibble on this new literary formobsessively perched between collection and novelas it wanders along a least-squares path from moment to moment, from singularity to communion. Here, find storiesfrom arbitrage to zombies, Chicago to Columbia, dark to energyabout love and disappointment, science and spirits, and life, death, and the undead. Feast upon this antidote to the mundane as it irreverently exalts the soul of an ADD generation like a collection of first kisses: nostalgic and sweet, sensuous and raw, tenuously related, and well wrought.&lt;/p&gt;" />
