  <title>THE FOUR BROTHERS - A Children&#39;s Story from India - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 461&lt;br /&gt;
In this 461st issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates an Indian fairy tale - &amp;quot;The Four Brothers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago in the jungles of India stood a very old tree.&lt;br /&gt;
Every spring it put out fresh green leaves and lovely white blossoms, but one year the flowers were more beautiful than ever, and among them, on one of the lower branches, was a bud which hung there like a silver globe among the green leaves.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wonder why that bud is so much larger than the others,&amp;quot; said the rose-apple tree, who had a great deal of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It holds a secret,&amp;quot; replied the fig-tree, who was quite a gossip and loved to talk to the other trees.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But when shall we know the secret?&amp;quot; asked the rose-apple tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;In the middle of the night there will be a thunder-storm and then the bud will open. You will see it by the lightning.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what was revealed you ask&amp;hellip;? What was in the bud? Was it a baby, a princess or some other magical being? And, what happened when the storm was over? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE BABA INDABA STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;br /&gt;
In looking up these place names, using Google Maps, it is our hope that young people will click on the images and do further investigations about the people who live in these towns and and gain an appreciation for the many and varied cultures from around the world. Through this, it is our hope that young people will not only increase their knowledge of world geography but also increase their understanding and tolerance of other peoples and cultures. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
