  <title>Suspicion&#39;s Gate - Tamara Brigham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The villagers of Ste Marie sur Canut have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not as big of a problem as the Allied soldiers detained in Stalag 31 under the guardianship of Oberfuhrer von Hausen and his officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems boil down to trust and power: who has it, and who does not. Who can manipulate it and who can undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut off from the leadership in Berlin, assigned to a yearlong posting at this backwater Stalag for what amounts to guard duty, Von Hausen does his best to make the most of the hand the Reich has dealt him, accepting the post because he believes this appointment is the best thing for his beautiful, troubled Jenny-wren. He never counted on Clara, or the men he was assigned to guard, burrowing beneath his skin in ways that threaten his command at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sturmbahnfuhrer Stetcher may, undoubtedly, be the greatest threat of all. To everyone...if von Hausen cannot deduce his plans in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men behind the barbed wire, strong men, brave men, fight night and day for survival...determined to beat the odds, find a way out of hell, rebuild their lives. Surely they don&amp;#39;t deserve to die for their misfortunes&amp;hellip;or their determination to live...if only they could content themselves with following orders...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only this damned war would end and they could all go home alive...&lt;/p&gt;" />
