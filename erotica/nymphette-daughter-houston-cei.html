~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For almost three months after the sexual encounter that Henry, Frank and Jessie had with Beth and her daughters, it was Jessie who could not stop thinking and talking about Beth. He had only known her for one night but spoke of her as if they had been friends for years. Henry and Frank were amused by his conversation but also somewhat confused that someone with the playboy&amp;#39;s reputation that Jessie had would be so infatuated with someone who could be described as a &amp;quot;plump, older woman&amp;quot; by the average young airman. Jessie would have none of that; Beth was his Mona Lisa and he was despondent that he did not even have her address, her phone number or even her last name. All he could do was hitch-hike to town and back more times than he really needed to in the hope that she would once again offer him a ride.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As fate would have it, the contact Jessie had dreamed of, finally happened. A fellow airman came from the day room to tell him that he had a phone call, &amp;quot;Sounds like a sexy chick, you lucky dog.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jessie answered the phone in the day room&amp;nbsp; and as soon as he heard, &amp;quot;Hello Jessie, this is Beth,&amp;quot; he felt the butterflies in his stomach. He was very nervous but also was thrilled that she had called. Although he had no way of getting in touch with her, it was easy to call the airbase and get the extension to the barracks, and for that fact, Jessie was thankful beyond words. He was shaking and his words were stuttered, and realizing his anxiety, Beth said the things she hoped he wanted to hear so as to put him at ease. She invited him for dinner and a visit and said that she could come to the base to pick him up at this very moment. Of course, he accepted the invitation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After hanging up the phone, Jessie went to the parking lot outside the barracks to wait for his ride. It would take at least fifteen minutes to drive from town to the base, but that was not on his mind at that time; he just simply wanted to be there waiting so as not to miss his dear Beth. While waiting, it struck him that he was the only one invited and was thus wondering exactly what the &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; would entail, but more importantly, he was just delighted that he would see the woman he loved and had been missing for several weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the car arrived, Jessie saw that only Janice accompanied Beth, and with no sign of Julie, he made no assumptions and asked no questions. Beth got out of the car to approach him as he was standing in the parking lot.&amp;nbsp; She gave him a tender kiss on the lips that was received with whistles from a group of four airmen passing by, and then Jessie was finally at ease. Seeing Beth and feeling the touch of her lips on his along with the amusing approval of the other airmen put an end to all of his previous anxiety. She opened the car door for Jessie in chauffeur-like fashion with him to ride shotgun while Janice would ride in the back seat. Looking a little different from their last meeting, Beth was wearing a fashionable mini-skirt and as she sat in the driver&amp;#39;s seat her skirt was hiked up to the point that Jessie had a perfect view of her hefty, but beautifully shaped legs." />
