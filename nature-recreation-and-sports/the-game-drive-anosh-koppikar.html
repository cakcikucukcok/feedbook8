  <title>The Game Drive - Anosh Koppikar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His passion for wildlife brought Anosh Koppikar, a stock market person to writing and presenting to the world his best moments which he has captured as a wildlife photographer over the years bygone. The book provides a photographic account of his travels to some of the most well known game parks in India and Africa ranging from the rugged tiger habitat and lush forests of Central India (Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench and Tadoba) to the open endless savannahs of East Africa ( Masai Mara, Serengeti, Ngorongoro and Lake Manyara) which is home to the big 5 viz, lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino and leopard . Designed primarily as a travelogue the book also seems to double up as a travel guide should one wish to visit these places. There are several coffee table books by renowned wildlife photographers around but this is by someone whose profession of stock trading is not even remotely related to what this book is all about. He visits these places each year, not for a living but for an inner calling. Through this book Anosh not only gives us insight into another world that many of us know nothing about, but also ignite the passion he has for these remarkable kings of the jungle." />
