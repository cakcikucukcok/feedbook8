  <title>Roses of the Angel - Kalee Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eve Williams is ready to begin her senior year in high school with the help of her family, friends, and faith. As she heads to her first class, Eve is already wondering who will ask her to prom. But when football player and notorious bad boy Ryan Mitchell walks into the classroom, Eve thinks she has her answer. Soon he asks her on a date and Eve accepts, despite warnings from her friends and her own misgivings.  Ryan is the mastermind behind the school&#39;s bullying problem and her friends are his victims. To exacerbate the issue, he cheats on her and their relationship ends. Disheartened, Eve embraces her single life, earns a generous college scholarship, and works as a retail store manager. But on Halloween night, everything changes as a robbery unfolds at the store, leaving Eve unconscious and a secret admirer to reveal himself.  Roses of the Angel is the tale of a teenager as she grapples with affairs of the heart and struggles to find her way in life." />
