  <title>Bill Oddie&#39;s Little Black Bird Book - Bill Oddie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bird-watchers are tense, competitive, selfish, shifty, dishonest, distrusting, boorish, pedantic, unsentimental, arrogant and - above all - envious&#39;. So says Bill Oddie, and he should know! It&#39;s a tough environment out there on marsh and moorland, and this scurrilous little classic is a must for all devoted birders and twitchers (and as Bill relates, there is a mighty difference!). With years of hard-earned experience, Bill dares to say all the things that other b&#39;s and t&#39;s will recognize as true but which they have never dared to own up or admit to, even to themselves. Whether discussing the birds he&#39;s seen, the birds that got away, equipment, apparel, sightings, cock-ups, places to visit or people to avoid, Bill&#39;s enthusiasm is infectious, and his knowledge unsurpassed. This little black book is one item that no serious birdwatcher can afford to leave out of the rucksack, and it will prove an essential companion when trudging the estuaries and riverbanks, in torrential rain and gusty gale in search of that elusive rare beauty." />
