  <title>In My Secret Place - Rev. Thomas L. Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains original poems given to the me by inspiration of The Holy Spirit. In it are poems about Biblical Characters and adaptations of the scriptures. It also contains poetic recitations with a Biblical perspective performed by the in local churches in his area. I feel a need to share the Word of God in verse to a lost and hurting world. I pray that this book will be as much of a blessing to the reader as it has been to the writer.  As I was having the cover picture taken for my book, I was again reminded about the importance of daily prayer and meditation upon the Lord and His goodness.  This photo was taken in &quot;My Secret Place&quot; where I go (not often enough I might add) to commune with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Unless you have your own place where you commune with God on a daily basis you can never realize the fullness of His greatness and His mercy.  Go without pretense, God knows who you are, He made you and He wants to hear from YOU!  May God richly bless you through these simple poems penned down by a simple country preacher who preaches about a Great and Awesome God!" />
