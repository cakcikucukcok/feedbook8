  <title>Riches to Rags to Riches - Heidi Guttman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It says in the Bible that we are to give 10% of our gross income to God which is the tithe. We are to take our tithe to our local church. Many make out their tithe without really giving it much thought, which is the way it should be. Whereas, many others put too much thought into tithing which only complicates the act of tithing. God made tithing to be very simple and uncomplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Riches to Rags to Riches: The Power of Tithing&lt;/i&gt;, author Heidi Guttman tells her story of tithing. Life for Guttman was good. She had material things that would make many people envious: a beautiful townhouse, expensive art, awesome cars, gorgeous furs, expensive jewelry, and a sport yacht, among other things. There was even a leather high chair for the baby. When she lost most of her possessions because she disobeyed Gods instructions about tithing, however, Guttman learned the power of material wealth to distance her from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riches to Rags to Riches: The Power of Tithing&lt;/i&gt; teaches the importance of tithing from Gods perspective. Learn about the rewards you can reap from tithingand the losses you can sustain from not tithing. Guttman learned the difference firsthand. When she began tithing faithfully, God restored her in all ways. This can happen to you. As a result of tithing, you can experience Gods love, peace, and abundancea blessing that so many people long for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
