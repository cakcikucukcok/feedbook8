  <title>The Murder of Harriet Monckton - Elizabeth Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the award-winning and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/i&gt; comes a delicious Victorian crime novel based on a true story that shocked and fascinated the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 7th November 1843, Harriet Monckton, 23 years old and a woman of respectable parentage and religious habits, is found murdered in the privy behind the chapel she regularly attended in Bromley, Kent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community is appalled by her death, apparently as a result of swallowing a fatal dose of prussic acid, and even more so when the surgeon reports that Harriet was around six months pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the coroner’s reports and witness testimonies, Elizabeth Haynes builds a compelling picture of Harriet’s final hours through the eyes of those closest to her and the last people to see her alive. Her fellow teacher and companion, her would-be fiancé, her seducer, her former lover—all are suspects; each has a reason to want her dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brimming with lust, mistrust and guilt, &lt;i&gt;The Murder of Harriet Monckton&lt;/i&gt; is a masterclass of suspense from one of our greatest crime writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
