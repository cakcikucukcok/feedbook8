  <title>Make It Last - Megan Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Bowler University, the last place Cam Ruiz ever expected to find himself is his hometown. A bad job as a bouncer and worry over his mom&amp;#39;s health make living in Paradise anything but. There&amp;#39;s only one thing that can make his return any harder&amp;#8212;running into the only girl he&amp;#39;s ever loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tate Ellison made a mistake when she was eighteen, one that cost her the best thing she&amp;#39;s ever had. She always hoped the pain of losing Cam would fade over time. Too bad it&amp;#39;s only grown. She took comfort in the fact that she&amp;#39;d never have to face him again, so his presence in Paradise throws her for a loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pull between them is instant, and when the truth of what happened years ago tumbles out, they share a mind-blowing kiss &amp;#8230; which leads to more. But the past has a way of repeating itself. When all the cards are on the table, Cam and Tate must decide what they are willing to do to make it last.&lt;/p&gt;" />
