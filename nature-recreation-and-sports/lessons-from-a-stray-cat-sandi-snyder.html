  <title>Lessons from a Stray Cat - Sandi Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She was trying to make it on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was just a half-grown, gray cat, apparently dumped at the side of the road.  No one wanted her, and no one wanted the responsibility of finding her a home.  The person who left her there probably carelessly assumed that she was old enough to take care of herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wasnt doing a very good job of it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Snyder family already had a cat.  His name was Jabez, and he had been adopted from a local animal shelter two years previous to the strays arrival.  A second cat wasnt part of the Snyders plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the small, stray cat entered their lives, the Snyders found themselves the recipients of the unexpected blessings of laughter, love, and lessons they would never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a warm, conversational style, Sandi offers the reader a months worth of charming anecdotes about the two cats, each coupled with a Bible lesson that warms the heart.  Young and old alike will delight in this devotional study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a special feature, journal pages are included in the back of the book, enabling each reader to record his/her own spiritual insights, thoughts, and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
