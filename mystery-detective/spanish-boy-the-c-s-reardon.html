  <title>Spanish Boy, The - C.S. Reardon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grief cannot abide a mystery. No one understands that better than the Clarey family of Halifax.&lt;br&gt;In 1937, the Clareys are a close and loving family until their lives are transformed the night Edie, their wilful daughter and sister, vanishes, leaving no trace, no clue, as to what happened to her.&lt;br&gt;The lingering questions of her disappearance will ricochet through succeeding generations of Clareys.&lt;br&gt;As decades pass and lives unfold, the memories of Edie&#39;s brothers and her parents, are haunted by the spectre of the missing girl. The misery of their grief is entangled with the only comfort they can find: a belief that one day the mystery of Edie&amp;rsquo;s disappearance will be solved.&lt;br&gt;Drawn into Edie&amp;rsquo;s young life, and into her story, are two young men who work at her father&#39;s business: the bookkeeper Raymond Gillis and a stranger named Micah Gessen. The three form a triangle of jealousy and obsession. One of them knows what happened to the Clarey girl.&lt;br&gt;Just as Edie&amp;rsquo;s vanishing is a moment of transformation for the Clarey family, so are the times they live in. The story of &lt;i&gt;The Spanish Boy&lt;/i&gt; is told against the backdrop of some of the momentous events of the twentieth and earliest part of the twenty-first centuries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
