  <title>The Impetuous Journey of Harry Fisher, Cat - Charlotte Lewis, Layton Eversaul, Lynnaea Brodar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Harry Fisher is about ten years old. He is a long-haired,
fl uffy-tailed, very white house cat with no claws. Harry
talks all the time but this is the fi rst time that his caregiver
has tried to translate his meowings into a story. One
evening he was accidentally shut out of the house. As he
was out for the fi rst time, he decided to explore a bit as
no one would be home to let him in for some time. He
got lost. This story tells of his time away from home and
how he relied on the goodness of others to protect him.
His caregiver, Charlotte Lewis, normally writes mysteries
and historical fi ction. She is a 75-year old great-great
grandmother who lives in Vancouver, Washington." />
