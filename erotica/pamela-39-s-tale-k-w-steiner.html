  <title>Pamela&#39;s Tale - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Middle-aged English teacher Pamela, a wife and mother, discovers that there is more to life in picturesque Regal Bay, especially her sex life, if only she has the courage to take that first step. When she gathers the courage to take that first step, the next become all the easier to take, down the dark path towards the ultimate sin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Pamela stood beneath the shower spray, the hot water rinsing the soap from her soft body. She was both exhausted and exhilarated at once. As a recent image of her young lover, taking her from behind, flashed through her mind, her pussy trembled between her thighs. A warm trickle of recently spilled semen dribbled from her well-fucked vagina and slid down her inner thigh, mingling with the warm water from the shower as it headed for the shower stall drain. She reached down between her thighs and slipped a long finger up inside herself. She swirled her finger within her ravaged opening and pulled even more of the seed out. There was a lot to remove.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This had been the third time she had secretly met with Freddy Killibrew. Pamela knew she was pushing her luck. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be long before she was caught, she knew that. Eventually someone would recognize her. Eventually her husband would start to question why she was spending so much time with friends after work and figure out that she was having an affair. Eventually she would figure out a better way to find her sexual release. Eventually she knew she would have to take the next step and make her son aware of the fact that she so desperately wanted him.&lt;br /&gt;
