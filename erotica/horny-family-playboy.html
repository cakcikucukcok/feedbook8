  <title>Horny Family - Playboy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The story of a father daring to let his most base desires and passions loose. Is he willing to accept the consequences, the reward or punishment, for allowing passion for his daughter to emerge just so he can be sexually fulfilled? Is his family perverted or really a normal complexity of everyday life? How can he prevent his incestuous passions from becoming exposed; from causing another scandal to hit the news?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As he washed her back, he kissed her shoulder, then asked in her ear, &amp;quot;Why did you call me daddy?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She tensed up and nervously laughed. &amp;quot;I thought it was hot, that&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He knew she was withholding the truth, so he smacked her ass hard. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t make me ask you a second time Lindsey. Give me the truth please; don&amp;#39;t be like your mom.&amp;quot; As soon as he said that last part, he regretted saying it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She slowly turned toward him, water cascading down her breasts. He could tell she was upset at him but shook her head as if trying to clear her mind. Softly she spoke to him, &amp;quot;Nineteen years ago, you and my mom made love just like we did last night. She was madly in love with you. Did you know that?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He responded very softly, his eyes dancing from her beauty to her eyes. &amp;quot;I do know, as I love her, always will. But...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There are no buts!&amp;quot; She interrupted him. &amp;quot;Mom recently told me before she was taken out of this world by Larry...&amp;quot; She paused took a deep breath and continued, &amp;quot;I am the result of the love you had for each other.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jimmy&amp;#39;s jaw hit the floor, as he stepped back against the shower wall. His hand going to his mouth as he felt like the air had been sucked out of him. His mind started reeling, that it was true, and why the hell didn&amp;#39;t his sister tell him. His thoughts went from shock to being angry as he felt he missed his daughter growing up. Then his thoughts went to fear, as he just made love to his daughter and ejaculated in her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She could sense what he was thinking, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry daddy, I&amp;#39;m on the pill.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Daddy&amp;#39;, there was that word again. He felt his body sink onto the wet floor of the shower, bending his knees and putting his head in both hands. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry Lindsey, I wish I knew.&amp;quot;" />
