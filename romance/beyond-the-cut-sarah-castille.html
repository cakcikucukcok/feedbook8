      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SHE&#39;S HOLDING ON TIGHT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a teen, Dawn ran from a life on the streets straight into the arms of Jimmy &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Sanchez, a biker who promised to be her knight in shining armor. But his love was just another cage. Years later, Dawn&#39;s former life still has its hooks in her and she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to break free. When Cade &quot;Ryder&quot; O&#39;Connor, a member of a rival club, makes her an offer, Dawn finds herself in a different, hotter kind of trouble with one irresistible Sinner...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WILL HE GIVE HER THE RIDE OF HER LIFE?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Cade is an outlaw biker with allegiance to one thing and one thing only: The Sinner&#39;s Tribe Motorcycle Club. But when it comes to the stunningly sexy, fiercely independent Dawn Delgado, Cade finds himself...hungrier for more. Trouble is on Dawn&#39;s heels and he wants to be the answer to her prayers, whether she wants him to be or not. What can&#39;t be denied is the red-hot attraction between them. However, as they fall deeper, the danger rises and Cade may have to sacrifice it all...in &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Cut &lt;/i&gt;by &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Sarah Castille.&lt;/p&gt;" />
