  <title>The Princess and Her Pirate - Lois Greiman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Princess Tatiana needs a groom to help her rule her vulnerable country. So she embarks on a desperate mission --  traveling in disguise to a neighboring land to forge an alliance with the dashing Cairn MacTavish, the fabled &quot;Pirate Lord.&quot; But instead of a marriage, a rude welcome awaits the brave, beautiful royal when she is accused of being a common thief -- and is taken captive by the rogue she had meant to wed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not since his adventurous days on the high seas has MacTavish felt the sort of excitement this gorgeous hellion inspires. He knows she is hiding something -- and each claim of innocence that comes from her lush, inviting lips only inflames his desire for a kiss...and for the passionate night that will inevitably follow. Yet a past betrayal is still fresh in MacTavish&#39;s memory, and he dares not trust his heart. Now he vows to learn this mystery woman&#39;s secrets...even if he has to seduce her to do it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
