  <title>The Wager - Bill Atherton, Jason Mccaig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though my friends and I had been making wagers with each other and daring each other with different things all through our lives together nothing had prepared me for what was in store for me that night after lodge meeting as we sat talking about one thing then another. They bet me $1000.00 that I wouldn&#39;t spend the night in the old Mize castle. Naturally I accepted. We planned the event for Friday the 13th none the less  and set up camp at the edge of the castle grounds. It was near dusk when I started my trek through the castle. Little did I know that my journey would be into parallel realms of existence, other time frames, and even other worlds and kingdoms. To say nothing of the deities I would be forced to meet and the near death experiences. But it did give me food for thought as to the possibilities of the existence of life in other realms, some that run parallel to ours. 
          Had it not been for a teen age boy, Jake and his furry friend, Oola as well as Diana, Jacque, and their pet, Gar who saved me on more than one occasion I more than likely would have been lost somewhere in time in a universe that we believe is non-existent. 
          But what is it that lies beyond that which our minds are limited to accept as fact ? Is it possible that there is an existence out there someplace ? Or better yet is it possible that we are just a figment of a greater beings imagination and that all we say and do is only their thoughts, and our existence rests only in their thoughts of us ?" />
