          &lt;strong&gt;It was a night like no other…darker, longer and totally unforgettable Sara Douglas watched as Nick Tyson emerged from the heavy rain. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In his face she saw little of the boy she once knew. She&#39;d returned to Cape Darkwood to research her parents&#39; murder. And stop the nightmares. Was Nick just another terrifying dream–or a flesh-and-blood man who would leave her breathless? Chief of police now, pain etched Nick&#39;s rough face, colored his eyes navy blue.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;d lost someone, too, but while Sara ran, Nick had nowhere else to go. Instead, he patrolled a divided town whose secrets lay dormant at the bottom of the cliffs. Nick wouldn&#39;t let that be Sara&#39;s fate, no matter how much it pained him to see her again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Together their investigation mounted and led them to horrifying consequences–but more lethal than the case was their undeniable and deadly desire for each other…&lt;/p&gt;
