  <title>The Last Moon - DeAnn Lubell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On May 8, 1902, Mt. Pele on the West Indies island of Martinique near the seaport town of St. Pierre erupted in a cloud of gas and fire in one of the most awesome and destructive pyrotechnic displays ever offered by nature. Four minutes later, thirty thousand citizens lay dead or dying, and
the town engulfed in flames. Mother Nature was not entirely to blame for this disaster. In truth, the real culprits were the rather more deplorable traits found in Human Nature. If not for the dishonesty and corruption of officials who placed politics, greed, and racial intolerance above the welfare of the people, this devastating catastrophe did not have to happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Last Moon remains true to historical facts and personal testimonies. The main characters presented in this novel are either composites of real individuals who lived in Martinique prior to the eruption or actual people who influenced the turn of events. Also historically genuine are the Creole language, clothing, mix of races, diversified lifestyles, corrupt politics, racial discrimination, whorehouses, blackmagic, clergy, plantations, waterfront, plagues, floods, earthquakes, tidal-waves, lava and mud flows, volcanic eruptions, foreign
ships, deadly snakes, mutant insects, lush topography, and the before-and-after sequence of the 1902 tragedy. Dramatically
captured in this exotic saga are acts of friendship, forbidden love, lust, pride, gluttony, cruelty, corruption, mass murder, bravery, sacrifice, survival, faith, and hope.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book Review&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Very highly recommended for community library historical fiction collections&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A riveting read from first page to last, &quot;The Last Moon&quot; is a novel set against the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelee on the West Indies island of Martinique that resulted in the death of some thirty thousand people and the seaport town of St. Pierre consumed by fire. An impressive historical novel, author DeAnn Lubell has paid careful attention to detail and accuracy with respect to historical facts including the Creole language spoken there, the culture, lifestyles, geography, and the geological phenomena that occur with respect to the eruption of a volcano. Against this superbly presented background is an engaging story of lust, greed, corruption, and murder, as well as friendship, love, sacrifice, faith, hope -- and survival. Deftly written from beginning to end, and available in both a hardcover and a softcover edition, &quot;The Last Moon&quot; is very highly recommended for community library historical fiction collections. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Dear DeAnnI just finished reading THE LAST MOON, and I&#39;m so impressed with your wonderful book!  The research you must have done is overwhelming with attention to such detail.  I loved Yvette, such a strong and interesting character!  You took me back in time and to a place I&#39;ve never been, but allowed me to experience it as though I was actually there.  I&#39;m still dusting the volcanic ash off myself!  Congratulations to you for a beautifully written story! THE LAST MOON was a masterpiece!...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
