  <title>Help! My Patient Is A Futanari! - Ashley Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The last thing Dr. Saanvi Prabhu wanted was a difficult patient first thing in the morning. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what she got when Olivia arrived with a big, hard and very personal problem. The good doctor must forgo traditional medicine, and deliver some hands-on sensual healing. There&amp;rsquo;s only one problem: when your patient is a desperate teenage futanari, one visit simply isn&amp;rsquo;t enough!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;HELP! MY PATIENT IS A FUTANARI! is over 10,000 words of sexy fun between a female doctor and her futanari patient, with a HEA ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;It was an unusually quiet morning for Dr. Saanvi Prabhu. Only one patient&amp;rsquo;s name came up in the system, and it was Olivia Lombardy&amp;ndash;a name she found strangely familiar but came with no records.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;She said the name out loud, feeling it on her tongue. &amp;ldquo;Where do I know this one?&amp;rdquo; The patient&amp;rsquo;s date of birth indicated that she had just turned eighteen, so if Saanvi had seen her before, it must have been when the patient was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Saanvi took off her black-rimmed glasses and wiped them with a tissue. No face came to mind to match that name, but that was to be expected. How many thousands of patients had she seen over the years? She liked to think she had a good memory for names and faces, but even she couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Might as well solve this mystery now,&amp;rdquo; she said, blowing a strand of thick, black hair from her face and slipping her glasses back on before stepping out into the waiting room.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Miss Lombardy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman with strawberry blonde curls looked up at her and smiled. She had delicate white skin and was a little chubby, but had a kind face that would make anybody want to be her friend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Saanvi returned the smile. &amp;ldquo;Would you step into my office, please?&amp;rdquo; Olivia stood up and, head slightly lowered, followed Saanvi into the small, white doctor&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;As the doctor closed the door behind her, she had no reason to think this day would be like any other. Little did she know that her personal and professional life would change forever after seeing this one special patient." />
