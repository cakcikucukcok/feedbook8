  <title>Rebecca’S Soliloquy - Roberta Nee Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Moffatt finds a wounded Union officer on her familys farm and nurses him back to healthnot too remarkable, except that her husband is a Confederate officer away at war! Little does she know that her actions will set into motion a series of events that will see her making a journey of over 250 miles from Obion County, Tennessee, to St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She travels mostly on foot with an older couple who were former slaves on the farm, an old horse, and a two-wheeled dogcart. Her mission is to get her wounded husband out of prison camp there and bring him home. But at what cost? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there are many volumes of well-documented facts about the Civil War, there are untold thousands of stories of individual struggles and courage of that time. Most are lost to history, but this one has survived, the story being told orally from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This true story of grim determination, courage, and the strength of the bonds of love is so compelling that it has survived to be told 150 years later.&lt;/p&gt;" />
