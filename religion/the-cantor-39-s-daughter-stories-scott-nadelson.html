  <title>The Cantor&#39;s Daughter: Stories - Scott Nadelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cantor&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is the compelling new collection from Oregon Book Award Winner and recipient of the GLCA&#39;s New Writers Award for 2005, Scott Nadelson. In his follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Saving Stanley,&lt;/i&gt; these stories capture Jewish New Jersey suburbanites in moments of crucial transition, when they have the opportunity to connect with those closest to them or forever miss their chance for true intimacy. In &quot;The Headhunter,&quot; two men develop an unlikely friendship at work, but after twenty years of mutually supporting each other&amp;#8217;s families and careers their friendship comes to an abrupt and surprising end. In the title story, Noa Nechemia and her father have immigrated from Israel following a tragic car accident her mother did not survive. In one stunning moment of insight following a disastrous prom night, Noa discovers her ability to transcend grief and determine the direction of her own life. And in &amp;#147;Half a Day in Halifax&amp;#8221; Beth and Roger meet on a cruise ship where their shared lack of enthusiasm for their trip sparks the possibility of romance. Nadelson&#39;s stories are sympathetic, heartbreaking, and funny as they investigate the characters&#39; fragile emotional bonds and the fears that often cause those bonds to falter or fail.&lt;/div&gt;" />
