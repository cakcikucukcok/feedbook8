  <title>Time Is My Best Friend - Blue Throatwort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the personal account of the main characters life named Mary Anne. In the book Time is my Best Friend she is expressing her own testimony. Mary Anne begins the story by saying that time is what life is made up of, thus influences the cycle of life. She goes on to speak about her grandfathers ability to sense information through conscious and unconscious knowledge and from her understanding, though he had, what can be described as, precognition abilities, he could not turn around the hands of time to stop what must happen in a way that people have very little control over. He knew about Mary Annes coming and considered her a special person because she would be, from his interpretation, an individual with the external antennas or this could be described as a psychic gadget in her mind that gather and convert messages so that they can be understood. Grandfather and Mary Anne are able to share telepathy. 
They share the same visions as if they were of one mind, even though they are two distinct individuals being two generations apart. Mary Anne speaks of psychic experience as being every leap year whereby she meets mind to mind communication in which, from her deduction, psychic details are transmitted through psychic visions and dreams. She utters that she believes of a possible spiritual connection between her grandfather and her, made able by the two of them being twin flames, and they share a relationship on a spiritual realm. She trusts they are soulmates and thats how she learns he possesses paranormal abilities. Mary Anne voice about seeing visions of the life of a boy born in the past time as a son to a mother, who is in the present time a man approaching his fifties. However, the images are blurry and she cannot see clearly who his mother truly is. 
Once more, Grandfather and her share the same dreams whereby Grandfather is, as much, able to have visions of a boy and two mothers who were born in a time far back. Through the utilization of a combination of psychic talents, he successfully connects the boy of the past life to the existing man who is about to turn 50, living in the current life. He is, apart from that, satisfactorily effective in connecting whom the mother of the boy truly was from the visions of the two mothers he sees in his minds eye. These individuals were already deceased in the long-past century. Her grandfather, through what can be described as intuition, collects data of his last calling and he has helped her out by sending a telepathic communication on the information he assembled. On her own, every four years, she discovers a little more about his life and she finds his birth month. Whats more? Grandfather shows a positive attitude towards Mary Annes name, nonetheless, he had already had, what can be explained as, a clairvoyant-intuition of the name of the two mothers which appeared in his psychic vision. 
By Mary Annes parents giving her such a name, becomes a shocking coincidence when placed in comparison to the name in his psychic perception. Grandfather, in his own ways, refuses to accept whom the mother of the boy could possibly be, living in the current life when the indicator pointed towards Mary Anne, his granddaughter, based on her parents choice of her name, equivalent to as how it had appeared in Grandfathers vision  the image of a young girl born years after the man now turning 50. However, he comes to terms with his feelings of unacceptance and he conveys his mind to mind messages to Mary Anne to help her find out about the boy, and slowly try to understand who was his mother as well as what was the history to that time in the past which could be an unpleasant event which led to the rebirth, in Mary Annes confidence, which usually happens for souls to fulfill what has not been fulfilled in the last lifetime. 
Mary Anne speaks of her special ability to recall memories of her infant and toddler point of time in life, on the first words as well as the most impressive word to her grandfather which she said. Everything in nature had a meaning to her grandfather thus he understood what her stunning word meant. He concluded that Mary Anne had experienced an early childhood intuition and that his telepathic communication with her showed the first signs of success. Mary Anne takes the time to make clear an inference of hers, that afterlife communication was possible even after her grandfather had passed away. A near telepathic relation happens through an interconnectedness between them. This means that her deceased grandfather is furnished to communicate with her from his stand of spirit, despite the fact that his physical body had been enshrouded six feet under earth. Moreover, because of the tie of love that remained firm, it occurs as a result of an unanticipated inner inclination, whereby they communicate through telepathic messages. 
Again, her sixth sense gather and convert the messages that it can be understood, through clairvoyant-intuition. Mary Anne speaks that she meets the man approaching his 50s and he was exactly as in hers and grandfathers psychic vision and at that point in time of looking at him in the flesh, she felt the presence of a soul in her as if she was visited by the spirit of the deceased mother to the boy in the past. She keeps safe the secret her grandfather and Mary Anne shared, knowing that it was only meant for her to be led to solve the puzzle. Mary Anne utters, from her viewpoint, that her grandfather has also spoken to her through visible surrounding, that is, before she met a misfortune as he signalled she would. On top of that, she locates a suitable prayer for the reincarnated boy and in conclusion, she utters that a natural ability will always remain ones greatest strength." />
