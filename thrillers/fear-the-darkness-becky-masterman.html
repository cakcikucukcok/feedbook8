  <title>Fear the Darkness - Becky Masterman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s hard to recognize the devil when his hand is on your shoulder. That&#39;s because a psychopath is just a person before he becomes a headline....Psychopaths have preferences for Starbucks or Dunkin&#39; Donuts coffee, denim or linen, Dickens or...well, you get the point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex-FBI agent Brigid Quinn has seen more than her share of psychopaths. She is ready to put all that behind her, building a new life in Tucson with a husband, friends, and some nice quiet work as a private investigator. Sure, she could still kill a man half her age, but she now gets her martial arts practice by teaching self-defense at a women&#39;s shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it isn&#39;t that simple. When her sister-in-law dies, Brigid take in her seventeen-year-old niece, Gemma Kate. There has always been something unsettling about Gemma-Kate, but family is family. Which is fine, until Gemma-Kate starts taking an unhealthy interest in dissecting the local wildlife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Brigid agrees to help a local couple by investigating the death of their son--which also turns out not to be that simple. Her house isn&#39;t the sanctuary it used to be, and new dangers--including murder--seem to lurk everywhere. Brigid starts to wonder if there is anyone she can trust, or if the devil has simply moved closer to home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky Masterman&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Fear the Darkness &lt;/i&gt;is the masterful follow-up to the Edgar Award and CWA Gold Dagger finalist &lt;i&gt;Rage Against the Dying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
