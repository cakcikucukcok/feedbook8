      <meta name="description" content="Youngsville is normally a very quiet town. When a peaceful afternoon is shattered by the whine of police and ambulance sirens, no one seems to know the cause of the commotion.
Sixteen-year-old James is expecting a calm evening of television and delicious snacks as he arrives at the Caputos house to babysit their son, Danny, who is already in bed asleep. But as James sets the burglar alarm and settles in for the night with the remote in one hand, he has no idea that a serial killer is on the loose. When James views the news and a photo of the killer appears, he realizes it is the same man he has just seen standing across the street from the Caputos house. James night of terror is about to begin.
In this heart-pounding adventure, James suddenly realizes that he is not prepared for things that go bump in the night. When he finds Mr. Caputos hatchet outside the front door, sees strange reflections in a mirror, and feels fingers dig into his shoulder, James knows it is inevitablehe must confront either his overactive imagination or a murderer on a rampage." />
