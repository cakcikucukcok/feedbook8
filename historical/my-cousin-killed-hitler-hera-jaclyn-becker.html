  <title>My Cousin Killed Hitler - Hera Jaclyn Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1974 and the General Council of the Soviet Party has just received word that Marshal Georgi Zhukov is on his deathbed. With the goal of retrieving and destroying a journal that chronicles Zhukovs significant involvement in the historical events of World War II, secret police officers break into his home. However, the determination of a fallen hero should never be underestimated.
Zhukov, a little known Russian general and bona fide war hero who lives by the truth and, as a result, has been forced to live out most of his life in the unfairness of obscurity, knows his life is coming to an end. In an effort to pass the truth on to posterity, he assigns his beloved daughter, Tatyanna, the dangerous mission of revealing the contents of his journal to the world. While battling censorship and attempts on her life, Tatyanna holds true to her promise and eventually, everyone learns that it was Zhukov who masterminded the ingenious strategies that resulted in the defeat of Hitler. While facing the threat of being discovered by Stalin and imprisoned or murdered by a firing squad, Zhukov is the first to liberate a concentration camp while on his way to Berlin to kill Hitler and drag his body through the streets of Moscow. 
In this compelling novel based on true events, only time will tell if Zhukov&#39;s daughter will succeed in her mission or whether the truthful facts about World War II will be lost to the world along with a secret that will forever change the view of this war." />
