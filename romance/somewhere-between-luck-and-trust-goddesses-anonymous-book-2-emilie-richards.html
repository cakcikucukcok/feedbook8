  <title>Somewhere Between Luck and Trust (Goddesses Anonymous, Book 2) - Emilie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Christy Haviland served eight months in prison, giving birth behind bars to the child of the man who put her there and might yet destroy her. Now she&#39;s free again, but what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As smart as she is, a learning disability has kept her from learning to read. And that&#39;s the least of her hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Georgia Ferguson, talented educator, receives a mysterious charm bracelet that may help her find the mother who abandoned her at birth. Does she want to follow the clues, and if she does, can reticent Georgia reach out for help along the way?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Both women are standing at a crossroads, a place where unlikely unions can be formed. A place where two very different women might bridge the gap between generations and education, and together make tough choices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Somewhere between the townships called Luck and Trust, at a mountain cabin known as the Goddess House, two very different women may even, if they dare, find common ground and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
