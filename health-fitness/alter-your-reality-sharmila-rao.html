  <title>Alter Your Reality - Sharmila Rao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We , the human beings , are divine energy beings residing in a
physical body. We have an in-built system in our energy body which
connects us to the One divine source. Due to the deviation from the
universal laws/principles that govern life , the consciousness of
mankind fell gradually from the golden age of light to the iron age of
darkness . This resulted in the spiritual DNA being deactivated and
mankind lost his direct connection with the Divine. In the dark ages,
the psyche of mankind suffered great damage due to experiencing
immense pain and suffering. Now the cycle of human consciousness
is on a upward swing , ultimately leading to the golden age of light.
It is now possible for every man to re-establish his divine connection with the help of various energy healing techniques which are now
widely practiced and can be easily incorporated in our day to day
life. These divine healing energies have the ability to repair the
damaged energy field/ aura of man and help him to re-create a life
for himself which is a reflection of his dreams. For , reality that is
experienced by each man is nothing but a reflection of his thoughts/
emotions." />
