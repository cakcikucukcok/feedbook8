  <title>A Fool&#39;s Gold Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (A Fool&#39;s Gold Novel, Book 9.5) - Susan Mallery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A classic heartwarming tale for the holidays from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Susan Mallery&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cheer in &lt;strong&gt;Fool&#39;s Gold, California&lt;/strong&gt;, is bringing out the humbug in dancer Evie Stryker. An injury has forced her to return home to her estranged family. So she won&#39;t add to the awkward scenario by falling for the charms of her brother&#39;s best friend, no matter how tempting he is. When she&#39;s recruited to stage the winter festival, she vows to do as promised, then move on, anywhere but here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jaded lawyer Dante Jefferson is getting used to the town he now calls home, but the pounding of little dancers&#39; feet above his office is more than he can take. When he confronts their gorgeous teacher, he&#39;s unprepared for their searing attraction. Evie is his best friend&#39;s sister—off-limits unless he&#39;s willing to risk his heart. Dante has always believed that love is dangerous, but that was before he had to reckon with the magic of a certain small town, where miracles do seem to happen….&lt;/p&gt;
