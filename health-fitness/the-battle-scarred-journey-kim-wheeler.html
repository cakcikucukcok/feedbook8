  <title>The Battle Scarred Journey - Kim Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;A Gritty Personal Story of Self-Discovery and Recovery&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The Battle-Scarred Journey&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Kim Wheeler recounts his journey from the deep emotional pain of an abandoned and abused childhood, through challenges from severe physical injuries, drug and alcohol abuse, and ultimately to wholeness and healing with the help of a caring psychiatrist. He tells his story with passion, brutal honesty, and often humor -- hoping that others may find inspiration to face battles in their own journeys of self-discovery and recovery.&lt;strong&gt; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kim Wheeler was abandoned by his birth mother when he was born at University College Hospital, London in 1954. He lived in a children&amp;rsquo;s home until he was adopted at the age of six. His adoptive parents were emotionally distant, and his mother sometimes abused him verbally and physically. Happier times came at boarding school, but still there were emotional abuses due mainly to skin color, unknown parentage, and learning disabilities.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next thirty years Kim suffered from several physical injuries, survived meningitis, and, finally disabled with an incurable spine injury, was ordered to cease all types of manual work. Along the way he became dependent on prescription pain killers and abused illegal drugs and alcohol for years. Mental health issues and a complete breakdown soon ensued. Writing poems has helped Kim with his inner healing, and he shares with readers many of his verses about his darkest moments of vulnerability and psychological wounding.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Today,&amp;rsquo; Kim says, &amp;lsquo;I am a free and content man who enjoys nothing more than his rescue dogs, positive attitude, freedom.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
