  <title>Ready to Be Healed - William Berning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From opening the readers eyes to the deceitfulness of blind faith to untying the Gordian knot known as the battle of the sexes, the first half of this highly readable and spiritually encouraging book tackles head-on a series of false teachings being unwittingly propagated by many churches as &quot;biblical Christian beliefs.&quot;  Then, the second half of the book explores the Way of Freedom for the Christian as &lt;I&gt;God&lt;/I&gt; has intended it.  It shows how disregard for true biblical teaching on spiritual laws leaves the genuine Christian bent down and enslaved to spiritual forces of curses, castration and eternal condemnation  all of which await those who try to impress God through their &lt;I&gt;own&lt;/I&gt; righteousness.  &lt;P&gt;Every chapter brings Gods Word, rightly divided and rightly applied, against common church teachings that have brought misery and pain into the Christian experience.  And every chapter brings the soothing, cleansing balm of Gods Truth to every weary and heavy-laden believer  restoration for the soul of every genuine Christian who is &lt;I&gt;Ready To Be Healed!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
