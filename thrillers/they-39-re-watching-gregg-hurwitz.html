  <title>They&#39;re Watching - Gregg Hurwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Riveting, emotionally rich, original, and beautifully written, this book kept me up too late reading, had me sneaking in pages the next day. &lt;/i&gt;They&#39;re Watching &lt;i&gt;reminded me what it&#39;s like to be in the thrall of a great story: helpless until the end, loving every minute of it.&quot;--Lisa Unger, &lt;/i&gt;New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;/i&gt;Die for You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Patrick Davis is a man with troubles. First his Hollywood dreams crumble and then his storybook marriage hits a snag. Now, DVDs start being delivered to his house--DVDs which show that someone is watching him and his wife, that the two of them are being stalked and recorded by cameras hidden in their house. Then the e-mails start, and someone offers to fix everything, to take the mess his life has become and make it all right. Patrick figures it&#39;s the offer of a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;But Patrick couldn&#39;t be more wrong. With every step he falls deeper into a web of intrigue that threatens everything he values in this world. Before he knows it, he&#39;s in and in deep--and his only escape is to outwit and outplay his unseen opponents at their own game.&lt;/p&gt;" />
