  <title>The Force of Creation, Salvation and Judgement - Roger W. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carl Sagan, a prominent American astrophysicist and philosopher said, Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. The Bible does just that! The Scriptures are self revealing, self interpreting and self dramatic. Questions  about the origin and foundation of the universe and the earth continue to confound the paleontologist, the astrophysicist, and even the theologian. While many mysteries of the universe are being progressively unlocked in our age of technological advances and discoveries, questions begging definitive resolutions still remain unanswered. Such questions posed are: Why and how did the dinosaur become extinct? What became of Eden, the garden of God? Did Atlantis really exist and how was it destroyed? What is the newest planet in our solar system and where did it come from?  Surprisingly, definitive resolutions to these questions and more  are contained within the pages of the Bible in ofttimes dramatic detail, translated into all languages. Only through divine inspiration can the extraordinary information penned by the prophets of old confirm the many wonders of the universe and the world that have come to light in our modern age of scientific exploration and             discovery. God frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish ( Isaiah 44:25 )." />
