      <meta name="description" content="What happens when Eveline Paine becomes the recipient of her husbands estate?  The Spirit of Wallace Paine is the sequel to The House of Many Windows that described the life of Wallace Paine and his sociopathic behavior.  Eveline, now the owner of his companies, discovers the full extent of his corrupt business practices.  The story takes place during The Roaring Twenties, a period in American history, when out-of-control behaviors in business and pleasure were the norm.  Eveline manipulates the men in her business affairs, unbeknown to them, to uncover the corrupt underworld of Prohibition and Foreign Exchange Programs.  Mrs. Paine is bombarded by the past when her friend finds and gives her a locked black box that belonged to her late husband.  Eveline steps in to reconstruct businesses while demolishing people and their reputations.  She is a product of the Womens Rights Movement and a Flapper who utilizes her experiences and training to put men in their place while she moves to the top of the business world.  After coming to terms with her new life, Eveline and her friend, Winston, move to Miami.  During the hurricane of 1929, an anonymous letter is delivered to her at the Biltmore Hotel from underworld law enforcers having an unforeseen impact on her plans for the future." />
