  <title>Westin Family Ties (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Open Sky Ranch, Book 3) - Alice Sharpe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Cody Westin had been a man on a mission since the moment his wife, Cassie, walked away under a cloud of secrecy. She had her reasons, but a Westin never gives up without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So when, after six long months, he was reunited with the woman he&#39;d sworn to love, honor and cherish, it was her very pregnant belly and the fact that she&#39;d been accused of unspeakable crimes that made him realize just how much had changed. Knowing she&#39;d be safer by his side, they headed back to Wyoming and the life Cassie seemed desperate to leave behind. Unfortunately, danger followed, and now Cody not only had a marriage to protect, but the lives of those who mattered most. Would the trouble bring them closer together–or tear their newfound family apart?&lt;/p&gt;
