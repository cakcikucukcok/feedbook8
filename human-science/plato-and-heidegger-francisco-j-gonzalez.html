  <title>Plato and Heidegger - Francisco J. Gonzalez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a critique of Heidegger that respects his path of thinking, Francisco Gonzalez looks at the ways in which Heidegger engaged with Plato&amp;rsquo;s thought over the course of his career and concludes that, owing to intrinsic requirements of Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s own philosophy, he missed an opportunity to conduct a real dialogue with Plato that would have been philosophically fruitful for us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining in detail early texts of Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s reading of Plato that have only recently come to light, Gonzalez, in parts 1 and 2, shows there to be certain affinities between Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s and Plato&amp;rsquo;s thought that were obscured in his 1942 essay &amp;ldquo;Plato&amp;rsquo;s Doctrine of Truth,&amp;rdquo; on which scholars have exclusively relied in interpreting what Heidegger had to say about Plato. This more nuanced reading, in turn, helps Gonzalez provide in part 3 an account of Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s later writings that highlights the ways in which Heidegger, in repudiating the kind of metaphysics he associated with Plato, took a direction away from dialectic and dialogue that left him unable to pursue those affinities that could have enriched Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s own philosophy as well as Plato&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;ldquo;A genuine dialogue with Plato,&amp;rdquo; Gonzalez argues, &amp;ldquo;would have forced [Heidegger] to go in certain directions where he did not want to go and could not go without his own thinking undergoing a radical transformation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
