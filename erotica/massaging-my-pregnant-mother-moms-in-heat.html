  <title>Massaging My Pregnant Mother - Moms In Heat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being pregnant was hard on mom. At 38, this was likely her last. So, when she called and said she needed a massage, I raced over as quick as I could.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I soon learned, when pregnant, sometimes modesty goes out the window. Mom honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t care that I saw her pregnant, naked body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, she encouraged it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many advantages to living next door to my mother. One of them became apparent yesterday when dad had been gone on a fishing trip with his brother, and mom - 8-months heavily pregnant - started having some aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She called me over and asked me to pick her up a bottle of Tylenol. But I wondered if there was anything more that I could do to help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; she smiled weakly, &amp;quot;perhaps give your momma a nice massage?&amp;quot; She suggested rather coyly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure!&amp;quot; I piped up. Mom had always been a looker, but now that she was 38 and preggers, with that nice, motherly glow about her, she looked like a fucking doll.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh thank you!&amp;quot; Her shoulders sagged in relief and a smile crept across her motherly face. &amp;quot;Normally I&amp;#39;d ask your father, but he&amp;#39;s with Uncle Bill.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom may have been getting up there in years (to 20-year-old me, anyway), but she had kept her svelte, hourglass figure. I&amp;#39;d noticed over the years that her hips had widened, her breasts had grown and her face had matured.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, when I was offered the chance to massage that hot MILF, I (and my cock) jumped at the chance. Maybe it was only a neck massage, but just being able to touch my mother&amp;#39;s soft flesh was a dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I grabbed a bottle of massage oil and set to work massaging her neck and shoulders. I was surprised when I came back in that mom had taken off her blouse, leaving only her bra and panties covering her delicious body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom?&amp;quot; I stared, open-mouthed at her taut belly and jutting, bra-covered breasts. They were so large that they strained the seams of the fabric. At least half of her breast cleavage was exposed and I could see thick, blue veins criss-crossing her flesh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shrugged. &amp;quot;I just thought you&amp;#39;d be able to do a better job if nothing was in your way. Besides,&amp;quot; she giggled, &amp;quot;when you get this far along, modesty goes out the window. Just don&amp;#39;t tell your father, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded. &amp;quot;Sure.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I quickly set about my task of relieving my mother of her aches and pains. But I couldn&amp;#39;t stop staring. She was sitting down on the sofa and I was standing behind her and I had a perfect angle right down her bra. It was such a great angle that I could see her fat, milky, motherly nipples." />
