  <title>Hey! Let&#39;s Celebrate You. Who, Me? Yes, You - Mary-Linda Steed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hey! Lets celebrate you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are special, you are unique, and inside of you are talents and gifts that are needed on this Earth. You were created to fulfill a special plan that God preplanned before you were born. Just think, if Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Picasso, and da Vinci never discovered their gifts and talents, we would have missed out big time. Thank God first for giving those gifts and talents. Whatever gifts and talents are in us were meant to be given away to bless others. Something as simple as a smile or a word of encouragement given can bless the world. Lets Celebrate You will give you insight into seeing and learning to appreciate your uniqueness without it you will never allow what God has put in you to flow out of you. Lets Celebrate You will help you see how important it is to kick out discouragement; it is a dream killer. Jesus said the kingdom of God has suffered violence and the violent take it by force. For your dreams to be fulfilled, you will have to be violent against discouragement. It may feel like all the forces of hell are coming against you just because you are trying to give birth to your dream. Every great dream has had to overcome great opposition and discouragement to win.&lt;/p&gt;" />
