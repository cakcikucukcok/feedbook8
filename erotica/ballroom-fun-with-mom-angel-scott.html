  <title>Ballroom Fun With Mom - Angel Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Come join the fun at a ballroom party! Fancy dresses, alcohol, and dancing is only part of the fun. Two different ladies ask their sons to meet them at the party. Covering up their faces help to get away with just about everything!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. I will take a quick shower. Please don&amp;rsquo;t leave yet. I want to ask you for a favor.&amp;rdquo; Sarah said as she climbed off the bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you just tell me before you get into the shower?&amp;rdquo; Seth asked as his light brown, thin, eyebrow moved upward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fine. My date canceled on me. I got invited to a ballroom party. I even bought a dress for the occasion. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my two-hundred bucks to go to waste. Would you be willing to go with me to the party?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Eh. Sounds boring, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There will be lots of beer, snacks, and dancing. Please!&amp;rdquo; Sarah pleaded. She put her hands together as you would do for praying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seth rolled his dark blue eyes. &amp;ldquo;Fine. But you owe me, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I will make it up too you. I promise. Do you need a suit?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I got one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Great! I will pick you up at seven then.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay. Sounds good. I need to head out. I promised some of the guys that I would go to the bar with them for a little while.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay just don&amp;rsquo;t forget about me,&amp;rdquo; Sarah said as she walked closer to her son. When she reached him, she grabbed onto his full body. She wrapped her arms around her son and then leaned in. She kissed him with passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The kiss made Seth feel weak in the knees. He would not ever forget his mom. &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t forget about you, momma. I&amp;rsquo;m a momma&amp;rsquo;s boy. Remember?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I remember. I always feel happy to know that you&amp;rsquo;re my boy. See you in a couple of hours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Bye, momma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Bye son.&amp;rdquo; She let go of her son and watched him leave. After that, she smiled brightly as she climbed the stairs to the bathroom. She headed to the shower and climbed in. The water felt cold so Sarah waited for the water to warm up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It took several moments to warm up. As she waited for the water to warm up, Sarah sang out loud. She loved singing and dancing. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait until her night started. The water finally felt warm enough, so Sarah stood underneath the warm water. She washed her hair first, and then her body. When the shower finished, Sarah grabbed a wine cooler from the fridge. Drinking would calm the nervousness that she started to feel as the time grew closer to the party. While drinking, Sarah found a movie to watch until it would be time to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seth headed to the local bar just as he promised he would. All his buddies held up their beer as he walked in. He nodded and smiled happily. He headed over to the bar and waited for the lady to finish up with a customer. Finally, Seth could order a Rum and Coke. When he got his drink, he paid the lady and waited for money back. The lady practically ran over to the cash register. The lady typed in numbers and then put the money in her hand. She ran back over by Seth and handed him back some change. A tip jar stood not far from Seth, so he put two bucks in for the lady. Fast service deserves a tip. Seth walked over to his buddies and sat down next to Henry. Seth enjoyed his drink and the good conversation with his pals. Time started to fly by while Seth enjoyed a few drinks." />
