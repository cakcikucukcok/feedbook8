      <meta name="description" content="Aaron Recess is a glazier for Cape Verdean Glass. Until his co-worker introduces him to cocaine, weed is the only drug that Aaron does. He snorts the cocaine in his frontroom  while being watched by Danielle, a firebrand woman with frightening normalcy despite her otherworldly evilness. 
As a result of his descent into the proverbial silent aquamarine depths of a watery world, Aarons nose undergoes a transformation that a lowlife makes after he supplied the fatal drug dose to a woman Aaron has never met. 
Detailed with a lipsticked harridan, biracial litterbug, hopped-up teetotaler, German spelunker, and more, Villains Always Make Mistakes shadows Aaron in real time during his trailblazing misadventure to find out why Danielle is a wolf in sheeps clothing." />
