  <title>Breaking Free - Christi Ahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was at six years old that Spirit first appeared to Christi. Fear gripped her life from a young age, and Spirit wasnt the only thing scaring her. She knew that not everyone saw Spirit the way she did, and without direction and support, she refused Spirits call until she was twenty-three years old. The only answer was to embrace her true calling as a psychic visionary, medium, and healer.
With life taking her to various locations, it was often difficult to make new friends and start over. The one constant has always been for her to discover insightful ways to help people. Nothing would prepare her for her toughest work in the criminal justice field as a probation and parole officer.
Riddled with anxiety, depression, and a lack of boundaries as an empath, she knew she could no longer ignore her divine purpose and continue in the criminal justice field.
After years of providing inspiration, instruction, and advice to others, it has culminated in Breaking Free: From Probation Officer to Psychic Medium. Christis message is to help us understand that by listening to our own divine guidance and understanding our fear and anxiety, we can all live the amazing lives our soul knows from birth." />
