  <title>The Deadly Seeker Returns - Bert Millspaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Deadly Seeker Returns is a fast action sci fi novel sequel of The Deadly Seeker where a biochemical humanoid robot ravished the ranches of Idaho and Montana seeking a Venusian child abducted by a Soviet space probe. The novel takes the next step beyond the probe that infuriated the Venusians enough to send a space craft to Earth manned by a Deadly Seeker.  
The Deadly Seeker Returns follows a rebellion within the under surface community on the planet Venus by a group of biochemical robots where one escapes in a spaceship and crashes into Earth on Californias Saddleback Mountain. The rebellious creature goes on a killing spree, terrorizing the county, as it sets up beacons to guide his followers to Earth.
After the humanoid beast hideously kills his brother, State Park Ranger Brad Evans and a member of his staff, Ranger Julie Adams, resolve to avenge his death. Brad is motivated by his mentor, a university professor, and his mothers silver medallion found on his dead brother. Heeding kind words of his mentor, Brad turns remorse and anger into willpower and determination. Brad and Julie follow a trail of killings that takes them through the cities, foothills, canyons, and mountains of Orange County California, discovering romance along the way.  
With the help of a pudgy deputy, an Air Force colonel, and the U.S. Forest Service, they corner the creature in a fiery battle on a remote tree covered mountain top. The significance of the medallion and the motivation of his mentor lead Brad toward the annihilation of the Deadly Seeker and further his closeness to and affection for Julie." />
