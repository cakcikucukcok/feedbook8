  <title>Surviving Murder - Lilan Baltz Starford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surviving Murder&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by Lilan Baltz Starford&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do bad things happen to innocent people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her sailboat in Cape Cod, Susan Kelly barely escapes death from a murderous attack. She finds she has accidentally recorded a secret conversation that could ruin a prominent US Senator and reach high into the CIA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desperate for a place to hide, she chooses the world of the homeless. Known now as Molly Malone, events take her to Richmond, Virginia. Her enemies discover she is alive, and there is another attempt to kill her. With the help of friends and strangers, she flees to Lewisburg, West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Befriended by former moonshiners there, she is helped to escape and hide in the mountains. However, the handsome sheriff of Greenbrier County moves her heart. Thinking she is safe, she takes one too many risks and is captured. They will surely murder her now. &lt;/p&gt;" />
