  <title>Harness the Power of Your Laugh! - Lynda Andrews, Dr Madan Kataria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harness the Power of Your Laugh! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news! You can laugh every day, no matter what is happening in the world. Even if you are very busy with life, you only need a few minutes a day, and you will discover that laughing is like a nourishing food. We need to actively and consciously laugh every day to give our bodies the best opportunity to grow strongly, happily, and healthily. The best news is that laughing is a deep-breathing technique. Much scientific research has been done over recent years on cell oxygenation and disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel Prize winner Dr Otto Warburg, president of the Institute of Cell Physiology, says: 
Deep breathing techniques increase oxygen to the cells and are the most important factors in living a disease-free and energetic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Sheldon Hendler, MD, medical researcher in cell oxygenation, says: 
Oxygenation through deep breathing boosts the immune system and can rid the body of chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a difference in your life and for those you love by practicing and sharing the playful Laughter Yoga exercises in this book. Discover the joy of laughing every day, and welcome to our global laughter family!&lt;/p&gt;" />
