  <title>Special Handball Practice 2 - Step-by-step training of successful offense strategies against the 6-0 defense system - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These training units elaborate initial actions against the 6-0 defense system as well as variable options for continued playing. The first three training units teach the tactical basics of playing against the 6-0 defense on an individual and a small-group basis. This includes the dynamic piston movement with breaking through decisions as well as the basics of crossing movements and team play with the pivot. The subsequent three training units introduce crossing of the center back with the wing player as an initial action and provide three more options for the team to overcome the defense through continued playing.
This book contains the following training units:
Basics of the piston movement
This training unit focuses on developing the basics of the piston movement. Following warm-up and a coordination run, the players develop the basics of the piston movement step by step during the subsequent ball familiarization and a piston movement team exercise. The goalkeeper warm-up shooting is characterized by piston movements/counter piston movements and a subsequent shot at the goal. In a small group exercise, the players further develop the piston movement, while the team exercise focuses on training the piston movement 5-on-5. A sprint contest completes this training unit.
Basics of the crossing movement
The objective of this training unit is to develop simple crossing moves. Following warm-up and a coordination run that includes reactions to changing situations, the players develop simple crossing moves during the ball familiarization exercise. In the subsequent goalkeeper warm-up shooting exercise, the crossing moves will be extended by a shot at the goal. Step by step, the players develop a crossing move with a subsequent shot from the back positions until finally, they are able to do two consecutive crossing moves. During the 6-on-6 final game, the players implement what they practiced before.
Interacting with the pivot
This training unit focuses on the interaction of the back position players with the pivot. Following a warm-up game and a ball familiarization exercise, the players practice the interaction with the pivot during the goalkeeper warm-up shooting. In the two subsequent exercises, the players further develop and practice the interaction step by step. A sprint contest completes this training unit.
Long crossing of the center back and the wing player as initial action – Part 1
This training unit focuses on the development of a simple initial action with crossing of the center back and the wing player. Following a short warm-up game, the players gradually develop the initial action during the ball familiarization phase. After the goalkeeper warm-up shooting, there are two team exercises during which the players practice the running moves of the initial action as well as several options for continued playing and variants. A closing game completes this training unit.
Long crossing of the center back and the wing player as initial action – Part 2
In this training unit, the players gradually further develop the initial action of the previous training unit and practice further possible solutions. Following a short warm-up game, the players develop the running paths during the ball familiarization phase. The goalkeeper warm-up shooting includes a simple crossing move with a subsequent shot at the goal. During two team exercises, the players practice the different playing options that are to be implemented in the subsequent closing game.
Long crossing of the center back and the wing player as initial action – Part 3
In this training unit, the players take up the initial action of the two previous training units and practice further possible solutions. Following warm-up with a coordination run, the players develop an additional crossing move during the ball familiarization exercise and the goalkeeper warm-up shooting. The players further develop this step by step in a series of shots. In a team exercise, the players combine the new crossing move with the initial action they practiced before and eventually implement both in a 6-on-6 game. A sprint contest completes this training unit." />
