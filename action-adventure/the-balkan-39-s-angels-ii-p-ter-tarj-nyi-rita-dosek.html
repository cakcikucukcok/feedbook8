  <title>The Balkan&#39;s Angels Ii - Péter Tarjányi, Rita Dosek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is mere months after Toms capture of the Serbian ex-president. He and his unit built a strong bond over the course of their mission, but it is time for them to part ways since the job is done. The reward money helps, and Tom is prepared to ?nally retire in style. But the Serbian under-world that assisted in the presidents capture now feels a need for revenge. They want payback for the violence Toms unit brought to their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Toms unit is on the chopping block. An international manhunt is launched to ?nd Tom and the rest of his team. The ma?a doesnt want them in a court of law, however; they want them dead. Toms own country is of no help, as he is now considered a war criminal of a di?erent kinda guilty bounty hunter. Now, the team must get back together in order to save their lives and clear their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are quite different now for the whole unit. For the ?rst time in his long, proud career, Tom now ?nds himself on the wrong side of the lawand it will take a lot more than friendly conversation to get out of Europe alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
