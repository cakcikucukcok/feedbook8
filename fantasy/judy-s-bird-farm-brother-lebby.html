  <title>Judy’S Bird Farm - Brother Lebby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt; Judys Bird Farm &lt;/i&gt; is the tale of bird kingdom, and the birds who were protected from annihilation by Judy Paulina, a kind-hearted woman. Shunned by the rest of the animal kingdom, the birds found a spiritual leader in Judy, whom they called JP. She shared her belief in the all-powerful, miracle-working, supreme-being called Maha-Waa. However, her loving leadership was short-lived and she died suddenly soon after becoming their leader.
	As the birds struggle for their survival, they become embroiled in a bitter conflict with their arch-enemyGatorade the lion and the citizens of Animal Kingdom. Without their leader, the birds must rely only on their loving memories of JP and her lessons to serve them well as they fight for their freedom. 
This story is an amalgam of religion, politics, history, and government, all beautifully and curiously interwoven. A fable that offers an unflinching look at what happens when there is great power without great, spiritual responsibility. The struggles that the Bird Nation encounters are reminiscent of the early stories of Christianity. &lt;i&gt;Judys Bird Farm &lt;/i&gt; offers a reminder that the life well-lived can make the different between success and failure" />
