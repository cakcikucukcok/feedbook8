  <title>Today Things Would Be Different. - Polly Dobell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah and Nathan grew up together playing in the estate fields, but their friendship could go no further as she was the daughter of a worker and he was the masters son. But unbeknownst to her family, Sarahs friends helped the relationship develop to love, and they demonstrated that love in the bluebell wood one spring.
But his family would not accept the consequences and took matters into their own hands, which would leave Sarah with having to keep a lifelong secret. Could she do the right thing?
It is a story of how family ties and close friendships are needed by us all to cope with what life deals us and how life-changing decisions could affect us all." />
