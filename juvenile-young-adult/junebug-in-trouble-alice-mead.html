  <title>Junebug in Trouble - Alice Mead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Junebug hasn&#39;t seen his friend Robert since the family moved from their housing project in May. It&#39;s Labor Day weekend, reunion time, and Mama, Tasha, Harriet, and Junebug are off to the beach. Robert is there, but so is Trevor, another boy from the project. Trevor is a gang member; Trevor has a gun. With Junebug gone, Trevor has easily befriended Robert. Robert might even join Trevor&#39;s gang, the Rex. How can Junebug stop him? At the same time, Junebug wonders about his own father, who&#39;s been imprisoned for more than six years. Junebug longs to know him, to know that he&#39;s innocent - and that if he&#39;s not, Junebug won&#39;t necessarily turn out like him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the spunk with which he made his dream come true in Junebug and assimilated a whole new life in Junebug and the Reverend, Alice Mead&#39;s ten-year-old hero sets out to save his friend and understand his father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Junebug in Trouble&lt;/i&gt; is a 2003 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
