  <title>Daddy&#39;s Promise - Brendan T. Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was with her twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for the last ten months of her life. The conversations we had were priceless. The promises I made to her I am still fulfilling. Dawn definitely made me a stronger person. She taught me so many things about life, about myself, but also about others. 
After she was diagnosed, Dawn saw things as they were and not as she wished them to be, and slowly but surely she began putting things in order. 
Yes, this cancer is going to end my life here on earth several years sooner than if I didnt have it. Though it wont take away what I have. I have a loving father and best friend. I have Cathy, my wonderful mother by marriage. I have my mother and Kristie who I love so very much. I have the two most beautiful children in the world in Tyler and Jordan. 
I have peace with God and myself. I also have something that is so important to me: I have love from all those I just mentioned. They love me. So you see, cancer didnt win. It can never take what I have. 
Please understand that I havent given up on a miracle nor have I given up on life here on earth. I wont live my life waiting on a miracle. Im going to live my life as if I dont need a miracle. I wont live my life in fear of death. Im going to live my life as if I have nothing to fear. Yes, I will do whatever it takes to live. Im going to do my best to do what it takes to be happy not depressed. So yes, I hate that I have cancer, although I love my life and those who are in it and make it what it is." />
