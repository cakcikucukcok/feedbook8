          &lt;strong&gt;Nobody ever ignores Dr. John McIntyre Thorn&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the operating room he&#39;s king. His skill as a veterinary surgeon and his devotion to his four-legged patients are legendary. Unfortunately, his bedside manner with their owners needs a little work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Kit Lockhart brings her Corgi to the clinic for treatment, Mac is scathing in his criticism. Why had she waited so long to get the little dog treated? Only when Kit turns to face him and asks him to repeat his words does he realize she can&#39;t hear.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the first time, Mac can&#39;t raise his voice to get his way. Now he has to listen. And Kit and her young daughter have a lot to teach him.&lt;/p&gt;
