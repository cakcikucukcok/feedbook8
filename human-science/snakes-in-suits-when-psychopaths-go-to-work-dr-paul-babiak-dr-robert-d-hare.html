Together, they have developed the B-Scan 360, a research tool designed specifically for business professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Babiak and Dr. Hare reveal the secret lives of psychopaths, explain the ways in which they manipulate and deceive, and help you to see through their games. The rapid pace of today&amp;#8217;s corporate environment provides the perfect breeding ground for these &quot;snakes in suits&quot; and this newly revised and updated classic gives you the insight, information, and power to protect yourself and your company before it&amp;#8217;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
