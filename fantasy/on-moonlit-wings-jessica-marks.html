This Tablet signified the end of the endless battles, the end of the war, the beginning of peace, if only hed been able to finish this mission. Instead, hed dropped it in the middle of the Amazonhed failed. 
25 year old Domica Gordon has worked for the Smithsonian as an Archeologist for two years, and never once was she allowed to go excavating on her own. However, after telling her boss to shove it, shes now in the Amazon. Her mission is to find a Tablet that can predict catastrophic events. Though shes up for an adventure, nothing could have prepared her for whats to come.
Intercepting Domica on her mission to get the Tablet is Fris first issue, his secondkeeping his feelings for a human at bay. With the long trip up river, the two unsuspecting soul mates face Wandigas, Windegos and Tara Devils at every corner, and a growing attraction that could kill them both. 
With secrets revealed, death imminent, and a love so strong that the choices made to protect it are unforgivable. Will Fris be able to make the choice between saving his love and condemning the world or will he sacrifice his only mate, the only one to bare his children, in order to save the human race?" />
