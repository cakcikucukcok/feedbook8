  <title>The Pavlac Legacy - Herman Edel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Pavlac Legacy is an adventure based on the true facts of a journey that reaches out to the people of Prague, Berlin, London, New York, Boston, Washington, Cincinnati, and finally, those of Aspen, Colorado.&lt;p&gt;
In 1865, a Torah is created by a poor scribe and his young son. It is done at the behest of a fellow countryman, the very wealthy and important Prague resident, David Pavlac. This great gift first binds the two families and then, through the years, involves people of many religious persuasions, people of royalty, people of great wealth, and the poorest of people.&lt;p&gt; 
Young loves blossom, and later, old loves provide the needed strength to keep moving forward. Wars and hatred and death slowly, but relentlessly, change the lives of all in an ever growing circle of people. Tears vie with laughter as each new adversity unfolds.
The ability to rise and fight, finds few with the courage to stand and battle. But others, be they young or old, emerge who accept the challenge.&lt;p&gt; 
The 1865 creation finds its ultimate home in the mountains of Aspen, and with that, comes survival and a sense of future hope." />
