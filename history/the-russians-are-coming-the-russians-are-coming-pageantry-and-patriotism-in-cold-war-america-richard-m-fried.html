  <title>The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!: Pageantry and Patriotism in Cold-War America - Richard M. Fried</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explores a widely lived yet little remembered facet of Americas cultural and political history: the Cold War as experienced at the grassroots level. Here, Fried traces the cresting of modern patriotic observance during World War II and then shows how patriotic and civic activists afterwards labored to recreate a remembered unity and commitment in the tension-filled Cold War era. A variety of national and local entities mounted campaigns to sell America to the Americans through rededication celebrations like Know Your America Week and Freedom Week. The American Heritage Foundation wheeled out the Freedom Train, which carried seminal documents of the nations past to railroad depots across the US. Fried revisits the 1950 Communist invasion of Mosinee, Wisconsin, when ersatz Stalinists harassed and bullied citizens and the towns eateries served only potato soup and black bread. He also depicts the creation and inauguration of new patriotic events like Loyalty Day and Armed Forces Day.  Meticulously researched, this book recreates a colorful, sometimes comical, and always revealing dimension of our history." />
