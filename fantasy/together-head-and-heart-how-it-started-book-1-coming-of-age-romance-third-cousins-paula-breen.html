  <title>Together Head and Heart - How it Started (Book 1) Coming of Age Romance - Third Cousins, Paula Breen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Melisa hasn&#39;t seen her father since he moved to England. She hasn&#39;t wanted to. He broke her mother’s heart and left them to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives. He’s getting married, though, and he’s insisting that she’s there for his special day. Melisa is sure that the nightmare will begin from the moment she gets on the plane. She doesn&#39;t even like flying. Things aren&#39;t quite as dark as they seem, though, when the hottest guy she’s ever seen sits down next to her with a book in his hand. They&#39;ve got ten hours before they land. They&#39;re perfect strangers. They&#39;re taking off on an unplanned adventure together, but when turbulence strikes will they find themselves suffering through a crash landing?" />
