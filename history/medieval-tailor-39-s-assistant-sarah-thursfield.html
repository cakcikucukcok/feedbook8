  <title>Medieval Tailor&#39;s Assistant - Sarah Thursfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Medieval Tailor&#39;s Assistant is the standard work for both amateurs and professionals wishing to re-create the clothing of the Medieval era for historical interpretation or drama. This new edition extends its range with details of fitting different figures and many more patterns for main garments and accessories from 1100 to 1480. It includes simple instructions for plain garments, as well as more complex patterns and adaptations for experienced sewers. Advice on planning outfits and materials to use is given along with a range of projects and alternative designs, from undergarments to outer wear. Early and later tailoring methods are also covered within the period. There are clear line drawings, pattern diagrams and layouts and over eighty full-colour photographs that show the garments as working outfits. The garments are presented with brief notes on their historical background in three mainlayers, underwear, main garments and outer garments for men, women and children. There is a section on &#39;How to use the book&#39; with detailed instructions on techniques, planning, materials and, in particular, cutting methods from 1100. In this new edition there are over 400 line illustrations and a further 80 colour photographs as well as patterns for 151 garments and accessories." />
