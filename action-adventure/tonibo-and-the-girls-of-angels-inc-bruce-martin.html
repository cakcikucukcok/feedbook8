  <title>Tonibo and the Girls of Angels, Inc. - Bruce Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are secret government agents among us. During the day, they might buy groceries. Maybe they do laundry at the Laundromat down the street. Maybe they go to your local gym and run on a treadmill. To the untrained eye, they are regular American citizens  but they take their jobs seriously. At night, they break through advanced building security. They hack the computers of terrorists, and they might even kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet the Angelsfour beautiful women by day and four tough government spies by night. Theres the fearless leader, ToniBo, an ex-Navy Seal. Miki is a five-foot-tall ex-Green Beret who gives out bruises as fast as you can blow a kiss. CeeCee is an ex-Ranger communications officer and sniper, while Iris is an ex-Special Operations demolition expert and Top Gun pilot. Together, they form a team thats practically unbeatableall while doing their best to live semi-normal lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, their country needs them. Bloodthirsty neo-Nazi racists are plotting to take down the president of the United States. They are angered that a less-than-pureblood is running their country, and it has to stop. These backwoods boys didnt count on the Angels, though, and their kidnapping plot is about to get a lot more difficult when four brave women help to save the life of our countrys commander-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;" />
