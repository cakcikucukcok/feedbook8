  <title>Home Made Summer - Yvette van Boven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ome Made&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Home Made Winter&lt;/i&gt; blew readers away with their stunning packages, delicious recipes, beautiful photos, step-by-step instructions, and hand-drawn artwork throughout. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Home Made Summer&lt;/i&gt;, Yvette van Boven takes the same signature approach and presents her absolute favorite recipes for spring and summer. Inspired by her childhood in Ireland and her frequent sojourns in France, van Boven has created a collection of recipes that will truly inspire you to step into the kitchen. Using seasonal ingredients, such as freshly picked apples and berries, delicate summer lettuces and fresh herbs, she presents recipes for Breakfast, Brunch &amp; Lunch, Snacks, Beverages, Appetizers, and Dessert.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Praise for Home Made Summer:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Think of van Boven as the activities director of your own culinary summer camp . . . &lt;i&gt;Home Made Summer&lt;/i&gt; is a happy book, fun to look at, fun to read. It&#39;s downright frivolous, in fact. And that&#39;s what summer is all about.+?&lt;br&gt;
-- &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In the last two years, she has published three cookbooks, &lt;i&gt;Home Made&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Home Made Winter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Home Made Summer&lt;/i&gt;, that exemplify the indie spirit: They&#39;re filled with her illustrations and do-it-yourself recipes, like hand-cranked ice cream, from-scratch mustards and Dutch-style beef sausages and croquettes.+? --&lt;i&gt;Food &amp; Wine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Flipping through the pages feels a bit like stepping into a fantasy land, one with jars and jars of citrusy-tomato mayonnaise awaiting crab cakes and stacks of powdered sugar-dusted &#39;ultimate puffy pancakes&#39; (topped with crème fraîche and berries in&lt;br&gt;
lieu of syrup).+?Â  --&lt;i&gt;LA Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;It&#39;s tough to overlook the stunning savory dishes and focus on dessert, but dessert does not disappoint. We&#39;ve chosen recipes that aim to mimic van Boven&#39;s aesthetic: making the most of what&#39;s freshest, and sharing it with those you love.+? --&lt;i&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
