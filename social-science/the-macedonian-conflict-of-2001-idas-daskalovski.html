      <meta name="description" content="Daskalovski, among the most promising political scientists from Skopje/Macedonia, also running a think-tank in this country (Centre for Research and Policy Making – CRPM), presents in this paper the background, the theatre, the action and the actors of the Macedonian conflict of 2001 between Macedonians and Macedonian Albanians. It describes excellently the role of the European Union, which for the first time had an application case of Common Foreign Policy, and of the United States, as well as of the OSCE, and the interaction between all of them. Also, the Macedonian protagonists are well painted, who finally managed to settle the conflict by changing the Constitution.This Paper is an excellent case study for all who want to become aware of conflict backgrounds in the Balkan, and a way to settle them, not only in Macedonia, but also in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as in Albania. Furthermore, it is a sometimes thrilling attempt to write present history about a conflict which is only some few years ago." />
