  <title>The Passage - Michael Hurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DO YOU BELIEVE IN EVERLASTING LOVE?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jay Danforth Fitzgerald, known as &amp;ldquo;Fitz&amp;rdquo; to his few remaining friends, has learned from long and painful experience that there is no such thing as love that lasts. A failed an aging stockbroker full of angst and self-loathing, he fritters away his nights in Tiddly&amp;rsquo;s Bar and his days aboard a derelict sailboat stuck in the mud of Charleston Harbor. But when he meets a much younger woman named Gemma, his world changes forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Award-winning author Michael Hurley has crafted a tale for the ages about the love we leave behind and the longing that fills our hearts for what might have been. When Fitz resolves to make a reckless solo passage to Ireland in a last-ditch grab for salvation, Gemma secretly stows aboard. The story of Gemma and Fitz plays out on the dramatic stage of the North Atlantic, on a boat bound toward the past Fitz cannot forget and a future he cannot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;imagine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
