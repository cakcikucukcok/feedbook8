  <title>His Just Desserts - John Raymond Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the owner of a successful casino, Burt Donaldson makes a lot of money. It irks him that he has to give most of it to the Internal Revenue Service, so he comes up with a plan. He recruits a partner from overseas to set a complicated scheme in action. Thanks to Burts influence, his foreign partner is about to win at Burts casinoand win &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt;. The part that most people dont know is that this lucky winner has agreed to give 90 percent of his winnings back to Burtsecretly. &lt;br&gt;
Greed isnt his only vice. Burts wedding vows have never kept him loyal to his wife, and he occasionally dines with one of his female lawyers. This doesnt sit well with her boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Burts vice presidents. Sure, the sex is hot, but is it all worth it in the end?&lt;br&gt;
As Burt is about to find out, greed and ambition are unreliable factors in any scheme. Forced to travel abroad to reclaim his windfall when his partner betrays him, he ends up with more than he bargained for. Imprisoned in a foreign jail, fighting for his life on a murder charge, Burt turns to a higher power for salvation of both body and soul.&lt;br&gt;
Burts karma is about to bite him where it counts, and hes not exactly in control anymore. Will he get whats coming to him?" />
