      <meta name="description" content="This gripping episode is the second in the series and the sequel to Legend of the Red Ruby.
Having found the red ruby, Ava is living a much more comfortable life. Yet, she continues to miss her dear mother terribly. Loading up her trusty camel Sandstorm, Ava and her best friend, Mohammad, set off on a brand new quest to find the mysterious scepter.
