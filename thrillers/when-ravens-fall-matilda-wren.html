  <title>When Ravens Fall - Matilda Wren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GOOD v EVIL   FREE WILL v DESTINY
Essex isnt just about the glamour. Away from the ditzy charm, fake tan and false eyelashes, lies a hidden world of drugs, carnage, and violence run by the county&#39;s crime lords.
   Is love fully understood at seventeen? Rachel didnt think so. The fixation and infatuation that two people can have for one another scared her so much she didnt just run away from it; she bolted, straight into a teenage pregnancy and numerous failed relationships in a bid to forget Sean Fergus. 
   She never really understood why she ran, a little voice in her head told her to and she had listened. So why had she spent the last ten years trying to replace him? 
Sean however understood it fully. He knew she had to run because he knew what he was, even if she didnt. 
   He was a monster. There was a dark, vile evil that lived inside him. It made him do wicked things and what made it worse was that the evil force that consumed him, made him enjoy it. Women werent safe with him. 
   When Sean meets Rachel again, unexpectedly he sees a tiny glimmer of hope that redemption is possible. If they could just find their way through the maze of infatuation and fixation, then they just might finally stand a chance of a normal happy relationship. But can a person change? 
   Can good overcome evil? 
   Whilst Sean is forced to confront the violence of his past and take on what he sees as the demons that threaten his future, Rachel finally realises why she ran. She knows she has to run again but this time it is for her life not her heart. But will Sean let her go so easily this time?" />
