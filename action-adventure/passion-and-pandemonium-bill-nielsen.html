  <title>Passion and Pandemonium - Bill Nielsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Colt and Molly, intensely in love, face devastating horror with grace and humor while fighting to contain a truly horrendous invasive species.
Passion and Pandemonium is a very timely novel-sized work that mixes romance and humor with the stark terror of a believable monster story. It is timely because killer snakeheads imported from China have been found in a Maryland pond and the Potomac River. This is not a giant alligator in my basement type of tale.
Ecocidae Gigas Dentire or Giant Toothed Pike were thought to be extinct although Inuit people have tried for years to tell the Kabloona (White Man) about what they call The Qaakil; sixteen-foot monsters found in some remote lakes of the far north. Those stories were dismissed as folklore.
The Stanton family takes a brave and principled stance when they realize they are responsible for importing these monsters into New York State waterways.
Colt and Molly will experience horrifying situations including attempted murder as they work to contain these monsters while at the same time discovering the joys of newfound love." />
