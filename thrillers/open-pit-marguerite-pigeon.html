  <title>Open Pit - Marguerite Pigeon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;El Salvador, 2005: a group of Canadian human-rights activists are taken hostage by a former revolutionary fighter who demands that a new gold mine stops production. For Danielle Byrd, the situation is all too familiar, as she was there twenty years previously as an embedded journalist with a guerrilla faction during the country&#39;s civil war. Now, her daughter Aida must herself travel to the scarred landscape and choose her allies carefully if she wants to see her mother alive once more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With character-driven action and imagery reminiscent of Georges Arnaud&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Wages of Fear&lt;/i&gt; and a complex plot that recalls John Le Carré&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Constant Gardener&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Open Pit&lt;/i&gt; explores the legacy of violent conflict in a complex, shifting present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Open Pit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;There&#39;s no question that Pigeon knows of what she writes, and she cares deeply about human rights and complicated environmental issues... &lt;i&gt;Open Pit&lt;/i&gt; has the saving grace of being about something- the difficulties of indigenous people who must confront the combined power of their own governments in league with Canadian mining companies.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Cherie Thiessen, &lt;i&gt;BC Bookworld&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Open Pit&lt;/i&gt; contains brutality, violence, destruction of trust and seeming collaboration, all painted in many more shades of grey than a typical political novel. When personal goals do not fully match political goals, things get murky, and motivation and dramatic irony muddy the waters further.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ J.C. Sutcliffe, &lt;i&gt;Slightly Bookist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Pigeon&#39;s exemplary novel is truly worthy of a chorus of cheerleading critics and discerning readers.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Wayne Cunningham, &lt;i&gt;subTerrain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
