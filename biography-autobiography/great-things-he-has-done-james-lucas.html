  <title>Great Things He Has Done - James Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have in your hands the first book of the Lucas family legacy. This story is told for one purpose, and that is to declare the great things God has done. Out of gratitude for the faithfulness of our Lord and Savior and for the hope this story can bring courage for its readers to live such a life that they may see God do even mightier manifestations of Gods grace. 
Read how James and Francille gave away their small logging business in Oregon then were called by God to the mission field with their four children and one due in four months. By Gods grace, they went without having any salary but managed to live in a foreign country and learn the culture and language. Furthermore, they were challenged to make disciples and preach among people who were engulfed in a religion that opposed the gospel.
This little book is only the introduction of their ministry. They have been doing this in countries all around the world for the past forty-three years, seeing God do great things." />
