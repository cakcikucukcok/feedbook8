  <title>Hospitable Planet - Stephen A. Jurovics</title>
      <meta name="description" content="•    Environmental professional with a strong grounding in the Old Testament
•    Approaches environmental issues from both scientific and faith perspectives
•    Addresses a growing concern for earth among people of faith
The book seeks to enroll a hitherto under-represented, though large and influential, portion of the U.S. population in addressing climate change: committed American Christians, of all denominations.
Most books about climate change that include a religious argument do not address what individuals can do to help our society transform from fossil fuel use, other than changing personal behavior—and readers suspect that will likely not suffice. Thus, some readers are left feeling disheartened. In contrast, books that primarily address the environmental issues have limited appeal to people motivated more by faith than science, thereby leaving out many who could constitute the tipping point for full American engagement on the issue. Hospitable Planet: Faith, Action, and Climate Change, seeks to fill the gap in religious and secular texts by providing both a compelling biblical case for action on climate change and by identifying transformative ameliorating measures and how to accomplish them. 
The book describes quite clearly what actions to undertake, how to accomplish them, and why this course of action can attain its objectives.  The book lists the major steps needed to slow climate change, drawn primarily from writings of James Hansen and Amory Lovins that, regrettably, do not reach a general audience. In addition, the book recommends an environmental rights movement, akin to the civil rights movement, as a way to implement the recommended actions." />
