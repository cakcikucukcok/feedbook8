  <title>Is My Husband Gay, Straight, or Bi?: A Guide for Women Concerned about Their Men - Joe Kort, Alexander P. Morgan</title>

At a time when the definition of marriage is changing, and relationships in general may be fraught with uncertainty about a variety of basic issues, a book that addresses the concerns of women who suspect their men are gay or have gay tendencies can help make sense of a confusing situation and reveal ways in which couples can understand a man&amp;rsquo;s interest in gay sex and remain married, even happily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
