      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pulitzer winning investigative reporter Brandon Stewart has been uncovering corruption, scandal and greed in the nations capital his entire career. Yet when the widow of former president Preston Hodges commissions Stewart to write her husbands biography, Stewart finds himself investigating the biggest cover-up of his career.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wading through a host of conspiracy theories that claim Hodges was killed in a coup detat, Stewart begins interviewing members of Hodges previous inner circle and is soon led down a trail of clues that leads to MOHICAN, an ultra-secret CIA project that was the center piece of Hodges dramatic world peace agenda, a project that disappeared when Hodges died.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With an FBI bodyguard assigned to protect him, Stewart discovers that hes being shadowed by the CIA as he puts the pieces of the MOHICAN puzzle together. But when someone tries to kill him to suppress what he has learned, Stewart launches a counter-attack, bringing his adversaries to the negotiating table and uncovering one of the largest intelligence scams in history.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Filled with political intrigue, espionage, romance and the wisdom of self discovery, MOHICAN demonstrates the lengths some government officials will go to in protecting their covert interests and the power one man can wield in bringing those officials into the spotlight of justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
