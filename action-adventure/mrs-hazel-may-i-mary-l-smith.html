  <title>Mrs. Hazel, May I? - Mary L. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Hazel, May I? is a portrait of life in a rural area back in post-Great Depression days. &lt;br /&gt;People were dedicated, had good morals, loved, and took care of each other. Yes, times were hard, but good compared to what they are today. The challenges provided Mrs. Hazel and her students a bond of love that is still evident today. &lt;br /&gt;When Mrs. Hazel hears that one of her students has passed away, she goes to the funeral home to visit with the family. She is still a teacher at heart. When she is out about town, talking and reminiscing about years gone by, or when she has unexpected guests drop by to visit, she is in her glory. &lt;br /&gt;The world is a much better place, because of people like Mrs. Hazel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
