  <title>The Early Years - Shannon McAllister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Strackston, as a young boy of the tender age of ten. His father is a scientist and his father&amp;#39;s associates are trying to determine what gives oxen their strength. In the process of determining that, the oxen mutate. Mike&amp;#39;s father is approached by a Bruce Baxter with an offer of a job at a university on the other side of the state. Mike&amp;#39;s father reluctantly accepts and they move across the state. As Mike continues his education, he discovers the people of Little Bluff seem different. Mike meets Crystal and Jennifer and they determine that someone is conducting mind control experiments on the people of Little Bluff. After graduation, Mike returns to Farmer Valley to help capture the mutated oxen. In the process of capturing the mutated oxen, Mike sustains a bite that alters him. Mike and several others finally capture all the mutated oxen and they get returned to normal. Mike goes to trade school and upon graduating, is asked to investigate suspicious activity in Minersville and Summersville. Mike joins up with a bounty hunter and they determine that the two companies are doing the mind control experiments in Little Bluff. They also determine what the companies are doing at the mines in the two towns and that the companies are engaged in illegal activity. In the end, Mike believes it is his destiny to fight terrorism and crime and finds love in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
