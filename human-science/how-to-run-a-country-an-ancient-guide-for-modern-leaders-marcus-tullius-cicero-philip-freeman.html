  <title>How to Run a Country: An Ancient Guide for Modern Leaders - Marcus Tullius Cicero, Philip Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marcus Cicero, Rome&#39;s greatest statesman and orator, was elected to the Roman Republic&#39;s highest office at a time when his beloved country was threatened by power-hungry politicians, dire economic troubles, foreign turmoil, and political parties that refused to work together. Sound familiar? Cicero&#39;s letters, speeches, and other writings are filled with timeless wisdom and practical insight about how to solve these and other problems of leadership and politics. How to Run a Country collects the best of these writings to provide an entertaining, common sense guide for modern leaders and citizens. This brief book, a sequel to &lt;i&gt;How to Win an Election&lt;/i&gt;, gathers Cicero&#39;s most perceptive thoughts on topics such as leadership, corruption, the balance of power, taxes, war, immigration, and the importance of compromise. These writings have influenced great leaders--including America&#39;s Founding Fathers--for two thousand years, and they are just as instructive today as when they were first written.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt; Organized by topic and featuring lively new translations, the book also includes an introduction, headnotes, a glossary, suggestions for further reading, and an appendix containing the original Latin texts. The result is an enlightening introduction to some of the most enduring political wisdom of all time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
