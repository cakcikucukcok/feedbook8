  <title>Happy Down Below - Dr. Oliver Gralla, Peter Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;&quot;Treat yourself and your man-root to a thorough and often uproarious read-through. Your health prospects will be pointing at the ceiling in no time.&quot;&amp;#8212;Peter Moore, former editor of &lt;em&gt;Men&#39;s Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;Men are notoriously reluctant to see a doctor. Only three in five men report going for an annual physical, and over 40 percent only ever visit the clinic when their symptoms become unbearable. Many know little or nothing about their bodies, with dire consequences for their well-being.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Happy Down Below&lt;/em&gt;, men’s health specialist Dr. Oliver Gralla provides a clever and highly entertaining remedy to that situation. Packed with colorful anecdotes and quirky illustrations, this cheeky guidebook offers practical tips and clear, accessible explanations for helping men (and women) better understand the male body, learn to care for it, and become more comfortable speaking about it with their doctors when things go wrong. With plenty of relatable metaphors and a light, conversational tone, Dr. Gralla provides simple, research-based answers to questions such as: Do male enhancement pills actually work? Why does erectile dysfunction happen and how is it treated? What is a “normal” penis—and how big is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;? And much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
