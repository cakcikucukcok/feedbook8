  <title>Until Death Does Its Part - Pastor Pamula W. Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God gave and certainly He has all authority to take away; never needing to give any warning neither does He have to give any explanation to any one or give reason for His decisions. God is the creator of everything, and certainly life and death is in his hands. None of us know when it starts and neither does anyone know when it shall end, so we live each day like it will never end and embrace the next moment as its as last. Each day we awaken, we are granted time and space for this is all we have been given to be sure of and no one knows what else there is that we shall face before our days come to a close. 
So we live our lives in the process of time while each moment is filling with uncertainties in life. One thing comes, another leaves; something rises up and another falls; while one moves forward, another stands still; one cries and another is fill with laughter; some embrace love, but still there are those that hold on to hate; many become rich, and his brother remains poor; one seeks for his destiny, but the other man chooses not to care what it may hold; one studies to be educated, yet the other leaves it to those that feel it matters, for to him, it has no meaning. While war is in our midst, a baby is being born; some tables are set while another seek the crumbs from the trash of others; one is covered, but some still remain naked; some have much to share, still their greed holds shut their hands and another goes without; many lay in their beds while others seek shelter on the streetsfor this we share in our life and this it is for everyone, for there is nothing else for us to do. Without hope in God, many are bound to lose, so I pray its Him that you will chose, for nothing else really matters and all will come to an end, yet we must keep living  . . .
