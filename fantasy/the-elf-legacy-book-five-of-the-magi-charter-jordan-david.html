  <title>The Elf Legacy - Book Five of The Magi Charter - Jordan David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time marches on... Santas and Elves come and go at the North Pole complex. For some the reasons they choose to leave are personal, for others it&amp;#39;s a dismissal. Santa&amp;#39;s annual Mission must never fail despite how each passing year adds complexity amidst a world plagued by endless wars and upheavals. The denizens of the North are not secluded from the human world&amp;#39;s problems. The complex is not the utopia that some want it to be. Santa and Elves must come to terms with the turbulence of history and not allow personal issues to disrupt their commitments. Anna, Tetsu, and Hilda will each face challenges that threaten their legacies and centuries old friendships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the series: The Magi Charter&lt;br&gt;For over two thousand years the legend of Santa Claus has endured. His is a mission of peace as outlined in the Magi Charter, given to the first Santa by the Child. From humble beginnings following that First Christmas the Santa lineage has been passed down through the ages. This epic adventure tells the story of those Santas from the founding of the North Pole and the origin of the ancient elves, to our modern times where the world&amp;#39;s problems effect even those in the secluded complex of the North, and concluding in the distant future which finds Santa and the elves committed to their mission on a galactic scale where Christmas traditions are barely recognizable. Even in that era those committed to the Charter must find a way to deliver that which is needed most to those most deserving." />
