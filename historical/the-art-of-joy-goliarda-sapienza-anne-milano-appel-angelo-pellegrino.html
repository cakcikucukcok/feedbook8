  <title>The Art of Joy - Goliarda Sapienza, Anne Milano Appel, Angelo Pellegrino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The tumultuous twentieth century, told through the life of a single extraordinary woman&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejected by a series of publishers, abandoned in a chest for twenty years, Goliarda Sapienza&#39;s masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Joy&lt;/i&gt;, survived a turbulent path to publication. It wasn&#39;t until 2005, when it was released in France, that this novel received the recognition it deserves. At last, Sapienza&#39;s remarkable book is available in English, in a brilliant translation by Anne Milano Appel and with an illuminating introduction by Angelo Pellegrino. &lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Art of Joy &lt;/i&gt;centers on Modesta, a Sicilian woman born on January 1, 1900, whose strength and character are an affront to conventional morality. Impoverished as a child, Modesta believes she is destined for a better life. She is able, through grace and intelligence, to secure marriage to an aristocrat--without compromising her own deeply felt values. Friend, mother, lover--Modesta revels in upsetting the rules of her fascist, patriarchal society. &lt;br&gt;     This is the history of the twentieth century, transfigured by the perspective of one extraordinary woman. Sapienza, an intriguing figure in her own right--her father homeschooled her so she wouldn&#39;t be exposed to fascist influences--was a respected actress and writer who drew on her own struggles to craft this powerful epic. A fictionalized memoir, a book of romance and adventure, a feminist text, a bildungsroman--this novel is ultimately undefinable but deeply necessary; its genius will leave readers breathless.&lt;/p&gt;" />
