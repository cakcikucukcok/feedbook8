  <title>Rambles Ii - Jerry Criteser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jerry Criteser says that the classics never get old. They continue to amuse us and continue to warn us.
He has retired, so he has been able to devote his time to writing. His Medea brings us to remember those characters once more. Between the Lines goes behind the curtain and tells what is really going on.
There are a couple of affairs going on in the book also. Eleventh-century England makes an appearance. The author would love to go to Mars, and this appears also. He is a gardener who also likes to travel. There is a short poem about a trip to Singapore, and the poem was written there. 
As he says, read the classics, and use good grammar because that is how people remember you. The writer says that his heroes remain Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and Harper Lee. He hopes you enjoy his book." />
