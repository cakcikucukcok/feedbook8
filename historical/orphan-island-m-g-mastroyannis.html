  <title>Orphan Island - M. G. Mastroyannis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Orphan Island is a historical novel about the island of Cyprus.  Revolution, foreign intrigue, intervention, and intercommunal strife are the elements that make up the islands tragedy.  Squeezed in the vise of East-West power politics during the cold war, Cyprus becomes the apple of discord as against the will of its people NATO tries to pull the non-aligned island into its camp and make it an unsinkable nuclear base.  Through diabolical schemes and stratagems from governments of powerful nations, the island suffers a brutal invasion by the Turks, complete with ferocious atrocities, all in full view of a freedom-loving NATO.
Amid deep hostility, turmoil, espionage, treachery, and war, the love of Achilles and Daphne is rekindled and flourished.  Achilles, an idealist intellectual and zealous fighter for freedom, is one of the leaders in the revolution to kick the British out of Cyprus.  Artistic Daphne is sensitive and emotional, and she lives to love Achilles and to dream an eternal life with him.  But their love follows the intricate weave of their destiny, which is interlaced with the destiny of Cyprus as it is ordained by foreign governments and men with depraved causes.
Orphan Island is based on the true story of Cyprus and its courageous people, who ask to be free and because of that their lives change forever, the result of outworn British colonial mentality, and corrupt American foreign policy and failure." />
