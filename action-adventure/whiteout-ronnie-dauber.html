  <title>Whiteout - Ronnie Dauber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is winter break during her first year of college, and Sarah Davies is excited to leave for her cross country ski trip in North Dakota, traveling by bus with her cousin, Meagan, and friends, Brad and Ali. She boards the bus, quickly falls asleepand then has a horrifying nightmare that she is buried alive. As she awakens with a start, Sarah is relieved to be back in reality, but worries that the dream is a premonition of events to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah is going to North Dakota with the others to attend a celebration with Brads cousin, Holly. Before the special night, the teens set out for a morning of cross-country skiing. With sunny skies and a clear forecast, they believe they have nothing to fear. The weather suddenly changes, however, and Hollys father never arrives to pick them up. After receiving his distress call, the teens struggle through a violent snowstorm to find him, where they soon discover that Hollys father is in more danger than they imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a day of fun transforms into a fast-paced race against time, the teens are forced to embark on a dangerous quest where they all must fight for their survival. &lt;/p&gt;" />
