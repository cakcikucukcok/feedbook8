  <title>Comic Connections - Sandra Eckard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the popularity of comic adaptations on television and at the movies, these current topics can be a great way to engage students by bringing characters and stories they connect with into the classroom to help them build the skills that they need to be successful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Comic Connections: Reflecting on Women in Popular Culture &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is designed to help teachers from middle school through college find exciting new strategies that they can use right away as part of their curricular goals. Each chapter has three pieces: comic relevance, classroom connections, and concluding thoughts; this format allows a reader to pick-and-choose where to start. Some readers might want to delve into the history of a comic to better understand characters and their usefulness, while other readers might want to pick up an activity, presentation, or project that they can fold into that day&amp;rsquo;s lesson. This volume in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Comic Connections &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;series focuses on female characters&amp;mdash;Wonder Woman, Peggy Carter, and Lois Lane, to name a few&amp;mdash;with each chapter deconstructing a specific character to help students engage in meaningful conversations, writing projects, and other activities that will complement and enhance their literacy skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
