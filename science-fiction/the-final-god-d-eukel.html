  <title>The Final God - D. Eukel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When magazine journalist, Jonathan Tame arrives on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico; after an alleged, devastating hurricane has struck the Island; it doesnt take long for the nearly burned-out writer to re-awaken his investigative training. There is a ton of money being poured into emergency coffers, but only a small portion has been allocated for repairs. Following the money trail, he discovers that a powerful entity is attempting to control the U.S. government, and other world leaders. The cash flow seems to be related to some secret project that is intended to disarm all of them. And further; that ancient archaeological artifacts, discovered years before, and said to have immeasurable power, may be the core reason behind the whole thing. In his pursuit of the truth, he finds that he is not alone; other investigators are moving in the same direction -- it&#39;s when their paths intersect that all of hell is stirred up." />
