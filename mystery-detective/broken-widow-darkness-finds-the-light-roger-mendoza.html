  <title>Broken Widow: Darkness Finds the Light - Roger Mendoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elizabeth scrubbed away at the blood that had pooled on her floor. There was a lot of blood. She thought about the man that had just been lying here as she scrubbed harder. He was one of the men that worked for her husband more than ten years ago. She remembered him as soon as she saw him.&amp;nbsp; She believed that he was the man that had killed her dear friend, Margaret. She wiped a tear away from her cheek. She never expected to see him again. Just an hour before he was in her living room pointing a gun at her and Tom, her son. She threw the once pristine white rag into the pail full of blood red water and went to get some fresh water...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Elizabeth, now 49 years old lost her husband, Josef ten years before. He was the most powerful man in the small town not far from San Francisco.&amp;nbsp; After he died, her brother, Thomas took over the Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s job. She hoped that Thomas would be a just and fair sheriff. She&amp;rsquo;d been wrong. She and her son moved to San Francisco to get away from the corruption that permeated that town. Just a few months ago, Thomas was shot dead after he&amp;rsquo;d used his influence to have an innocent man found guilty of murder.&amp;nbsp; Now Elizabeth lives alone in San Francisco and her son, Tom is the sheriff of the small town that she left all those years ago. She&amp;rsquo;s very proud of Tom, he is a fair and just sheriff. She is haunted by memories of her dead husband and of her dear friend Margaret. But, some loose ends from her past threaten to bring chaos back into her life. Someone is going to kill her unless she makes peace with the past and starts living in the present.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the third book in the series:&amp;nbsp; The E. B. Roberts Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
