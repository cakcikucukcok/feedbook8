          &lt;strong&gt;Emma Daniels wanted a wild sexfest–and she got it. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After being cheated on by her very boring accountant boyfriend, executive secretary Emma decided to go on vacation and get crazy with the most exciting man she could find. Along came Andres, the Latin lover she met on a singles cruise. And after doing everything possible in bed with Andres, she returned home with a big smile on her face….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Which quickly disappeared when she ran into sexy, thrilling &quot;Andres&quot; at the office working as the new systems analyst, of all things. His name wasn&#39;t even Andres–it was Tony! Apparently he&#39;d been playing a little game himself while away. And when confronted, what did he have the nerve to say? &quot;There are a few more things I think we should try….&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
