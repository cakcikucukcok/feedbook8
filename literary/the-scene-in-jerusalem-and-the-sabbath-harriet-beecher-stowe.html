  <title>The Scene in Jerusalem and The Sabbath - Harriet Beecher Stowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The Scene in Jerusalem and The Sabbath are two short stories written by Harriet Beecher Stowe. She is known as the writer of the bestseller Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alone, or almost alone, the few remaining priests move like white-winged, solitary birds over the gorgeous pavements of the temple, and as they mechanically conduct the ministrations of the day, cast significant glances on each other, and pause here and there to converse in anxious whispers. Ah there is one voice which they have often heard beneath those arches - a voice which ever bore in it a mysterious and thrilling charm--which they know will be hushed today. Chief priest, scribe, and doctor have all gone out in the death procession after him; and these few remaining ones, far from the excitement of the crowd, and busied in calm and sacred duties, find voices of anxious questioning rising from the depths of their own souls, &quot;What if this indeed were the Christ?&quot; &quot;&quot; &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
