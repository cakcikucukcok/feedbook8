  <title>It&#39;s About Time - Alex Duthie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its About Time&lt;/i&gt; presents an introduction to theoretical physics as well as challenges to some of the concepts put forward by theoretical physicists of our time. These scientists have presented such concepts in countless public lectures, highlights of which are compiled here along with a variety of historical data, such as the history of earth time. Also included are short biographies of physicists who have contributed significantly to our knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help foster understanding of the related astronomical matters, &lt;i&gt;Its About Time&lt;/i&gt; includes technical information relating to Newton and Keplers laws. Technical discussions are appended to the end of each relevant chapter. Furthermore, it offers a credible and significant challenge to Einsteins theories and to the current thinking on time dilation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study outlines some procedural guidelines for young physicists and suggests how academic institutions can become custodians of a central depository of reference data, facilitating future physicists into more efficient and fruitful endeavors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study offers no challenge to mathematics, which is a pure and exact science. When a physicist is able to have the mathematics represent natural phenomena, then mathematics becomes a necessary tool for our simplified understanding of nature. Eventually all of nature will be reduced to mathematical terms. The challenge presented here is to theoretical mathematics with no proven relationship to natural phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;" />
