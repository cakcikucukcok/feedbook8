  <title>Ashley&#39;s Special Gift - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trish and Brad have decided to do something special for their sweet little boarder, Ashley. As a Christmas present, they have given her a ticket to go see her parents in Florida for her winter vacation. Ashley is thrilled, and vows she is going to come up with something very special to give them for Christmas, as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All Trish wants for Christmas is for her and Brad to invite another woman into their bed the way they used to. For years they would share attractive young girls, but after a close call with a student, they&amp;#39;ve decided they can&amp;#39;t risk it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Trish misses the fun, and they end up in argument about it. In the end, Trish is resigned to the fact it will never happen again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trish, however, is in for a big surprise. After overhearing their argument, Ashley has decided she knows what her special gift to her favorite couple is going to be; she is going to give herself to them to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After all, &amp;rsquo;tis the season of giving!" />
