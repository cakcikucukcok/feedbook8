  <title>Look and See - Chipo Mudere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Look and see is a book which provokes the eagle in you, to challenge you to enjoy the eagle`s view from above, for thats where you belong. Like Abraham the author is saying get out of your tent, look to the north, the south, the east and the west- What do you see? 
True vision always ignores the process but worries about the destination. God never speaks to you about the Red sea, the bitter waters of Marah, or the thirty eight years of wondering, he just talks of the milk and honey. 
This keeps your eyes and appetite focused on the destination. The Devil never talks to you about the destination; he only amplifies how insurmountable the process is. 
We were born and designed by God to be successful in what he destined us for. Absence of vision makes us look like an experiment or a biological accident in life. The great Physicist, Mr. Albert Einstein said, 
&quot;Everyone is a genius, but if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid&quot;. 
What really makes the difference in a person`s life? One would think the answer is very obvious, but if it was so, all people would be successful. In Proverbs 29:13 we read these amazing words: 
The poor man and the rich man have this in common; the Lord gives sight to the eyes of both. 
This kind of comparison is given twice in the book of Proverbs, first in Proverbs 22:2: &quot;Rich and poor have this in common; the Lord is the maker of them all." />
