  <title>Small Blessings - Martha Woodroof</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From debut novelist Martha Woodroof comes an inspiring tale of a small-town college professor, a remarkable new woman at the bookshop, and the ten-year old son he never knew he had.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Putnam has resigned himself to a quiet and half-fulfilled life. An English professor in a sleepy college town, he spends his days browsing the Shakespeare shelves at the campus bookstore, managing the oddball faculty in his department and caring, alongside his formidable mother-in-law, for his wife Marjory, a fragile shut-in with unrelenting neuroses, a condition exacerbated by her discovery of Tom&#39;s brief and misguided affair with a visiting poetess a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, one evening at the bookstore, Tom and Marjory meet Rose Callahan, the shop&#39;s charming new hire, and Marjory invites Rose to their home for dinner, out of the blue, her first social interaction since her breakdown. Tom wonders if it&#39;s a sign that change is on the horizon, a feeling confirmed upon his return home, where he opens a letter from his former paramour, informing him he&#39;d fathered a son who is heading Tom&#39;s way on a train.  His mind races at the possibility of having a family after so many years of loneliness. And it becomes clear change is coming whether Tom&#39;s ready or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heartwarming story with a charmingly imperfect cast of characters to cheer for, &lt;i&gt;Small Blessings&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s wonderfully optimistic heart that reminds us that sometimes, when it feels like life has veered irrevocably off track, the track shifts in ways we never can have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
