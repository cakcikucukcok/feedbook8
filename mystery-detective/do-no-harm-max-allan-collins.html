  <title>Do No Harm - Max Allan Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do No Harm&lt;/i&gt; is the latest mystery in the Nathan Heller series by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Max Allan Collins.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1954 and Heller takes on the Sam Sheppard case--a young doctor is startled from sleep and discovers his wife brutally murdered. He claims that a mysterious intruder killed his wife. But all the evidence points to a disturbed husband who has grown tired of married life and yearned to be free at all costs. Sheppard is swiftly convicted and sent to rot in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how firm was the evidence...and was it tampered with to fit a convenient narrative to settle scores and push political agendas? Nathan&#39;s old friend Elliot Ness calls in a favor and as Nathan digs into the case he becomes convinced of Sheppard&#39;s innocence. But Nate can&#39;t prove it and has to let the case drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road to justice is sometimes a long one. Heller&#39;s given another chance years later and this time he&#39;s determined to free the man...even if it brings his own death a bit closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
