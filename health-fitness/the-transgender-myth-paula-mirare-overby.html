  <title>The Transgender Myth - Paula Mirare Overby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In my childhood I believed I was a girl. I hated the short hair and the hand me down cloths from my brother but otherwise I felt certain I was the same as my girl friends. When I finally accepted the social belief that I was a boy I struggled to conceal my own truth. But that truth was inescapable. The idea that your sex, gender and abilities are the same was a total myth, the transgender myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, after 28 years of marriage, I lost my 15-year-old son under allegations a transgender woman was unfit to be a mother.&amp;nbsp;Wrongly&amp;nbsp;accused of abusing my son, I&amp;nbsp;became the defendant in a legal drama dedicated to protecting&amp;nbsp;the birth&amp;nbsp;mother and child, dispossessed of any notion that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was the mom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every&amp;nbsp;court&amp;nbsp;appearance came with new threats:&amp;nbsp;felony charges, loss of parenting time, more legal fees, contempt of court, even jail time. Therapists I had once&amp;nbsp;looked to&amp;nbsp;for help made accusations against me.&amp;nbsp;The consensus was overwhelming; no judge would ever grant me custody.&amp;nbsp;But I was unwilling to abandon my son. I dismissed two attorneys unwilling to defend my&amp;nbsp;position, finally representing myself in a custody battle lasting four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation and the economic and emotional stress, combined with&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;threats from the court, drove me into a near-suicidal depression but the love of my son prevailed. I regained custody while becoming the woman I had always known I was.&lt;/p&gt;" />
