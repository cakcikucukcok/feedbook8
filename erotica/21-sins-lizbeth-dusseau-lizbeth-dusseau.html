  <title>21 Sins -  Lizbeth Dusseau, Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Girls in her position give up their names and their lives... they&#39;re sold as lots. This story is about Lot 21...The former Melinda duBois is brought to the State Detention Center upon the death of her &#39;guardian&#39; her owner, lover and sexual master, Samuel Janes. Will she be reassigned - sold to another guardian in a lifetime contract of indentured servitude? Or will her counselor, Sydney Wingate, choose to release her to a mainstream life that she knows nothing about&#39;Service contracts&#39; to guardian overseers were once meant to alleviate a problem with prison overcrowding, but have become a way to coerce young females into contractual service arrangements - another kind of prostitution. Sydney despises the devious twist that makes the sexual slavery of women virtually institutionalized by law. And yet, as she interviews her client, Lot 21, in the dank burrows of the ominous Transfer Sector, she becomes intrigued, even aroused, by the curious naked girl who has been ordered to seek her counsel. The girl&#39;s wild and stunning tales of sexual debauchery and sadomasochistic sex lure Sydney into this despised world, and to the Underground Market for research purposes. And when her boyfriend takes her to this &#39;meat market&#39; a strange transformation occurs. While they play-act the roles of Master and slave, Sydney discovers the reason why this life might be appealing and the best place for a young innocent like Melinda duBois. The deeper Sydney delves into this exhilarating darkness, the more she fears that her mission of mercy to save the dutiful Lot 21 will only delay the inevitable transfer of her ownership to the charming, wily sadist who intends to buy her" />
