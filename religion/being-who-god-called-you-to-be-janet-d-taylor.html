In life,there are so many things that we face,and so many things that we deal with.Some which are not always easy.As we begin tojourney through these things,we can become so consumed by them,that we forget exactlywho we&#39;re supposed to be,based on the situations that we&#39;re in! Weare designed byGodand made in His image, so therefore,we&#39;re called by Him! &lt;U&gt;BEING WHO GOD CALLED YOU TO BE,&lt;/U&gt; is simply saying Iwill do your willfor my life God! I&#39;mtired of hidingwho Iam for others, I&#39;mtired of holding backwhat should be mine forothers,and Iwant what&#39;srightfully mine from youAlmighty God! The masks have hindered whoIshould be,the walls have blocked where I&#39;m supposed to be,and I&#39;veheld up whoI&#39;mcalled to be!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; You&#39;re a part of God&#39;s original design!He knew you from thebeginning, in the midst of it all,and He knows where youwill end! He designed the way, and Hewill guide your way through!AskGodfor direction andfollow His lead!&lt;STRONG&gt;THE&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;CHOICE IS YOURS!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Will you be led by God? Will you take off the masksand break down the walls? Can you be who God called you to be?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Iknow that you can do all of these things,but my question is, &quot;DO YOU KNOW?&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
