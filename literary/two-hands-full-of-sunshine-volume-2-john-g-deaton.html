  <title>Two Hands Full of Sunshine (Volume 2) - John G. Deaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You are our warrior,&quot; Debbie said to him.  &quot;You and Sari.  Do not easily let them take the Children of Israel, the future of our country.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It was absurd and impromptu, this word.  Just there the flames, the enemy, and death.  Yet words can surprise, can be more then words and this one seared through them like a bright hot poker and Debbie rushed back and added her hands to theirs, both her hands to all of theirs, and in the warmth of it they were instantly one:  a single heart, a single brain, a single breast, one being, one purpose, one common goal.  Jacob&#39;s hands went on top, and from his lips came the torch itself, for in hiding places and ghettos and death camps, in this black Passover week of 1942, in Hitler&#39;s death trap known as Poland, invincible forces were set in motion.  This word, this concept, this &lt;I&gt;Israel&lt;/I&gt; was riveted into an alloy stronger than any steel, an alloy to forge a great nation, a nation that their every action helped to build. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;To Zion!&quot; Jacob shouted, and their hosannas clamored into the night.  --From &lt;I&gt;Two Hands Full of Sunshine&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
