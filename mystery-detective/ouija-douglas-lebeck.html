      <meta name="description" content="A sadistic murder takes place in a high-rise overlooking the Detroit River. A suspicious suicide happens in the suburbs. There is no evidence in either case that tells the authorities what really happened. Another murder, another possible suicide, and the bodies begin to pile up.
     Dino Fratelli is at it again--on the track of another serial killer. But this one is unlike anyone ... anything ... that he&#39;s gone after before. This one is able to do things that no human being should be able to do. This one cannot be stopped.
     There is just one clue--a board game and a teenage beer blast that went wrong nearly fifty years ago--and a young man sent to prison for manslaughter. Kyle Everett spent tens years locked up, and for the past forty years has lived in the abandoned buildings of the inner city. Is he the perpetrator, or is he only the key to solving the mystery?" />
