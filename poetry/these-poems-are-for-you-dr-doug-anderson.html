  <title>These Poems Are for You - Dr. Doug Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sensitive/Stimulating/Satisfying! We tend to forget about the wonderful sequence of events of the past that have caused us to become all that we are today. Way back then some seemed burdonsome, cumbersome, and unquestionably quite irritating. However, we endured these experiences and grew. Other happenings were joyous occasions and these were also used as tools destined to leave an indelible, lasting, effervescent impression. Doug Anderson has a God given ability to reach back into the past and recall subtle, and somewhat hidden, manifestations of unseen protective care that accompanies each of us along life&#39;s pilgrim earthly journey. Make it a point to search for deeper truths contained in each poem. Then ask yourself if the lessons learned were equal to or greater than the time you spent reading the book. The greatest commodity possessed by humanity is the supreme gift of time. We must learn to use it wisely lest it vanish before us in almost the twinkling of an eye." />
