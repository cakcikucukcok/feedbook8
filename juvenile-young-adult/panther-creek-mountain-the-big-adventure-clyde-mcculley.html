  <title>Panther Creek Mountain-The Big Adventure - Clyde McCulley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Clay and Luke are brothers who live in the Appalachian Mountains during the 1950s. They live with their folks in log cabins on Panther Creek Mountain, high above the Wild Cat River. Their cousin, Sally Jane, lives with her Mama, Aunt Olive, in the same mountain settlement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their little community has no electricity and no running water. The kids do not have much money, but they are rich with adventures. Around any corner they might come face to face with rattlesnakes, wild razorbacks, and panthers. Fueled by colorful imagination, their travels lead them to a thieves&amp;rsquo; cave, an Indian burial ground, a deadly booby trap, and a crazy woman hiding in their &amp;ldquo;clubhouse.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clay, 11, is leader of the pack. Luke and Sally Jane are both 9. The boys are &amp;ldquo;real boys&amp;rdquo; and Sally Jane is no sissy. She is spunky, smart, cute and full of energy. They share the same quest for adventure and excitement as well as a strong and protective love for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join the three kids in their crazy adventures as they dream up ways to make money, build and discover secret hideaways, and explore rivers and ponds. Along with the kids, you&amp;rsquo;ll meet a country peddler, as well as Ol&amp;rsquo; Larry&amp;mdash;a genuine old mountain man&amp;mdash;and other colorful characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: After a busy day of adventures, Clay, Luke and Sally Jane will all fall asleep while listening for the panther to scream in the distant hills.&lt;/p&gt;" />
