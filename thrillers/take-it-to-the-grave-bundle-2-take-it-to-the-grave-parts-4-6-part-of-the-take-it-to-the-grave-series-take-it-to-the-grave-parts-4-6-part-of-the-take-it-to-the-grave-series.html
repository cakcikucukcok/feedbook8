          &lt;strong&gt;Take It to the Grave Bundle 2 containing Parts 4-6&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maisey thought her nephew&#39;s christening party would be the perfect chance to reconnect with her sister, Sarah Taylor-Cox. But Maisey has spent years running from the past, and seeing her estranged family is stirring up long-suppressed memories, memories that are slowly tormenting her and forcing her to question everything she thought she knew.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not only that, Sarah seems a far cry from the calm, controlled sister who always used to protect her. What is really going on behind the closed doors of the Taylor-Coxes&#39; Hamptons mansion?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah Taylor-Cox knows her glamorous life is about to come crashing down around her. Someone knows her secrets, and seems determined to tell. With every waking moment, her paranoia increases. And when the day of her beloved baby&#39;s christening arrives, she can&#39;t help but look at everyone through a haze of suspicion. Who hates her so much they are willing to destroy her?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maisey is becoming ever more worried about her sister, Sarah. They may have grown apart, but they still love each other. Then the sisters&#39; bond is tested further than ever before when Sarah shows Maisey a note she&#39;s received: When the wind blows the cradle will rock.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Part 6&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Sarah Taylor-Cox wakes up to find her beloved baby not in his cot, her whole body starts to shake. Someone has been sending her threatening notes, and now her precious boy is in danger. Who has taken him, what do they want and how far will they go to destroy Sarah&#39;s life?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Time has run out. She must confront the past once and for all. The only question is, will she and her baby survive, or are the consequences of the dark secrets around her too deadly to contain?&lt;/p&gt;
