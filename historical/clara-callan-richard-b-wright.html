  <title>Clara Callan - Richard B. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a small town in Canada, Clara Callan reluctantly takes leave of her sister, Nora, who is bound for New York. It&#39;s a time when the growing threat of fascism in Europe is a constant worry, and people escape from reality through radio and the movies. Meanwhile, the two sisters -- vastly different in personality, yet inextricably linked by a shared past -- try to find their places within the complex web of social expectations for young women in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Nora embarks on a glamorous career as a radio-soap opera star, Clara, a strong and independent-minded woman, struggles to observe the traditional boundaries of a small and tight-knit community without relinquishing her dreams of love, freedom, and adventure. However, things aren&#39;t as simple as they appear -- Nora&#39;s letters eventually reveal life in the big city is less exotic than it seems, and the tranquil solitude of Clara&#39;s life is shattered by a series of unforeseeable events. These twists of fate require all of Clara&#39;s courage and strength, and finally put the seemingly unbreakable bond between the sisters to the test.&lt;/p&gt;" />
