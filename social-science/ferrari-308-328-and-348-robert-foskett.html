      <meta name="description" content="Ferrari 308, 328 and 348 traces the complete story of the four models of Ferrari&#39;s V8-powered sports cars between 1973 and 1995 - the cars that broke Ferrari out of the V6 and V12 moulds, with the V8 becoming Ferrari&#39;s most popular engine choice in the final decade of the twentieth century. The book covers the history and development of Ferrari&#39;s new V8 engine, and the 308&#39;s daunting role as successor to the popular Dino. There are specification tables and production figures for the model variants, along with details of concept cars and other related models, and a review of competition exploits. The book also considers the cars&#39; current position in the classic car market and offers insight into the rewarding ownership experience each of the models now represents.The book covers: design processes and styling by Bertone and Pininfarina; concept cars and rivals; the cars in competition; owning and running the cars today. With a guide through the entire lifespan of these exciting V8-powered sports cars and superbly illustrated with 295 colour photographs, this is essential reading for the Ferrari aficionado." />
