  <title>The Poetry of Derek Walcott 1948-2013 - Derek Walcott, Glyn Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A collection spanning the whole of Derek Walcott&#39;s celebrated, inimitable, essential career &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;He gives us more than himself or &#39;a world&#39;; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language.&quot; Alongside Joseph Brodsky&#39;s words of praise one might mention the more concrete honors that the renowned poet Derek Walcott has received: a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship; the Queen&#39;s Gold Medal for Poetry; the Nobel Prize in Literature.&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Poetry of Derek Walcott 1948&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;2013&lt;/i&gt; draws from every stage of the poet&#39;s storied career. Here are examples of his very earliest work, like &quot;In My Eighteenth Year,&quot; published when the poet himself was still a teenager; his first widely celebrated verse, like &quot;A Far Cry from Africa,&quot; which speaks of violence, of loyalties divided in one&#39;s very blood; his mature work, like &quot;The Schooner Flight&quot; from &lt;i&gt;The Star-Apple Kingdom&lt;/i&gt;; and his late masterpieces, like the tender &quot;Sixty Years After,&quot; from the 2010 collection &lt;i&gt;White Egrets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;     &lt;/i&gt;Across sixty-five years, Walcott grapples with the themes that have defined his work as they have defined his life: the unsolvable riddle of identity; the painful legacy of colonialism on his native Caribbean island of St. Lucia; the mysteries of faith and love and the natural world; the Western canon, celebrated and problematic; the trauma of growing old, of losing friends, family, one&#39;s own memory. This collection, selected by Walcott&#39;s friend the English poet Glyn Maxwell, will prove as enduring as the questions, the passions, that have driven Walcott to write for more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
