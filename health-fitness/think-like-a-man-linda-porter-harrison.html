  <title>Think Like a Man - Linda Porter Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Think Like a Manand heres a thought: Start Acting Like a Man
The 25 mistakes men make that prevent them from finding and keeping true love
This is the perfect companion book to Steve Harveys book Act Like a Lady.
There are hundreds of books written for women on how to find a man. Yet, very few books that address the critical things that men do or dont do that prevent relationships from thriving and going to the next level.  One of my personal goals is to promote marriage, and to help people stay in love. When Steve Harvey wrote the book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, millions of women flocked to purchase a book that was going to show them how to get a man. To be perfectly honest with you, I didnt realize the magnitude of how naive we were as women when it came to men. However, I was equally disturbed by the fact that no one was addressing what men needed to do to rectify this relationship thing. Relationships dont simply fail because of women; men play a vital role too. I could have easily written one hundred mistakes that men make, but I chose to focus on the twenty-five mistakes that I hear repeatedly from married and single women. It is my hope, that this book will cultivate a more balanced conversation between men and women. More importantly, that this book will shed some light for men on their own relationships and that they will begin to take the necessary steps to foster and create the ultimate love." />
