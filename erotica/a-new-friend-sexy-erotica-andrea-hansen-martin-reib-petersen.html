  <title>A New Friend - Sexy erotica - Andrea Hansen, Martin Reib Petersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I just moved to Barcelona, and I don&#39;t know anyone other than my co-workers at my new job. They&#39;re the ones who told me about the public pool. In one of the pools, a man is doing a front crawl. I dive into the water and open my eyes. The man is toned and muscular. His buttocks clench as his legs kick in the water. I stick my head above the surface again, and grab the edge of the pool with one hand. When the man is heading away from me, I let my hand slide down between my legs. During his first lap, I rub outside the fabric. The second time he turns away from me, I let my hand slide underneath the fabric. My body feels warm. My movements pick up pace. My cheeks flush, and just as I&#39;m about to loose myself in the activity, he suddenly stops. He&#39;s looking straight at me from the other end of the pool. My hand freezes between my legs. Did he notice what I&#39;ve been doing?&quot;
This short story is published in collaboration with the Swedish filmproducer Erika Lust. Her intention is to depict human nature and diversity through stories of passion, intimacy, lust and love in a fusion of powerful stories and erotica." />
