  <title>Mastering The Maid - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lord Albert Rook is a hedonist and rake, delighting in the darker side of human nature. Where he sees innocence, he longs to corrupt it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Isabel is the embodiment of innocence, or so it seems. A young maid in Lord Rook&amp;#39;s service, she is submissive and shy. Perfect for what his Lordship intends&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of one sinful night, Lord Rook teaches Isabel to embrace the dark delights of debauchery, and to surrender her body and soul to her new master.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Good evening my dear.&amp;quot; He gave a low bow. &amp;quot;I trust you are well. Perhaps you would like a glass of wine?&amp;quot; He indicated towards the open bottle on the side-table. &amp;quot;I drink only the best.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Yes sir, I would love some wine. Thank you&amp;quot; she said politely and met his eyes for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He filled a glass and handed it to her. It looked oversize in her petite hands. She really was a delicate little thing. He wondered whether she would be able to take what he had in store for her, or whether he would break her.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He poured a glass and took a sip. It tasted good, but then his senses were always heightened before he indulged in sexual depravity.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So, Isabel. I will repeat what I said to you earlier. I am your master, and you a mere servant to my whims and desires. Whatever I ask of you, you will obey. Do you understand?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Isabel&amp;#39;s hands trembled as she held the wine glass. She took a small sip of the wine and delighted in its taste. It was fruity and fragrant and she smiled. &amp;quot;Yes. I understand sir.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Good. Because at times tonight, you may be frightened. Terrified even. But cruel though I undoubtedly am, I am not a monster. Your life belongs to me, but I will not end it. Indeed, perhaps you will find something wakened within you that you did not know existed. But if not, I will give you a safe-word to use. If you utter this word, I will let you leave at once. The word is &amp;#39;Lucifer.&amp;#39; Do you understand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He gestured to her wine glass. &amp;quot;Finish it. You may find some courage in it.&amp;quot;" />
