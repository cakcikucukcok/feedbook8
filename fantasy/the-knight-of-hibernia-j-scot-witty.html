  <title>The Knight of Hibernia - J. Scot Witty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arriving on a distant shore, guided only by a mysterious book he found of a dead man, Dar LaCross journeys to join the famed Knights of Hibernia. But he soon finds that things are not how he expects as he clings to a knightly code of honor obsolete in the world he encounters. A young woman, Fayette, on a mission for the Duchess of the Eamhain, finds herself in midst of an invasion. 
Fayette convinces Dar to help her cross the wilds of the Marche to reach Eamhain before it is too late. Hunted by the invaders, Dar and Fayette must use their wit and skill to cross the wilderness of an untamed world. As they learn to work together, bandits, witches, invaders, and the creatures of the deep forest stand between them and the castle at Eamhain many miles away. 
Searching for a way through the wilderness, Dar and Fayette discover the means to reach their goal in each other. As they race against time, they must reach the Duchess and warn her before the next attack." />
