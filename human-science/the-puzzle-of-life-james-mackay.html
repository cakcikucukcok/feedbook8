  <title>The Puzzle of Life - James Mackay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What does it mean to have a life? While science attempts to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and the wonders of the creature we call a human being, religion remains rooted in the dogmas of the past. But religion endures as a powerful force throughout the world, and many of its tenets are forever relevant to human existence.
Conflicts continue to rage across many regions of our planet, and millions of people still live in constant fear. We need scientists and theologians to help us understand the human condition, but we also need good leaders to navigate the human race through the dangerous waters to come. Do our experiences of the 20th century offer any hope for the 21st?
Can science and religion ever be reconciled, and will the nations of the world one day be able to live together in harmony? Can mankind ever solve the puzzle of life?
This book explores these and other questions; its ambition is to throw some light on what it means to be alive at the beginning of the 21st century.
Science is explained in terms that should be understandable to everyone, and mathematics does not feature at all." />
