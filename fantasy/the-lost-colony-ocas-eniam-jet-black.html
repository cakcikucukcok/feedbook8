  <title>The Lost Colony - Ocas Eniam, Jet Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As soon as Mark breaks free of his cocoon, he is ready to explore the world around him. Together, with the newest members of his colony, he begins to discover what life is like for an ant as he becomes familiar with his roles and responsibilities. He is making friends and training for his new life when a sudden encounter with a feathered creature is going to change everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carried away from his colony by a bird who drops him into her nest, Mark gets away and tumbles to the ground. He is soon discovered by two strange ants who attempt to help him find his way back to the Morrie Colony. As Mark begins his desperate journey to return to the only home he knows, he must learn to rely on himself and the other creatures he meets along the way to survive the elements, impending danger, and his own navet. Unsure of how to protect himself against anything, Mark struggles to stay alive in the face of a myriad of adventures and risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fantasy tale, a tiny ant must learn to be independent, strong, and overcome his fears as he faces the impossible and discovers his true destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
