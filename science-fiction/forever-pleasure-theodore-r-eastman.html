  <title>Forever Pleasure - Theodore R. Eastman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this futuristic novel, John Seeger accidentally travels from 1986 to 2076 and lands in a revolutionary society where he soon manages to blend in with the utopian lifestyle. Seeger eventually discovers that past influences have left all the intelligent life forms of the local universe converted into euphoric machines.
Jeso, a euphoric robot housing a human mind, has a grand plan to spread his Hedonistic Expansion crusade over the vast Local Group of galaxies via his vintage spacecraft, La Cielo, built three millenniums ago. Seeger realizes that robots have the capability to devour and reconstruct cities and microbots can take over anyone&#39;s emotions in this strange new world where money and property are of no value. After he falls in love with a beautiful woman, Mahea, Seeger inadvertently changes the course of his future in a perfect world as he uncovers a deep secret. Meanwhile, Seeger&#39;s beloved sister, Kayla, is still living in 1986, trapped in a bad marriage and in failing health, and Seeger must choose between returning to his former world or moving on with his new life.
Jeso and Seeger&#39;s paths eventually converge and take them on a collision course that, in the end, will decide the future of their universe." />
