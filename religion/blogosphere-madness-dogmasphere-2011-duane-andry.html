  <title>Blogosphere Madness:  Dogmasphere 2011 - Duane Andry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Continuing the extract from the Blog (http://s201453435.onlinehome. Duane Andry
us/); these are More Ravings of a Religious Fanatic. These topics are
edgy--while maintaining spiritual accuracy--analyses of religious principles,
practices and doctrine: Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:
I came not to send peace, but a sword. (Matthew 10:34)
Our destination is this:
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on
the breastplate of righteousness;
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
And take the helmet of salvation,
and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
(Ephesians 6:14-17)
These are tools to strengthen the thrust of the sword of the Spirit. However,
you cannot just repeat what you read here; rather, you must also apply
Scripture: Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they
are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
(1 John 4:1)
Do not let circumstances push you to the point of accepting mediocrity in
worship. Regardless of the challenge that faces you, stay strong in the Lord;
keeping the example of the life of the apostle Paul in mind, as a reminder
of the grace that allows us to overcome any contrary persuasion.
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above
measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
from me.
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength
is made perfect in weakness.
Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power
of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities,
in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs
sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
(2 Corinthians 12:1-10)" />
