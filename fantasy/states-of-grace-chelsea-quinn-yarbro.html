  <title>States of Grace - Chelsea Quinn Yarbro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Franzicco Ragoczy di Santo-Germano is a successful merchant in Venice. His lavish lifestyle and rumored cache of magnificent jewels have attracted the wrong sort of attention, and without Santo-Germano&#39;s noble--and papal--connections, he might be imprisoned, his property confiscated. Also under surveillance is the vampire&#39;s mistress, the lovely and talented musician Pier-Ariana Salier. &lt;br&gt;Elsewhere, Ragoczy&#39;s publishing business is being investigated by the Inquisition. Erneste van Amsteljaxter, a writer whose intelligence Ragoczy finds attractive, is tarred with the brush of heresy. Ragoczy is trying to help her, when he learns that Pier-Ariana has disappeared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in Venice Santo-Germano finds that his fortune has been embezzled, and that he is accused of kidnapping, and possibly murdering, a young man who had been spying on the vampire and his mistress. Another spy has discovered Santo-Germano&#39;s true nature and intends to kill him before he can feast on all of Venice!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
