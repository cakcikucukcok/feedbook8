      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seven minutes in heaven never felt so good...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Valerie Barkin and Alec Rogers survived bullies, awful parents, and seriously shitty social standing the only way best friends can--together. But with the unexpected sexual tension suddenly flaring between them, surviving their ten-year high school reunion might be a different story...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Val hasn&#39;t changed. She still feels like the stringy-haired band geek the popular kids teased, but Alec has definitely changed. He&#39;s now the front man for the Grammy-winning rock band Chronic Disharmony, with the sexual reputation to match. And he&#39;s more than willing to help Val rock the reunion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then it happens--a drunken game of Seven Minutes in Heaven--and their fourteen-years-long foreplay comes crashing to the forefront...changing everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven minutes turns into a weekend of mind-blowing, no-strings-attached sex. But these best friends won&#39;t be able to leave their hearts out of it forever, not when the most meaningful benefit could change their relationship for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Most Likely To series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Best Friends with Benefits &lt;br&gt;Book #2 Wrong Bed Reunion&lt;/p&gt;" />
