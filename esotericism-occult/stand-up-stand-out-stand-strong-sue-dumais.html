  <title>Stand UP, Stand OUT, Stand STRONG - Sue Dumais</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover the power of a change in perspective and come to see that as long as we are fighting to be right we will always feel wrong. Discover how to stop taking everything so personally by using our own judgments to move us from brutal honesty to radical honesty. Learn how we are all born innocent but programmed guilty and that a healthy expression of anger and asking for help is an act of courage. See how we are more connected than we are separate and if we want the world to change we need to change our view of the world and become part of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;
Sue won&amp;rsquo;t tell us what we want to hear but she tells us what we need to hear. It has become clear&amp;mdash;what used to work is no longer working. We are dying to feel alive. We are at a pivotal choice point and each of us holds the potential to unify humanity and free us all. The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need us to fit in, it needs each one of us to stand up, stand out and stand strong. Hope for humanity lies in our willingness to embody our heart YES and answer the call for love. This book is a thirty-day road map to change minds and open hearts to create a ripple effect that has the potential to heal the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
