  <title>Above His Proper Station - Lawrence Watt-Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anrel Murau, a simple scholar, is secretly the notorious revolutionary Alvos the Orator--the Empire&#39;s most wanted man. On the run and nearly penniless, Anrel finds himself forced to seek refuge in the capital city&#39;s Pensioner&#39;s Quarter, a den of thieves, murderers, and con men. Barely scraping out an existence on the fringe of respectable society, Anrel never forgets his demands for justice, nor the love of the woman he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil unrest that has long been simmering in the Empire is beginning to boil over into violent protests and Anrel&#39;s enemy, Lord Allutar, continues to corrupt the Grand Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Anrel&#39;s alter-ego, Alvos the Orator, has taken on a life of his own and many factions of the Grand Council seek a way to harness his followers&#39; political might for their own ends. Which means they need Anrel to take on a surprising new role and gain access to one of the Empire&#39;s greatest secrets to stop the rampant evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adventure of Alvos the Orator continues with more action, more intrigue, and more suspense than ever before as Anrel seeks to at last clear his name and seek retribution against his old enemy once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
