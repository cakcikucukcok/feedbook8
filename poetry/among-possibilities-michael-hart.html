  <title>Among Possibilities - Michael Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Among Possibilities was written in February and March of 2000. It is not uniform in mood. But the basic message, I think, is the same: reflection gives us reason to hope and abandon irrational fears. I am not an optimist by natureperhaps to my own detriment. But always anticipating bad things in a mood of gloom is self-destructive. I reflect on lifes ups and downsmostly downsand come to the conclusion that what matters, is that almost in any situation (perhaps even almost is just a pessimists cautious crutch) good possibilities are present. The promise of better things to come is always there, in some sense. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The book is in rhymed verse. I am a traditionalist that way. Among Possibilities, like the rest of my poetry, places content above style and linguistic innovations. However, the style is bolder than my first poetry book. The range of subjects is not very great. I intentionally selected only those poems for this book that are quite personal. Therein lies a uniqueness of Among Possibilities: while reading this book, you may catch me now strolling, now hobbling, now running through its pages, wearing my heart of a sleeve.&lt;/P&gt;" />
