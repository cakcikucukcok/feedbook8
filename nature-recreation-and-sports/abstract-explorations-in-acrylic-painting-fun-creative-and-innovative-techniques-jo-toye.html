  <title>Abstract Explorations in Acrylic Painting: Fun, Creative and Innovative Techniques - Jo Toye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Discover abstract painting with acrylics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;If you approach your art with a playful attitude you will be more apt to keep making art, and the more art you make, the better your art will be.&amp;quot; --pg. 10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like a diving board for creativity, &lt;i&gt;Abstract Explorations in Acrylic Painting&lt;/i&gt; will help you plunge joyfully into artmaking. With the belief that an attitude of playfulness is key to artistic growth, award-winning acrylic artist Jo Toye leads you on an engaging workshop-style adventure filled with innovative techniques, inventive approaches and breakthrough results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work Small.&lt;/b&gt; Start by discovering how working on a small canvas yields big payoffs. When you don&amp;#39;t have anything to lose but a few minutes and a little piece of paper, you&amp;#39;ll find that you paint more fearlessly, absorb new concepts faster and enjoy yourself more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step-by-Step Instruction.&lt;/b&gt; Learn what tools Toye finds most useful in making art, along with 17 step-by-step demonstrations showing how to use them to best effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start-to-Finish Painting Projects.&lt;/b&gt; At the heart of the book, 8 start-to-finish painting projects put it all together. Discover fresh takes on stenciling, sponging, making and working with gesso. Use razor blades and applicator bottles to create distinctive linework. Achieve wonderfully original patterns using resist pens, mouth atomizers and India ink. Experiment with Clear Tar Gel, pour paint with pipettes, work over top a &amp;quot;failed&amp;quot; painting...all yielding brilliantly original results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Heavily illustrated and filled with exciting ideas you won&amp;#39;t find anywhere else, &lt;i&gt;Abstract Explorations in Acrylic Painting&lt;/i&gt; will inspire you to paint, experiment, play...and come away with some of your best work yet!&lt;/div&gt;" />
