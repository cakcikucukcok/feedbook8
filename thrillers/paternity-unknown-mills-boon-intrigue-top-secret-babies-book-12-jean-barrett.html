          &lt;strong&gt;WHO&#39;S THE FATHER?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gossips in Lauren McCrea&#39;s small town speculated about the identity of her baby&#39;s father. But not even the daddy knew. And if her daughter hadn&#39;t been kidnapped, he never would have….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Coming face-to-face with Lauren was like a sucker punch to the gut for Ethan Brand. Yet that was nothing compared to the bomb she dropped in his lap–their night of passion had resulted in a child! Now uncovering the secrets of his past was on hold as he rushed to save his little girl. But was his fragile new family in danger because she was &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; child?&lt;/p&gt;
