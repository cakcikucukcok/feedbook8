  <title>Sensational Poems of Valu Helu from Tonga - &#39;Anaseini Fale-&#39;o-valu &#39; Aisea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My compact book of poetries, the first version of which is with you now, has been originally written in December of 2003, but there are many lost poems that I had written when I was still in high school, starting in 1997. 
I started writing poetries as a way of trying to escape the deep feelings of happiness and calmness so that I would not have hysteria or hyper and, of course, not forgetting sadness or regret both as in my relationship with any member of my family or friends, especially my mother, who had been always fed up with us kids on refusing to give her any help in doing chores at home. Always from Mondays to Sundays, we always spent ourselves times on study and nothing else, and the language she had always said to us had trained me to visualize and criticize and embrace everything in a hidden, deep, and creative thoughts just to mesmerize the idea of a beautiful life because many of the words she said to us were bad complaints. 
Well, that was instigated by sadness, and as for regret, my relationship with friends included boyfriends as recently happening started in 1998. I was not enjoying school without having to have a boyfriend, which was the main reason for it was to keep me away from missing Dad, who passed away in 2000. But the relationships were very childish and juvenile. I followed many principles of my father because he has always been my happiness and pacification, and one of the principles he taught me is never to have sex with any men until I get married. And that is also the main principle in our culture for every female in a family, but as recently, as I have inclined to elaborate upon on above, I guess I became obsessed with love matters. 
It was during my last year at the university. In 2002 I started to understand how to really love, and my conclusion for that is that if I want to love and be loved, I have to love everybody who is a friend or family or relative. But more than that, I must love myself first above everything else in order for myself to love everyone else that I know; and that was why I decided to write all the poems that are included in my compact book of poems." />
