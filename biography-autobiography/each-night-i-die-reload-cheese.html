  <title>Each Night, I Die: Reload - Cheese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="EACH NIGHT I DIE is the authors true story about how he and his family coped as best they could with his confused and destructive leap into manhood until one by one, they could cope no more.  On the other hand, it shows that an absent father, a poor working mother, neighborhood of despair, inadequate education and destructive streets do not have to determine the fate of every urban child in America; that fate lies within.
The authors life is a microcosm of many southern families who migrated North in search of a better life.  This book is for everyone, regardless of ethnicity or background; and relates to all human emotions:  Its about tragedy and triumph, hope and hopelessness, addiction and recovery, faith and fear, life and death, choices and consequences, so it appeals to a diverse audience.  A man is not finished when he is defeated; he is only finished when he himself throw in the towel.
The author believes his message is a timely one, and our past is over, and should not enslave us for the rest of our lives.  No one is beyond the power of redemption, and I believe my life was spared to tell my story, as I remember all of the many lives lost to drugs, prison, and violence; not to mention, the potentials that ended all too soon in a cold, damp grave." />
