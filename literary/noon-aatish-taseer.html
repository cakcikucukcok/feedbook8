  <title>Noon - Aatish Taseer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rehan Tabassum has grown up in a world of privilege in Delhi. His mother and her new husband embody the dazzling emergent India everyone is talking about. His real father, however, is a virtual stranger to him: a Pakistani Muslim who lives across the border and owns a vast telecommunications empire called Qasimic Call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Rehan contemplates his future, he finds himself becoming unmoored. Leaving the familiarity of home for Pakistan in an attempt to get closer to his father, he is drawn into events he barely understands. His half brother, Isffy, is being blackmailed; his powerful father&#39;s entourage is tearing itself apart; and the city of Port Bin Qasim, where he finds himself, is filled with rioting protestors. Moral danger lurks in every corner of this dark, shifting, and unfamiliar world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the background of a turbulent Pakistan and a rapidly changing India, &lt;i&gt;Noon &lt;/i&gt;is a startling and powerfully charged novel from a brilliant young writer. Aatish Taseer bears witness to some of the most urgent questions of our times, questions about nationhood and violence, family and identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
