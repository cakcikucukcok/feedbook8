  <title>Adnan&#39;s Triad - Donna Siepiela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adnans Triad is a bold and empowering journey of adult escapist fiction with eccentric and eclectic characters that take the reader to a modern paradise carved out of the hills and woods. It is set in modern times in the rural United States with a refreshing slant on numerous topics. A life changing read for everyone that inspires both women and men to greater heights. 
 	Daring and lighthearted characters walk through lifes many challenges. A fascinating read full of twists and turns. In her latest book, Donna Siepiela has crossed more than one line while writing this honest tale of three people who wind up walking the same road together. Often passionate and sometimes funny, it is an enthralling story of issues both ancient and current. A relaxing and entertaining fantasy that takes the reader away to a place where being human is accepted and celebrated, and co-existing with nature is the key to survival.
	The book, also, has a wealth of information on various topics from raising birds, to planting trees, and fixing cars. It even has a few recipes! It is destined to become a classic with a place next to Fanny Hill, but much easier to read." />
