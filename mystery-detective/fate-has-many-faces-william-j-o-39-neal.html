  <title>Fate Has Many Faces - William J. O&#39;Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Had the perfect crime been achieved? Three months had passed and the
trail was cold or was there any trial to follow? Could one man be smart
enough to plan and carry out a heist of this magnitude? Just who was
this Tallmadge McGee anyway? Was he basking in sunshine on a peaceful
island sipping on his ice-tea with hula girls at his beck and call? Could he
live long enough to spend his millions or was he already buried under a
slab of cement. The FBI was stymied, and a wall of doubt grew. Would the
crime ever be solved? One thing was a positi ve, the underwriters were
screaming for results.
Were a generous retainer and the possibility of a half million-dollar
reward enti cing enough for Duncan Luce to commit himself to the case?
Yes he decided, Internati onal Investi gators Inc. was the granddaddy of all
investi gati on agencies that existed outside of the government society.
This would open the fi nal door of his profession. For them to seek out his
services was a star in his crown. Already the juices were fl owing.
Brace yourself Mr. McGhee this is going to be interesti ng. Duncan Luce has
taken up the hunt." />
