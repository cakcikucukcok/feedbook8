  <title>He...Who...! the Christ Verses - Benjamin C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He...Who...! The Christ Verses, is a collection of ninety-six dramatic poetic verses, in ten chapters, on the role of the universal Christ spirit, as exemplified in His life, death, and
resurrection. Various events, stories, and messages about Jesus Christ are told via
simple, beautiful poetry, rich in rhyme, rhythm, and imagery. Some of the early verses take us deep into the wonders of creation, evolution, and the meaning and purpose of life and death. They take you on a chronological voyage into the Christ experience, his teachings, miracles, morals and values. They cover events on the triumphs of early Christianity, and culminate in life salvation and life eternal.
The verses are introduced and framed in a story of a wise old man is who is dying and sought out by the entire village to share with them a parting message of wisdom and faith. This old sage thus delivers by way of poetic verses, his message of hope and salvation via the Christ experience.
HeWho! Uniquely chooses to use poetry as its means of communication based on the premise that people, young and old, can more easily read and remember simple poetry. Point in case Jesus loves me. This I know. And, Now I lay me down to sleep..
The verses will excite and stimulate thought and discussion and appeal to both young and old. They present a fresh, unique vehicle as a lead-in to educational and scriptural lessons, with easy cross-reference to biblical text. 
The book once read, becomes one of on-going and continued value for occasional browsing,
noting and memorizing your favorite verses. They lend well to personal, private readings or to public citations, when read aloud to family or friends. Spend the time to wander through the pages, discovering and re-discovering the spiritual lessons and landmarks laid down for us by Christ.
You thus have your invitation to take this exciting journey and witness the most extraordinary life ever lived, and the greatest story, ever told. It is my hope that this work helps many to more rationally investigate to fully understand just who He is, and especially in regards to mans creation and ultimate destiny. To Him goes the credit for His guidance in the writing and publication of this, His story and the messages of peace, faith and salvation, so much needed in these perilous times.
May God Bless.
