  <title>Dystopia - Spider Hacksaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lock Crick has returned home to his friends, after serving thirteen months of punishment and pain, for the accidental killing of a hitchhiker, on a dark country road, in the pouring rain.
Now, games and masks and nightmares of six friends&#39; shared past, conspire and collide, as childhood demons taunt and hide, on this Halloween night and the eve of winter&#39;s bane.
A welcome home celebration and a trick or treat incantation, turns rotten and rank, during a party prank, when an uninvited guest ends up slain.
Another accident? Murder maybe? Is it Owen Poe&#39;s blood or a fake blood stain? Because now his body is missing, and good friends are acting strange.
Raven Cathmore and her grown-up orphan friends must learn the rules of insanity and the reality of someone&#39;s twisted game. As the snowfall grows steeper and the body-part pile gets deeper, someone is playing for keeps, and one of them is to blame." />
