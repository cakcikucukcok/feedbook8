  <title>Anything for an A - Guy New York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="English isn&amp;#39;t my thing. It&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t like it, or don&amp;#39;t like my teacher, but it&amp;#39;s just never been my specialty. So, when I got a letter from my college of choice telling me I had better shape up or kiss my acceptance goodbye, I did what anyone would do: I tried to sleep with my teacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. McGrath, on the other hand, turned out to be a tougher nut to crack. Suddenly I was stuck with one option: I had to make it impossible for him to turn me down, and that meant putting in some serious effort and creativity. So, three Polaroids later, an anonymous letter, some kiss prints, and some real tears, and I was on my way to a recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But things didn&amp;#39;t work exactly like I expected. Of course. They did get hot, and I definitely got more than I bargained for, but let&amp;#39;s just say that by the end of the story it was hard to tell who was seducing who.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re curious to see exactly how my teacher responded to my advances you&amp;#39;ll just have to buy the book. If it&amp;#39;s not clear from the cover, this is a very naughty book intended for grownups." />
