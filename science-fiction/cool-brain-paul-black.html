      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WELCOME TO SPOOKSVILLE&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;What if you knew what a friend, or a lover, or a client was thinking? Would it empower you or drive you crazy? For Dillon Bradford, hearing people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts has proved monumentally profitable. Dillon is a cool hunter and has leveraged his telepathic ability into Cool Brain, one of Dallas&amp;rsquo; largest and most successful brand design agencies. Dillon isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one wielding this remarkable gift, however. Other telepaths are living large in Big D, and Dillon has brought them together for fun and profit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But Dillon&amp;rsquo;s tony life begins to unravel when an intriguing woman joins his special group. Debra Lao works for Ewing Pharmaceuticals, one of CoolBrain&amp;rsquo;s largest accounts. At first, she seems the perfect addition, but after a few drinks, Dillon discovers Lao has a unique sexual twist on their telepathic gift. Inexorably drawn to this exotic Asian beauty, Dillon soon finds his world turned inside out. Blackouts. Seizures. Mysterious marks at the base of his skull. What is happening to Dillon Bradford? Is Debra Lao what she seems? Is his life what it seems?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dallas&amp;rsquo; most eligible bachelor is about to be thrust into the dangerous and seedy world of international arms trade and black operations, and there&amp;rsquo;s seemingly nothing he can do to stop it, because Dillon Bradford&amp;rsquo;s gift isn&amp;rsquo;t like his telepathic&amp;nbsp;friends&amp;rsquo; and rival forces scattered around the globe will do whatever it takes to harness his extraordinary power.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From two-time Independent Publishers Book Award winner, Paul Black, comes a thriller that is sure to win with critics and audiences.
