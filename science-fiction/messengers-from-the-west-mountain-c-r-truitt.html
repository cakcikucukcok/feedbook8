  <title>Messengers from the West Mountain - C. R. Truitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Great Fire War had once scorched the earth, leaving it barren for generations and only those who took refuse underground were their childrens children able to live once again upon the surface of the earth. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	For years the West Mountain people lived pleasantly on the surface of the earth outside of the Mother Cave, until reports from the other Warrior tribes told of attacks from a people who still use the ancient machines to capture and enslave. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	The Chiefs daughter, Paula was delighted when the Council announced she would lead and be sent with three others as messengers to the other Warrior tribes for a call of unity to stand against these invaders. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	She set out with her best friend Sissy, a young healer, her cousin Mira, the best warrior of her tribe, and their friend, Peggy. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	Together they set out to warn the other tribes, but separated to make up for lost time waiting for Paula and Peggy to heal after a battle with mutated men. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Paula and Sissy catch a ride in the wasteland and unknowingly find themselves in the enemy territory. There they find danger and unexpected allies.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
All four of us sat erect, pushing our chests out, holding our heads high, riding through the main street with our people cheering us...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is nothing like the adorations of our family and peers. How soon we would come to learn the difference of people who would not see us so, regarding us as their prey or their enemy, to use us whatever way they could. Leaving the tribe behind, we had no knowledge of that. We were sure of our skills and our persons...

He glared at me, his voice deepened, commanding. You will hand me that chain and then you will strip and put hose dirty rags in this basket. Now!...

His retaliation was swift. He slapped me hard enough to bring me to my knees with my eyes watering and my cheek stinging..." />
