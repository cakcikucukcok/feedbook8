  <title>The Ambassadors: Kingdom of Man - Jim Crowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cutting across the categories, this is a new kind of &quot;science-fiction thriller&quot; and a fast-moving all-action adventure novel of ideas. It is about the world we have created here on Earth, and about friendship, trust and betrayal.  The narrative explores what might happen if and when alien beings make their first contact with us. As their strange craft enters our atmosphere and the world holds its breath, the nations of the world go on high alert and mobilise their armies. But the aliens claim to come in peace. They claim to need our help. They claim they will, in return, help us.   Governments around the world grow increasingly concerned, but this story is about action, and it never deviates from a close study of the handful of people directly involved in this enormous clash of cultures and the problems they face.  Are the aliens friendly? Will they share their incredible technology and their frightening weapons with us, or do they have another agenda entirely?" />
