  <title>Tuck - Stephen Lawhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Pray God our aim is true and each arrow finds its mark.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Raven has brought hope to the oppressed people of Wales--and fear to their Norman overlords. Deceived by the self-serving King William and hunted by the treacherous Abbot Hugo and Sheriff de Glanville, Rhi Bran is forced again to take matters into his own hands as King Raven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way Friar Tuck has been the stalwart supporter of the man behind the legend--bringing Rhi Bran much-needed guidance, wit, and faithful companionship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by Tuck and his small but determined band of forest-dwelling outlaws, Rhi Bran ignites a rebellion that spreads through the Welsh valleys, forcing the wily monarch to marshal his army and march against little Elfael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This epic trilogy dares to shatter everything you thought you knew about Robin Hood as Stephen R. Lawhead conjures an ancient past while holding a mirror to contemporary realities. Filled with unforgettable characters, breathtaking suspense, and rousing battle scenes, Stephen R. Lawhead&#39;s masterful retelling of the Robin Hood legend reaches its stunning conclusion in &lt;em&gt;Tuck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
