  <title>Crow After Roe - Jessica  Mason Pieklo, Robin Marty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;2013 will mark the fortieth anniversary of &lt;I&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/I&gt;, one of the most divisive rulings ever to shape American politics. In recent years, attempts to overturn &lt;I&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/I&gt; have reached a fevered pitch. Since 2010 hundreds of bills banning or creating roadblocks to abortion access, contraception, and basic women&amp;#8217;s health have been proposed across the United States, with nearly one hundred new laws going into effect. The goal is to create a law that will eventually be brought before the most conservative Supreme Court ever to occupy the bench, in order to overturn &lt;I&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Crow After Roe: How &amp;#147;Separate But Equal&amp;#8221; Has Become the New Standard In Women&#39;s Health And How We Can Change That&lt;/I&gt; takes a look at twelve states that since 2010 have each passed a different anti-abortion or anti-women&#39;s health law, and how each law is explicitly written to provoke a repeal of &lt;I&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/I&gt;. The book will detail not just the history of the laws in question, but how they challenge &lt;I&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/I&gt; and create a reproductive health care system that puts women&amp;#151;especially poor, rural, or those of color&amp;#151;into a separate class with fewer choices or control.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Robin Marty &lt;/B&gt;is RH Reality Check&#39;s senior political reporter, focusing primarily on state legislation restricting women&amp;#8217;s reproductive rights.
