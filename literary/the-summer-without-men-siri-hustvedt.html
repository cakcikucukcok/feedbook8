  <title>The Summer Without Men - Siri Hustvedt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;And who among us would deny Jane Austen her happy endings or insist that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne should get back together at the end of&lt;/i&gt; The Awful Truth&lt;i&gt;? There are tragedies and there are comedies, aren&#39;t there? And they are often more the same than different, rather like men and women, if you ask me. A comedy depends on stopping the story at exactly the right moment.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mia Fredrickson, the wry, vituperative, tragic comic, poet narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Summer Without Men&lt;/i&gt;, has been forced to reexamine her own life. One day, out of the blue, after thirty years of marriage, Mia&#39;s husband, a renowned neuroscientist, asks her for a &quot;pause.&quot; This abrupt request sends her reeling and lands her in a psychiatric ward. The June following Mia&#39;s release from the hospital, she returns to the prairie town of her childhood, where her mother lives in an old people&#39;s home. Alone in a rented house, she rages and fumes and bemoans her sorry fate. Slowly, however, she is drawn into the lives of those around her--her mother and her close friends,&quot;the Five Swans,&quot; and her young neighbor with two small children and a loud angry husband--and the adolescent girls in her poetry workshop whose scheming and petty cruelty carry a threat all their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;What I Loved &lt;/i&gt;comes Siri Hustvedt&#39;s provocative, witty, and revelatory novel about women and girls, love and marriage, and the age-old question of sameness and difference between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
