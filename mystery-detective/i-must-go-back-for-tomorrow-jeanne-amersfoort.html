  <title>I Must Go Back for Tomorrow - Jeanne Amersfoort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Doctor, Ive been on the pill for years and youre telling me Im pregnant? A few weeks later, her doctor recommends Lola to have an abortion because of fetus distress. She says, No way! &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lola sees the life of her now-grown daughter, young, healthy, brilliant, and successful, slowly being dissolved by drugs. Her daughters living death and the horrors that come along for a free ride to hell are all but consuming Lola, her husband, and their other daughter and her family as well. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning, Lola reads an article about a scientific project experimenting with time travel. Secretly, Lola volunteers to travel back in time thirty years, to the day she turned down the abortion. This time she takes the doctors advice. Returning, she finds the undoing of her daughter is causing unimaginable consequences and horrors, touching her family and many others. Lola believes the only way out is to go back and undo what she has done. However, it seems that may not be possible. She calls on God to please open the way for her to undo the hell she herself has brought to pass by undoing what God had created. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cries out, I must go back for tomorrow. Lola finds that Gods grace and mercies are more than enough to deal with her daughters trialsall the way to victory! &lt;p&gt;" />
