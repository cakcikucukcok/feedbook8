  <title>The Wiccan Minister&#39;s Manual, a Guide for Priests and Priestesses - Kevin M. Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&quot;The Wiccan Minister&#39;s Manual, A Guide For Priests and
Priestesses, &quot; was inspired as a training aid for those who would like to
become Wiccan Ministers, as well as an aid for Wiccan/Pagan Priests and
Priestesses. The Craft is evolving, becoming more and more accepted by society,
and there is beginning to be a definite distinction between Wiccan Laity and
Wiccan Clergy. Part One - Guidance - Making the spiritual connection to
personal deity through love, prayer, meditation, ritual, and myth and how to
guide others to create their own personal connections. Part Two - Wiccan
religious philosophy and guidance - How to live a spiritual life in the modern
world. Part Three - various methods of healing mind, body and spirit -
Including some legal pit-falls to avoid, plus chapter eleven presents an
extensive discourse on Pastoral Counseling. Part Four deals with psychic
self-defense and rituals of protection. Including House Clearings, Banishings,
and Exorcism. Additionally, the author explains what to look for and what to
look out for while determining if an exorcism is really needed or if the client
is suffering from psychosis and is in need of a professional therapist. Part
Five focuses upon the spiritual support roles. It covers, dealing with death
and dying, Funerals, Prison Ministry, Legal requirements of doing Handfastings
in all 50 states, plus a discourse on whether or not to incorporate. This work
begins to fill yet another gap in this area of the Wiccan religious structure
as it brings back much of the older knowledge and philosophy that seems to be
waning from the collective Wiccan memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Reviewed by Edain McCoy; &quot;Kevin, I received my copy of
&quot;Wiccan Minister&#39;s Manual Its terrific! You cover everything...
Personally, I think you did a great job at making your book useful to all
trads.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
