  <title>Wicked Greed - Stephen Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Bradford T. Young found himself at the epicenter of Florida&#39;s overheated real estate market, he plunged into the universal greed trap - a craving quest for piles of money, corrupting power and seductive women. But that was before his guilty nightmares began . . . and before Amanda &quot;Mandy&quot; Grant, a tabloid investigative reporter, unwittingly placed a mystical spell over him. Brad is soon forced to make a life-altering choice - slide further into an abyss of greed or pursue a fleeting opportunity to earn Mandy&#39;s love which he also covets. Brad&#39;s quandary intensifies when Mandy&#39;s investigation uncovers and exposes the illicit inner workings of the corrupt organization he now works for. As Mandy garners the wrath of a New York mobster and his evil empire, only Brad as a &quot;company insider&quot; can save her from the unfathomable terror that follows. In a cunning cat and mouse gambit, Brad must race to beat organized crime at its own wicked game, as David pitted against Goliath with death or love hanging in the balance." />
