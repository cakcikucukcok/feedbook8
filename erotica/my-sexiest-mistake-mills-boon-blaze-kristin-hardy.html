  <title>My Sexiest Mistake (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Kristin Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;A simple mistake…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A sexy mistake…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In fact, it would be the most incredibly sexy mistake of their lives. One minute, Cade Douglas, delectable Boston businessman, is signaling for a waitress in the bar of a very fashionable hotel. The next, he&#39;s nearly racing upstairs with a beautiful stranger, who&#39;d answered his summons instead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gorgeous Ryan Donnelly can&#39;t believe it&#39;s all happened so smoothly. Before arriving, she had imagined how awkward it would be to meet the gigolo who&#39;d been hired for her. Her gigolo. Her secret lover. The one who would ignite the intense passion she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was the one, the one who would fill his senses, save his soul. Cade was certain of it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was &lt;em&gt;the one&lt;/em&gt;, summoning her so casually, so confidently. Ryan was certain of it, of him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;If they&#39;d only known.&lt;/em&gt;
