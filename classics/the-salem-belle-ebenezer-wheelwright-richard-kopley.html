  <title>The Salem Belle - Ebenezer Wheelwright, Richard Kopley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Salem Belle&lt;/em&gt; is a historical novel, a tale of vengeance and superstition set against the Salem witchcraft tragedy of 1692. Rejected by the beautiful Mary&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;the Salem belle&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the bitter Trellison accuses her of witchcraft, mistakenly thinking himself motivated by religious faith. She is quickly tried and convicted, and her brother James and her fianc&amp;eacute;, Walter, must try to rescue the persecuted woman. Engaging in its own right, &lt;em&gt;The Salem Belle&lt;/em&gt; invites renewed interest because it is a critical source for Nathaniel Hawthorne&amp;rsquo;s masterwork, &lt;em&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/em&gt;. Hawthorne transformed three scenes from Wheelwright&amp;rsquo;s novel for his own. In so doing, Hawthorne covertly elaborated his lifelong theme: original sin and the possibility of redemption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne scholar Richard Kopley, who has recovered &lt;em&gt;The Salem Belle&lt;/em&gt; for twenty-first-century literary study, introduces and annotates Wheelwright&amp;rsquo;s novel, providing relevant historical details as well as pertinent details about Wheelwright&amp;rsquo;s life and reading. Kopley also furnishes three appendixes that will facilitate understanding of &lt;em&gt;The Salem Belle&lt;/em&gt; and further analysis of its place in American literary history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
