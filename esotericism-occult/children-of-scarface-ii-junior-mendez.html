  <title>Children of Scarface Ii - Junior Mendez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book titled; Children of Scarface II subtitled; Am I My Brothers Keeper is a continuation of the saga started in the nonfiction book titled; My Little Garden of Eden subtitled; Im god, were all gods. Still to come in the trilogy is the book titled: The Tree of Life with the subtitle, healing of the nation. These books narrated to contrast the godly and the ungodly secular lifestyles, with biblical doctrines and principles. The atrocities mentioned in Children of Scarface II are real, they essentially occurred in Upstate and Western New York, Mexico, Canada, and in the wilderness of Jamaica. These atrocities are recounted in this book as reported and published by the various news media, and they are available public records.
      Scarfaces grandmother named Lola, pregnant when she runaway from the wilderness of Duckenfield, to the perilous streets of central Kingston, in Jamaica. She made her way to Rochester, New York; and found refuge amongst a bunch of Rastafarian dreadlocks from Jamaica; they lived in a large house on Terry Street, off Jefferson Avenue. Shortly after Lola gave birth to Scarfaces father in Rochester, Prince, a notorious drug lord from the wilderness, came in search of Lola and the baby. 
      Having a father and a mother living together were the happiest days of Scarfaces childhood, but it did not last for long. Scarfaces father suddenly gunned down in the streets of Rochester, New York. Shortly after that, Scarfaces mother vanished from the streets of the Rochester community. Scarface became an orphan, a motherless and a fatherless child, without any known family member who was not a drug addict, or an alcoholic, or a drug trafficker." />
