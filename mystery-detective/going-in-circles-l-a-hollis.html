There isnt a female on or off campus who is immune to the suave brothers legendary tactics with the fairer sex. Bruce is the leader of the group and his words are considered golden by those wanting to perfect their playah skills. The smooth talking brothers popular handbook for lesser men, titled, The Playahs Guide for Dummies, is a much sought after publication by the male student body on campus.

&lt;p&gt;Amber is Bruces younger sister and she sets her sights on his best friend, Marcus. Marcus has managed in the past to fend off his numerous admirers until she appears on the scene. An instant attraction sparks a lively romance. As the lovers set off on a funny, touching, journey of the heart, their relationship is wrenched from them through tragic circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve years will pass before the lovers are reunited and given a second chance at the life meant for them so many years before. Will they find the happiness that eluded them in the past?&lt;/p&gt;" />
