  <title>City to City - Pamela Smith Pettway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this story Maggie Mantal a middle-aged woman becomes confused and hallucinatory, traumatized by the death of her three and a half year old son.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As Maggie gradually becomes more attuned to reality; she begins to accept that her son was killed in freak household accident. The distressing aftereffects sends her into a world of inner turmoil and sorrow, her insistence that she can see his disembodied soul suggest a link between the physical and spiritual planes, a connection that Maggie may be acutely aware of, and her eventual recovery is based on the ability to accept the reality of Jacob&#39;s death.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Frank Mantal is Maggie&#39;s husband and he worked for a company called &quot;Building Corporations&quot;. Frank took great care of the family&#39;s finances all the while trying to keep his wife from becoming insane. The things he said to her would sometimes drive her crazy, Frank seen nothing wrong with calling things as they were and that was that, their son Jacob no longer living.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;City to City is based on actual events which were altered by the writer for protection of the actual person. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some events fictionalized. &lt;/P&gt;" />
