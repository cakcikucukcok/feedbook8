  <title>Barry Lawson&#39;s Future - Garry A. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 2121 things are different.
The United States of America is experiencing a Golden
Age. Business and Government operate separately within
boundaries. Poverty, Employment, homelessness, Hunger
and Ignorance are addressed by the government.
A life of meaning and purpose is within the grasp of any
American with the ability and desire to be successful.
In this world of new found freedoms people still push
the limits of their existence.
Crime still exists and thrives in such a society where so
much is placed on being a productive individual who is
able to fulfill personal and grand humanitarian dreams.
Crime provides for many a life of excitement filled with
risky actions, high rewards and loads of adrenaline.
Barry Lawson is a Gambler and auto race enthusiast. He
has risked his life and traveled the world. He is a rudderless
carefree individual who most would agree is not
the ideal citizen. It doesnt matter because he has enough
money and excitement to make him interesting to others.
The problem is that the love of his life has been murdered
and he is committed to avenge his broken heart. The odds
are stacked against him. The Mob still exists and they are
responsible for his pain.
Garry A Johnson weaves a futuristic tale into levels of
business and society where danger looms." />
