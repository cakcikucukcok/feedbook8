          &lt;strong&gt;LONE WOLVES CHASE a.k.a. THE LONER &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No woman had ever gotten through his defenses, and no bright and bouncy do-gooder would ever make him open up. So why was lovely Tessa Rose hanging on Chase&#39;s every word, sending him sweet smiles and popping by his office every chance she got? How much more temptation could a lone wolf take?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The gruff bachelor might once have craved his own happy ending, but his troubled past wouldn&#39;t let him dare to succumb to his ultimate desire. For to make this precious woman his would mean revealing his most scandalous secret. And Chase knew the truth would be something no woman - especially Tess - could ever forgive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE LONE WOLVES:&lt;em&gt; Meet the sexiest, most stubborn males a woman could ever hope to tame!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
