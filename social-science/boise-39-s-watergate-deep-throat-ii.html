  <title>Boise&#39;s Watergate - Deep Throat Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Welcome to Boise,&lt;/b&gt; turn your clock 
    back 250 years... where theres only one branch of government in Idaho, The 
    Bobs: Gov Joe Bob, Senator Billy Bob, and Supreme Court Justice Suzy Bob. 
    What an incestuous mess!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Strap yourself in. Boises 
    Watergate is a political roller coaster. Someone stole $136 million in 
    Public Education funds at University Place -- after tricking the taxpayers 
    into &quot;renting&quot; a new Court House for $100 million. Whodunit? Was it 
    Cryptic Partners or the Boise lawyers or Governor Kempthorne or Colonel 
    Mustard in the Library with a Revolver?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; If you think Boises Watergate cant 
    happen in your city, think again:&lt;/p&gt;
      Floridas Overland Express, FOX, pulled the plug 
      when the estimate for its public-private Florida bullet train ballooned 
      from $4 billion to $13 billion to $40 billion. (FOX was cited as one of 
      Cryptic Partners qualifications to develop Boises Watergate.)&lt;br&gt;
      In Honolulu, Hawaii, 40% of the contractors working 
      on the $1 billion BRT were under investigation, indicted, or convicted for 
      money laundering to local politicians.&lt;br&gt;
      Sioux City, Iowa taxpayers financed a $35 million 
      Theatre-Hotel Complex. Then, public-private developer Cryptic Partners -- 
      who forgot to add the seats, drinking fountains and bathrooms -- defaulted 
      on 67% of the Complex.&lt;br&gt;
      Seattle, Washingtons $2 billion light rail system 
      was derailed when public-private estimates skyrocketed to over $8 billion.
    &lt;p&gt; A recent study, &lt;i&gt;Megaprojects and Risks&lt;/i&gt; 
    (Cambridge University Press), cited the leading cause of public-private 
    failures: &quot;lying&quot; by public-private developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What theyre saying 
    about Boises Watergate...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of course it 
    was a fix. Its an incestuous mess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

    University Place fiasco (source: Idaho Statesman)&lt;/p&gt;

    every skeleton is buried. But I need deepest cover. You cannot reveal 
    anything about me, not even where or how or by what means you obtain info 
    from me. Zip, zilch, zero, nada. You must protect this source even if a
