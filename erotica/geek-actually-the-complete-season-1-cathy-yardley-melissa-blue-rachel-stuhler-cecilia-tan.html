  <title>Geek Actually: The Complete Season 1 - Cathy Yardley, Melissa Blue, Rachel Stuhler, Cecilia Tan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Geek, Actually&lt;/i&gt; is a sexy, geeky contemporary women&#39;s fiction series that follows the lives of five diverse, nerdy women as they navigate work, love, life, and the internet. For fans who love &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt; as well as &lt;i&gt;Star Wars,&lt;/i&gt; for anyone who knows that sci-fi can be sultry and that &quot;gamer&quot; is not gender specific-this serial will turn you on, rile you up, and leave you with five new friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet your new best girlfriends. Michelle is a hard-nosed fantasy and sci-fi editor used to things going her way. Taneesha is a talented video game programmer used to being the odd (wo)man out. Aditi is a fantasy writer on the verge of her big break. Christina is a rebel on the sidelines of Hollywood. And Elli is a fan-of anything and everything that keeps her from &quot;proper adulting.&quot; Together they are Rebel Scum (at least in their shared group chat), and best friends through thick and thin. They might live far apart but through the power of the internet and a shared love of all things geek, they are ready to face the world together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally presented in serial form by Serial Box Publishing, &lt;i&gt;Geek Actually&lt;/i&gt; is brought to you by Cathy Yardley, Melissa Blue, Rachel Stuhler, and Cecilia Tan." />
