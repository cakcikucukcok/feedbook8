  <title>We Keep Our Potato Chips in the Refrigerator - Patricia Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alzheimer&#39;s disease affects millions worldwide, and this figure is compounded by all the involved caregivers, relatives, and friends of those who are afflicted. This touching memoir is about one man, Fred Thompson, who fell victim to this disease, and the reflections of his wife and caregiver, Patricia Cox who learned from daily experience how dilibilating this cruel malady can be. This honest exposure of successes and failures is intended to convey there is no set formula for dealing with dementia, but there is hope available for those who think they are alone in this quest. These candid stories are filled with some humor and profound sadness; some successes and many failures, but with great love and respect for the man Patricia married and the man he eventually became." />
