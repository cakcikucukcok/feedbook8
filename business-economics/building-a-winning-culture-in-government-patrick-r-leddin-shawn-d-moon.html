  <title>Building A Winning Culture In Government - Patrick R. Leddin, Shawn D. Moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Successful Government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;— Our government organizations face political fallout, media scrutiny, reduced funding, and the many challenges involved in motivating large, multi-layered and highly regulated organizations. It’s no surprise that many government organizations report that their employees are less engaged than ever and that leaders feel helpless to change the situation. In many cases, employees and government leaders are caught in a vicious cycle. Performance declines, scrutiny increases, and employee paralysis ensues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you break this cycle and begin building successful government?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You change the mindset from “leaders are a select few in the organization” to “everyone can and should be a leader.” This simple shift is key to building successful government organizations in the 21st century. If every member of the organization is a leader, it enables government organizations to leverage the power of five highly effective and proven FranklinCovey practices that have made private sector organizations successful and are now bringing about positive change in public sector organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five highly effective practices that you will learn in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Building a Winning Culture in Government&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These five practices will transform your government organization into one that is more responsive to the public interest and provide a more rewarding, less stressful, and overall better life for your employees:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 1: Lead with purpose and find your organization&#39;s mission, mantra, or manifesto:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;An engaging mission must appeal to people’s passionate interests, leverage their distinctive talents, satisfy the conscience, and meet a compelling market need. You will learn how to find the voice of the organization and connect and align accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 2: Make the 7 Habits of Highly Successful People your organization&#39;s operating system:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Move the 7 Habits to the next level by learning how to execute your strategy with excellence and precision using the &quot;4 Disciplines of Execution&quot;. Learn the significance of &quot;wildly important goals&quot;, &quot;lead measures&quot;, creating a &quot;compelling scoreboard&quot; and a &quot;cadence of accountability&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 3: Unleash and engage people to do infinitely more than you imagined they could:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You will learn the process for building successful government and reducing stress within your team by applying a system that enables you to &quot;Act on the Important, Don’t React to the Urgent&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 4: Inspire trust and be the most trusted organization possible:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Trust is the great accelerator. Where trust is high, everything is faster and less complicated, and where trust is low, everything is slower, costlier, and encumbered with suspicion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 5: Create intense loyalty with all stakeholders:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Loyal workers and loyal customers are worth gold. Mission Essential: Building a Winning Culture in Government will help government leaders create lasting change in their organizations ? build a culture of passion and excellence, serve the public interest, provide satisfaction to team members, and create a better life for everyone involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
