      <meta name="description" content="Racism and substance-induced mood disorders are and have been in a uniformity of humankind since mankind has intermingled with each others culture, heritage, religion, and race. In this neurotechnical period, we have to understand the development of emotions, energies, and life forces in order to reshape and restructure ourselves. You see, we have been lied on and lied to as a human race. Therefore, we can only shape and change ourselves by freeing ourselves from addictions and negative behavioral patterns and emotions by admitting to ourselves that race, religion, and culture has been hidden from us within all social realms. Therefore, we must humble ourselves for we know nothing. We are in the image of the Creator." />
