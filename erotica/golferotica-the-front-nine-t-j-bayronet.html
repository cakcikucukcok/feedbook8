  <title>Golferotica: the Front Nine - T. J. Bayronet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Tom wondered whether he was crazy for believing that her smile seemed friendly and flirtatious. She was a very attractive woman, probably in her late 20&#39;s. He then began to wonder what she was doing on his golf course, alone, at this late hour of the day.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf is an extremely difficult game. But if you combine golf and sex, you can&#39;t go wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;GolfErotica-The Front Nine&lt;/I&gt; will take your mind off of the shanks, the four-putts, the triple bogies, and even the greenskeeper you knocked out with a wayward shot, and allow you to enjoy the game from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compilation of short stories-at times humorous, serious, erotic, and titillating-finds its foundation in the world of golf. With tales ranging from a chance fairway meeting between a course superintendent and a newly widowed woman, to the headline-grabbing, dying request of a lifelong golfer to his playing partner wife, &lt;i&gt;GolfErotica&lt;/i&gt; details the finer points of this popular game and also manages to spice up the fairways and greens with erotic energy.    Let your mind wander and enjoy &lt;I&gt;GolfErotica&lt;/I&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
