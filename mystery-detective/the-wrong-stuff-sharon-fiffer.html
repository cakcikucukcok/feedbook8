  <title>The Wrong Stuff - Sharon Fiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jane Wheel has a lot of stuff. Vintage flowerpots, postcards, Bakelite buttons, pencil sharpeners, mismatched china, linens, even old report cards from children she never knew peek out from the deepest corners of her home, threatening to envelop her entire life. Of course, she&#39;s not just a pack rat (or so she tells herself), it&#39;s her job: Jane is an antique picker, cruising garage sales and rummage tables looking for items she can turn around and sell to dealers or collectors, picking up a tidy profit. Trouble is, she does a lot of buying and so far only a little selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a school permission slip lost among the towering boxes in Jane&#39;s kitchen causes her son, Nick, to miss a field trip, Jane vows to get rid of it all, organizing her house and, in the process, she hopes, her life. Meanwhile, she&#39;s entertaining two offers of employment---as an associate with her friend Tim Lowry&#39;s antiques dealership and as a consultant in a private investigations firm with former police detective Bruce Oh. Unable to decide, Jane figures she&#39;ll take a crack at splitting her time between the two pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, and with fragile emotions swirling from her great house-cleaning project, Jane finds herself smack in the middle of a case that will draw on both her new jobs. An antiques dealer has been accused of murder, perhaps as part of covering up an extensive furniture-counterfeiting operation. Jane can hardly wait to investigate---that is, until she learns the identity of the accused: Claire Oh, wife of her new partner Bruce. Rich in the details of junk-sale ephemera that have intrigued fans of previous Jane Wheel adventures, &lt;i&gt;The Wrong Stuff&lt;/i&gt; is another fascinating, meticulously crafted mystery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
