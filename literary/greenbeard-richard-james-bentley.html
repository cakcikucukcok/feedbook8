  <title>Greenbeard - Richard James Bentley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Captain Sylvestre de Greybagges is your typical seventeenth-century Cambridge-educated lawyer turned Caribbean pirate, as comfortable debating the virtues of William Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, and compound interest as he is wielding a cutlass, needling archrival Henry Morgan, and parsing rum-soaked gossip for his next target. When a pepper monger&#39;s loose tongue lets out a rumor about a fleet loaded with silver, the Captain sets sail only to find himself in a close encounter of a very different kind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After escaping with his sanity barely intact and his beard transformed an alarming bright green, Greybagges rallies &lt;I&gt;The Ark de Triomphe&lt;/I&gt; crew for a revenge-fueled adventure to the ends of the earth and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Destined to become a cult favorite, this frolicsome tale of skullduggery, jiggery-pokery, and chicanery upon Ye High Seas is brimming with hilarious puns, masterful historical allusions, and nonstop literary hijinks. Including sly references to Thomas Pynchon, &lt;I&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/I&gt;, 1940s cinema, and notable historical figures, this m&amp;#233;lange of delights will captivate readers with its rollicking adventure, rich descriptions of food and fashion, and learned asides into scientific, philosophical, and colonial history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Richard James Bentley&lt;/B&gt;, who happens to look the part of a salty English sea captain, has trodden many paths and worn many hats. From his early work as a dealer in dodgy motorcars, he progressed to being a design engineer on a zeppelin project. Computers then caught his attention and he authored a number of incomprehensible technical manuals before turning to fiction. He has lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands and now spins yarns in the north of England. &lt;I&gt;Greenbeard&lt;/I&gt; is his first novel.&lt;/div&gt;" />
