  <title>The Angel Safe in Your Heart - Annie Hopkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This guide offers messages of love, hope and healing for the bereaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angel Safe in Your Heart seeks to make the loss and shock of bereavement more bearable. This book is written with love for all adults and older children who are grieving after the death of a loved one. It is written for people of all faiths and for people without religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing is encouraged in The Angel Safe in Your Heart through the reliability of love and the beauty that is all around us in Nature. This is done by exploring feelings of love and loss through sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, relationships, and memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angel Safe in Your Heart has been a short time in the writing and a lifetime in the making. It provides commonalities that anybody experiencing the pain of loss will be able to identify with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publication of The Angel Safe in Your Heart has been inspired by the courage and quiet dignity of people all over the world who have loved and lost, often under tragic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope it will help you find some comfort after the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief is a hollowing, humbling journey. The comforting reminder of our subtle connections to each other, coupled with its pure, magical imagery, makes this book a soft blanket to wrap around any aching heart. &lt;br /&gt;Lucinda Drayton, writer and singer of A Hundred Thousand Angels.&lt;/p&gt;
