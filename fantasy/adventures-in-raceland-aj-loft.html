  <title>Adventures in Raceland - Aj Loft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adventures in Raceland
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
One of the things Keegan and Kyle McKay like best about their
town is that it&#39;s home to the world famous Sunnyvale International Speedway where the world&#39;s best race car drivers come to race the coolest cars ever made!
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
In fact right now, two blazing fast race cars are coming around the last turn and heading straight at the McKay boys at over 200 mph! These racers are locked in an epic seesaw battle for the worldwide championship. They&#39;re both running flat out and are screaming toward the finish line. It&#39;s going to go right down to the wire!
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The McKay boys really love cars, especially racecars, and they
dream of racing someday. The one day, while they were messing
around in the hallway at Hot Rod High. Keegan bumped into a wall in just the right place, and a door they didn&#39;t even know was there swung slowly open and everything changed...
