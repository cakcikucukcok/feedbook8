  <title>The Political Problem of Religious Pluralism: And Why Philosophers Can&#39;t Solve It - Thaddeus J. Kozinski, Schall, Sj, James V.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book examines three notable philosophers&#39; attempts to solve the political problem of religious pluralism: John Rawls, Jacques Maritain, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Although many philosophers have grappled with this problem, what has not been sufficiently explored is the reciprocal relationship of foundational belief to political theory and political theory to political practice. Kozinski, using thorough research and a high level of philosophical discourse, deals with these issues directly and astutely demonstrates how any solution that does not incorporate both political philosophy and political theology is doomed to fail." />
