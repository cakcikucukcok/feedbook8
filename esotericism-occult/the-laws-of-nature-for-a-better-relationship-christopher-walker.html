  <title>The Laws of Nature for a Better Relationship - Christopher Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s totally refreshing to find a book written by a bloke for blokes about blokes in love. This book is well overdue and women all over the world should be celebrating. At last a bloke talking about &quot;evolve-ya-bastard&quot; to men. What is great is the question and answer format. So, it&#39;s relevant and contextual. I mean he&#39;s taken questions from people and answered them in as short a space of page as could be imagined. I don&#39;t think he could have said less, but in this case, less is more. The chapter about &quot;understanding others&quot; is awesome too. Who would have thought that thousands of years ago people knew so much about the human constitution and how &quot;different folks need different strokes&quot;  just from that alone, we can understand the dynamics between ourselves and others better and therefore, respect them more. The last chapter blew us away. Those two circles and the idea of being individual for more than 60% of our life yet, merging for 30% is sensational. It just makes being in love so much more fun. Partners all over the world will really laugh at this when they see how simple it can be. This is really life changing. As for the laws of nature: what genius. It is said that the most powerful teacher can make the most complex, simple. Brilliant understanding of the whole entire universe in five short laws, it&#39;s really unimaginable that it can be so ordered and perfect. So is this book.
