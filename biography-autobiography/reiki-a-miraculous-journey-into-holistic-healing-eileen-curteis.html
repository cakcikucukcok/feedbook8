  <title>Reiki: A Miraculous Journey into Holistic Healing - Eileen Curteis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reiki: A Miraculous Journey into Holistic Healing&lt;/i&gt; takes the reader into an autobiographical journey of healing which anyone can embark on, and is especially meant for persons who have not been able to find answers for their health issues in traditional western medicine. The book addresses a complementary path of healing with a strong emphasis on Reiki but is totally inclusive of any other avenue that leads to wholeness and good health. This book addresses taking responsibility for our lives and becoming pioneers of our own healing. It addresses how physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual healing need to be integrated in order for a person to feel fully alive and whole. &lt;br&gt;The story is told by Sister Eileen Curteis and is about her forty year journey into healing, the insights and wisdom she has gained, as one of life&#39;s travellers in search of wholeness. The story is told through Eileen&#39;s prose, poetry and art.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Eileen Curteis, a Sister of Saint Ann, is a Reiki Master teacher and practitioner, who has treated and taught thousands of people over the last twenty-three years. After the closure of Queenswood Retreat and Spirituality Centre where she had worked for seventeen years, Eileen carried on the legacy of the former Queenswood by obtaining a fifteen year trademark for Queenswood School of Reiki. She then went on to establish, with the help of other dedicated women, Queenswood Holistic Healing and Spirituality Society. Preceding this, Sister Eileen was a teacher, principal and educator for twenty-seven years. Her greatest passion lies in her healing ministry and in the literary arts. She has authored eleven books to date and has become an accomplished poet, artist and writer, as well as being a producer of six CDs and three films. She lives in Victoria, BC." />
