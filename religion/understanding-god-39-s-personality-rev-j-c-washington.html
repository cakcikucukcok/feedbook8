  <title>Understanding God&#39;s Personality - Rev J. C. Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book, Gods Personality, is that  we all want to know what personality of God that is not like our personality. Our personality changes like the weather, but Gods personality does not; his personality is everlasting. With us, we have two kinds of personality. There are the loved kind and the unloved kind. In this book, I am going to talk about both sides. A mans personality versus Gods personality. Many of us ask the question, Why are so many things happening today, like murder, shooting, terrorist attacks, robbery, and things like kidnapping, and God is not doing anything about them?
I will talk about that as I go through this book. There are many things as humans that we need to know about God and his ways. As we go through chapter to chapter, detailing the study of the fruit of the Spirit, I will awaken your thought and understanding. You need to see and know him as he is. He is not like us. He gives us a chance to be like him, but we have to work at it, by being the people that he created us to be. This too, I will be explaining in this book. If you know how to act toward others and the way you treat them and the way you carry yourself in everyday life, God has given you some talents to work with.
This book Understanding Gods Personality will answer many questions that one may ask concerning the fallen state of man. If we had the personality of God, many of us would not fall along the way, not knowing which way is right.  Jesus said, I am the way the truth and the light. I would like to see everyone go in the right way, that straight and narrow pathway to heaven, and rejoice with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with the angel singing the highest praise to the Lamb of God.
In Isaiah 38:1920 (KJV), Hezekiah said, The Living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. The Lord was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.
This to let them know that God can do the same for them.
To love Godyou need much to serve him!" />
