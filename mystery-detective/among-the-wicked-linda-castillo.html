  <title>Among the Wicked - Linda Castillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chief of Police Kate Burkholder is called upon by the sheriff&#39;s department in rural, upstate New York to assist on a developing situation that involves a reclusive Amish settlement and the death of a young girl.  Unable to penetrate the wall of silence between the Amish and &quot;English&quot; communities, the sheriff asks Kate to travel to New York, pose as an Amish woman, and infiltrate the community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate&#39;s long time love interest, State Agent John Tomasetti, is dead set against her taking on such an unorthodox assignment, knowing she&#39;ll have limited communication - and even less in the way of backup.  But Kate can&#39;t turn her back, especially when the rumor mill boils with disturbing accounts of children in danger. She travels to New York where she&#39;s briefed and assumes her new identity as a lone widow seeking a new life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate infiltrates the community and goes deep under cover.   In the coming days, she unearths a world built on secrets, a series of shocking crimes, and herself, alone... trapped in a fight for her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
