  <title>The Vardo - Kimberly J. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death is so boring. At least that&#39;s how fifteen-year-old Callie finds being stuck &quot;in between,&quot; until the day she discovers someone has left a newborn baby in the old gypsy wagon (or &quot;vardo&quot; as it&#39;s also called) in Wailing Woods. Determined to save the child, she tracks down Laney, the girl who barely survived the same car wreck that took Callie&#39;s life three years earlier (and whose mother&#39;s recklessness caused the accident in the first place). A mysterious connection between the two girls allows Callie to lead Laney into the spooky forest to save the baby. Laney hopes the newborn will finally help her family heal, but when Callie&#39;s grieving parents end up with custody, emotional wounds are deepened. Callie pieces together the mystery connecting the baby, the fleeting psychic powers Laney has had since the accident, and the too-good-to-be-true new guy in town. Could there be a reason Callie hasn&#39;t moved on to whatever comes next? Could she be the only one capable of putting things right?" />
