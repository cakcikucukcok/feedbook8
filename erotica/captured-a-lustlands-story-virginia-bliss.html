  <title>Captured: A Lustlands Story - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cass thought she was safe, and that&amp;#39;s when she dropped her guard. Stupid. Now the three raiders have her just where they want her, tied up, ready to be sold at the nearest slave market.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the end, there&amp;#39;s no choice. She has just one thing to offer the hard, brutal men who have taken her prisoner. Her ripe young body.... They won&amp;#39;t be able to resist - but will she be able to survive?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only signs of previous civilizations were stone structures, like the farm house nestled in the valley before her. Holes cut in the outer wall must have been for windows, but the glass had long ago shattered. The doors of the structure were also long gone, along with the shutters. She had no idea who had built the place, but they had made the floors, walls and roof from some kind of stone and these were all that remained of a past life. Cass didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the people who had lived here or how they had lived, but this little house had become a haven for herself, Dixon and Karl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dixon had a way with words, and he called this shit-hole of a world the &amp;#39;Lustlands&amp;#39;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Everyone here is lusting after something,&amp;quot; he told her when she&amp;#39;s asked why. &amp;quot;Guns, food, water. Power. Sex. Whatever, it&amp;#39;s a greedy, lustful world that we live in, no doubt. That&amp;#39;s why I call it the Lustlands.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cass thought he was right, but she also wondered if had ever been different, even back in the old world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She eased the quad bike down the hill and parked near the opening for what they assumed had been the front door. Karl and Dixon were waiting for her to get back to them and the car with the spare parts they had stashed in this building. They had been on a supply raid, scouring the landscape for other stone buildings like this one and searching caves for troves of treasure. Getting all of their loot back here would take multiple trips on the quad and it was just plain ludicrous for them to try it on foot. So Dixon had decided that he and Karl would continue fiddling with the car while Cass came back here to fetch the engine parts and return to them." />
