  <title>Treason, Treachery &amp; Deceit - James D. Norvell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historians may have locked the box on the JFK assassination and the life of Lyndon Baines Johnson but in reading James Norvells riveting out of the box tale, you will shiver with nagging thoughts of intrigue and doubt. Norvells semi-fictitious story, bolstered with historical facts, is a spellbinding masterpiece. He has interacted with principal characters  particularly Madeleine Brown and Billie Sol Estes  and done so in a personal manner and over an extended period of time. The more you read, the more youll wonder, Could this have happened? Be careful  once you pick it up you wont put it down. Dynamite! John H. (Jack) Grubbs, Ph.D, Brigadier General (Ret.), U. S. Army, author of Dryline and Bad Intentions.
Jim Norvells unique approach to explaining the assassination of President Kennedy leads the reader into this complex and often difficult subject from a fresh direction.  I recommend this book primarily because it exposes even the experienced student of the subject to information with which he may not have been familiar, and to possible associations between competing theories about what happened in Dallas, that may indicate  many of them are not necessarily mutually exclusive after all.  Mr. Norvell does not pull any punches, and does not sugar-coat the assassination story in any way.  An engaging read.  Douglas P. Horne, formerly Chief Analyst for Military Records, Assassination Records Review Board, B.A. in History, Ohio State University, and author of Inside the Assassination Records Review Board, Vol. I-V.
My classmate from the Naval Academy, Jim Norvell, has put together a very shocking scenario that leads to a very different assassination event than the lone gunman, lone event, Oswald-did-it type answer. Instead he constructs a list of timed events with key power brokers in 1963 that provides a hard-core conspiratorial assassination plot. . . And if you are not entirely convinced these diverse power brokers can mesh and team to make the killing of a President possible, then go very slowly through the chapters that lay down the assassination time lines . . .Point by point, bullet by bullet, the historical novel unfolds. . . .But I assure you that it will not end with a lone event, a lone gunman.
Two additional assassinations follow with the shootings of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Norvell drives you back in time to the 60s to piece together for you an entirely different assassination than the one focused on Oswald and defended as such by the Warren Commission. This is a very good read for all and especially for those who to this day can remember where we were on November 22, 1963. Alexander J. Krekich, Vice Admiral, U. S. Navy (Retired); B.S. U.S. Naval Academy 1964, M.S.A. George Washington University, 1972; U.S. Army Command &amp; General Staff College, 1973; and Naval War College, 1978.
I extend personal thanks to Jim Norvell for his deep insights, for connections not uncovered anywhere else, and for bringing us nearer to the solution to the most horrific crime in American History, horrific for what it did to one man and his family, horrific for what it did to America, and horrific for the failure of the authorities to mete out justice. Barr McClellan, B.A., J.D., University of Texas, author of Blood, Money and Power, How LBJ Killed JFK, and former law partner with LBJs attorney, Ed Clark.
Jim Norvells historical novel is a truly remarkable study of a broad range of facts surrounding a single individual. What he has carefully developed is almost unthinkable to well-adjusted human beings. To my knowledge, this depiction has not been accomplished before in our time, and he should be commended for all the long years of effort that it required. I found that his identification of LBJ as a narcissist is quite well-founded. There is a long and well-established history of those traits among world leaders in every field, many in very public roles. Health care professionals have identified and articulated in textbooks different types of narcissism and their symptomatic traits, some of which are incredibly destructive and actually evil. Jims novel acutely and accurately displays the personification of pure evil in LBJ. I think he has written a serious best-seller which will lead readers to thoughtfully and carefully examine the traits and actions which our public figures display. Ray C. Witter, Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), B.S. U.S. Naval Academy, M.S., Engineering Accoustics, Naval Postgraduate School" />
