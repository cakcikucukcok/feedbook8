  <title>Altered - Elaina Gaeta, Mackenna Gaeta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sage Gaveston was your typical wall flower.  She had few close friends and plenty of bullies.  She had little excitement in her life - that was until Purrin Xavier walked into Math class.
Purrin was everything Sage wasn&#39;t, outgoing, popular and gorgeous.  He even had the attention of Beverly Miles, the hottest girl in school.  So why did he bother with Sage?
Sage began to notice strange things happening around the new guy.  Milk exploding, soup boiling, and failed food fights to name just a few. 
Purrin was a mystery that Sage was bent on figuring out.  But what if the mystery wasn&#39;t so much the new kid, but Sage herself?  What if Sage was the puzzle that needed to be solved?" />
