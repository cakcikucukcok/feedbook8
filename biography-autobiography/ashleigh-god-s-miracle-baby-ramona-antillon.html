  <title>Ashleigh: God’S Miracle Baby - Ramona Antillon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Ramona Antillon, Im a Christian woman and a mother of four whom at 23 weeks along in my pregnancy had to believe that everything that happens in life is meant for a reason. When doctors only gave my unborn baby 20% chance at life, the only thing I could do was place my trust in God! Sometimes we dont know why and we may never know why things happen but we just need to always trust God in everything. The unexpected birth of my daughter Ashleigh was the most difficult experience Ive ever had to face. I wrote this book with Gods help and I kept a journal about Ashleigh from beginning to end. I recorded details that happened while Ashleigh was in the hospital and I wrote them all down in the journal daily so that one day Ashleigh would always remember and never forget how special she is and how God healed her. It wasnt until 8 years later that the Lord impressed in my heart to share her story. I want Ashleighs story to help others who may face a difficult birth of a child or for those who are sick to know that God is their healer! Medicine alone wasnt enough to heal Ashleigh, it was by the healing hand of God that Ashleigh was healed and is now living a normal life! I know that we serve an awesome God and that He is our healer. As you read this book I pray that you will be blessed and you too will know that He is your healer; He is the God of all flesh and nothing is too hard for Him with God all things are possible!!!!" />
