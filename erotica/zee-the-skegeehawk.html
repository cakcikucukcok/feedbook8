  <title>Zee - The Skegeehawk!</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gerry Mellows, forty-three-year-old college professor, has an obsessive-compulsive sex addiction. Twenty-seven-year-old student coed, hottie, and vivacious and vibrant vixen Zee Breyer is his latest target. Zee willingly becomes Gerrys latest mistress-playmate.
Passionate sexual adventures and sinful, lust-laden episodes lead to deception, iniquitous conception, and extramarital mnage a-trois mayhem. Self-destruction; self-demise; creeping; scheming; illicit, steamy sexingyou name it. This one has it. The three Sssin, scandal, shame. The three Rsraunchy, risqu, real!
Pam, Gerrys high school sweetheart and wife of ten years plus, becomes the focal point victim of eroding, spiraling family values, spiritual demise, and dramatic, traumatic, shameless home wrecking! Marital infidelity sparks fly in this sordid, sensual saga.
Dom, Zees part-time live-in lover, is in the dark. Rho, Zees voluptuous, diva younger sister, plays a central role.
Complicated relationships, intricate situational circumstances, lead down a Pandora s Box pitfall, a hurtful rocky road of perdition, peril, and adventure.
Zee is a naughty narrative of emotional nuances, psychological undercurrents, and clever witticisms. Sex-kitten vixen Zee Breyer runs half-naked through Gerrys midlife crisis, libido menagerie of creeping, conniving  infidelity; sin; adultery; hot, wild freaky sex;  scandalous betrayal; and treachery.
Ninety percent nonfiction, ten percent fiction, or its reversal ten percent fiction, ninety percent nonfiction. It really doesnt matter for all names of the innocent have been changed to protect the guilty. This one has more page-turning twists than a runaway lust rollercoaster.
ZEE is a composite of various womeninterwoven, intimately known, passionately loved and hated at different relational intervalsin the midst of tangled liaisons.
From sand-filled Jacksonville, Florida, beaches to Alabamas Crimson Tide backwoods up the eastern seaboard to Brotherly Love Philadelphia, Zee races like a Kentucky Derby thoroughbred.
Rated M for mature, N for naughty, ES for explicit sex, and G for gripping." />
