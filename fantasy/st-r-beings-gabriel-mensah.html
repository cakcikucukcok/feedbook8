  <title>St*R Beings - Gabriel Mensah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anu Adajo is one of the thirteen humans that 
recieved strange powers from outer space 
that unlocks the brains 
full potential to increase brain power 
percentage passed the limits through 
meditation. The government named 
these thirteen humans S-Beings which 
stands for Star Beings. 
The government was ordered by unknown 
entities to hunt down the Star Beings and kill them. 
Ten years has passed since Anu and the twelve
other humans got their powers. 
Anu believed all S-Beings were dead until he met 
Xun Yogochi, an S-Being and was known 
as the greatest fighter in all of Asia. 
Xun is on a mission to unite the last remaining 
S-Beings to fight against the government. 
Anu and Xun happen to find the last S-Beings 
alive which are just two (Una Purette who is a training kickboxer and Opu Odywa who is a sumo wrestler) 
The four S-Beings eventually unite after conflictions with Opu (who also is an agent sent to kill Xun and capture Anu) 
The four S-Beings will begin their fight for 
freedom which leads them down the path to 
fight against entities far 
beyond their world." />
