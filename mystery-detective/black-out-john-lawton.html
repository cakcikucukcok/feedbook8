  <title>Black Out - John Lawton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;John Lawton&amp;#8217;s debut novel&amp;#151;first published by Viking in 1995, and now being reissued by Grove Press&amp;#151;is a stunning, war-time thriller that cements his place among the greatest crime writers of our era. The first of the Inspector Troy novels, &lt;i&gt;Black Out&lt;/i&gt; singularly captures the realities of wartime London, weaving them into a riveting drama that encapsulates the uncertainty of Europe at the dawn of the postwar era.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;London, 1944. While the Luftwaffe makes its final assault on the already battered British capital, Londoners rush through the streets, seeking underground shelter in the midst of the city&amp;#8217;s black out. When the panic subsides, other things begin to surface along with London&amp;#8217;s war-worn citizens. A severed arm is discovered by a group of children playing at an East End bomb site, and when Scotland Yard&amp;#8217;s Dective Sergeant Frederick Troy arrives at the scene, it becomes apparent that the dismembered body is not the work of a V-1 rocket. After Troy manages to link the severed arm to the disappearance of a refugee scientist form Nazi Germany, America&amp;#8217;s newest intelligence agency, the OSS, decides to get involved. The son of a titled Russian &amp;#233;migr&amp;#233;, Troy is forced to leave the London he knows and enter a corrupt world of bloody consequences, stateless refugees, and mysterious women as he unearths a chain of secrets leading straight to the Allied high command.&lt;/div&gt;" />
