  <title>Good Enough Is The New Perfect - Becky &amp; Hollee Gillespie &amp; Temple</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;This is Not a Book About Settling. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re the generation destined to Have It All—a great job, the perfect family, and the time to enjoy both.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But between the conference calls and soccer practices, do you feel like you’ve lost track of what really makes you happy? And are you finding out the hard way that you can’t do everything?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The truth is that you can have it all. The secret is creating an &quot;all&quot; that you love.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Join a growing new wave of mothers who are learning to let go of the little things and focus on what they really want out of their career, their family and their lives. Through their ground-breaking research, Becky Beaupre Gillespie and Hollee Schwartz Temple have discovered a paradigm shift in motherhood today: more and more mothers are losing their Never Enough attitude and embracing a Good Enough mind-set to be happier, more confident and more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Filled with inspiring first-hand accounts from Good Enough mothers and drawn from the latest research, Good Enough is the New Perfect is a true roadmap for the incredible balancing act we call motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Discover the New Perfect for yourself—and see just how fulfilling modern motherhood really can be.&lt;/p&gt;
