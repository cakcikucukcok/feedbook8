      <meta name="description" content="Breathing Books is a final year University of Cumbria project, that consists of a compilation of short, autobiographical stories, produced by real people, about their personal experiences.Every so often, we are presented with moments that set up camp within our souls forever. These stories are filled with these moments. You never truly know what you mean to someone or how you have influenced them, but these stories have been an opportunity for the authors to write about the people in their lives. The beauty of real stories from real people are that they are infinite, whilst I am writing this there are 7,380,479,070 people in the world, over seven billion people creating new stories every day! What an absolutely terrifying yet amazing thought. Each story is a bite sized journey!" />
