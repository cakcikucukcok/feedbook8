  <title>Companion 2 - Ginger R. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a womans life after she leaves Earth with an alien. Most of her story is told through the entries she makes in her journal. Her alien companion is estranged from his father, yet his love for his father is reflected in everything he does. When he finally accepts that he will no longer be with his father, he finds another father figure to fill the void. As the Earth woman and her companion live out their lives, she writes about portals, battleships, warlike species, battles fought, a sun going nova, and even seniors joining the military. 
During the course of her life, the woman has gone from mental patient to mind walker to wife to warrior. Through it all, her companions have been more alien than anything she could have imagined while on Earth. 
This is a story about the relationship between a truly alien man, an Earth woman, a sentient spaceship, and the love they have for one another. The people they meet along the way only add more substance to her journal entries." />
