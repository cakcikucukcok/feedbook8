  <title>Head in the Game - Brandon Sneed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An intriguing blend of science and sports that explores how some of the worlds greatest athletes are utilizing the last frontier of performance-enhancing technology&amp;#8212;the mental mapping and engineering of their own brains&amp;#8212;for peak performance, and what it means for the future of athleticism, sports, and the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt; showed how statistics were revolutionizing baseball. &lt;em&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/em&gt; revealed the role genetics play in sports. Now, &lt;em&gt;Head in the Game&lt;/em&gt; examines the next evolution: how mental engineering&amp;#8212;the manipulation of the cognitive processes of the brain&amp;#8212;can make gifted athletes even better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, technology&amp;#8212;from EEG (electroencephalogram) to fMRI (Functional magnetic resonance imaging) to video games, tablets, and personal data collection devices&amp;#8212;have been used with soldiers to understand their physical and mental functioning. Touching on brain functionality vital to sports&amp;#8212;both the &quot;hard&quot; (coordination, stimuli processing, functional memory, decision-making, load-processing) and the &quot;soft&quot; (emotion regulation, visualization, psychology, mindfulness)&amp;#8212;this tech is now being adopted by scores of championship franchises and top athletes&amp;#8212;including scrappy underdogs forced to innovate and elite players looking for an advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star NFL quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Tom Brady, the NBA&amp;#8217;s Kyle Korver, and Olympic volleyball champion Kerri Walsh are using mental engineering to up their game. It&amp;#8217;s not luck that has transformed the San Antonio Spurs into a formidable force&amp;#8212;it&amp;#8217;s science, Sneed demonstrates. As mental engineering becomes widespread&amp;#8212;taking athletes who are already freaks of nature and making them better&amp;#8212;the impact on the multi-billion dollar sports industry will be dramatic on players, managers, trainers, owners, and even fans. Interviewing athletes and coaches, visiting training camps and sports science firms, Brandon Sneed offers a firsthand, on-the-ground look at this exciting breakthrough that has the potential to transform to transform the game&amp;#8212;and all our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
