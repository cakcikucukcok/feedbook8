  <title>Right by Her Side (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Logan&#39;s Legacy, Book 17) - Christie Ridgway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The news that he was going to be a dad shocked the heck out of sexy executive Trent Crosby! Having had enough of deceptive women in his lifetime, he had his doubts about Rebecca Holley, the &quot;mother&quot; of his child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when the beautiful nurse who&#39;d accidentally received his sperm refused to negotiate a deal, Trent found himself proposing a marriage of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before long, the love-weary businessman was rushing home to be by Rebecca&#39;s side…and to hold her in his arms. Then tragedy struck and Trent knew just what it would take to make his life complete–Rebecca as his truly lawfully wedded wife. Before it was too late, he had to convince her that his days of doubting were over!&lt;/p&gt;
