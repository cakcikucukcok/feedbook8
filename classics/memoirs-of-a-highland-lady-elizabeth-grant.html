  <title>Memoirs of a Highland Lady - Elizabeth Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edited and introduced by Andrew Tod.  &#39;I was born on the 7th May 1797 of a Sunday evening at No. 5 N. side of Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, in my father&#39;s own lately built house and I am the eldest of five children he and my mother raised to maturity.&#39;  Thus opens one of the most famous set of memoirs ever written. Since its first bowdlerised edition in 1898, they have been consistently in print. This is the first ever complete text.  Written between 1845 and 1854 the memoirs were originally intended simply for Elizabeth&#39;s family, but these vivid and inimitable records of life in the early 19th century, and above all on the great Rothiemurchus estate, full of sharp observation and wit, form an unforgettable picture of her time. The story ends with the thirty-three-year-old Elizabeth finding her own future happiness in marriage to an Irish landowner, Colonel Smith of Baltiboys.  &#39;A masterpiece of historical and personal recall.&#39; Scotsman" />
