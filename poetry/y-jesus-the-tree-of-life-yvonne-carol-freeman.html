  <title>Y: Jesus the Tree of Life - Yvonne Carol Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y: Jesus The Tree Of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.&lt;/em&gt;  John 15:4, 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dedicate this book to God Almighty my Heavenly Father. All I am and will ever be is because of the love God has for me. God so loved the world that he sacrificed his only son Jesus the tree of life who gave his life. Can you imagine that? There is no greater love than that. Jesus being an obedient son surrendered to the will of God the Father. He was crucified tortured he suffered for the sins of mankind. Our souls are not that of our own we were bought with the blood of Jesus the sacrificial Lamb of God. His death gave us a second chance to get it right to live a righteous life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is our Tree of Life. Like the trees which generate oxygen and bear fruit  strong  sturdy roots anchored deep beneath the earth. A foundation so sure  secure where the birds build their nests amidst the leaves on the branches high above the ground. Build your life on a secure foundation that wont crumble when you fall apart. Build your house on a rock that rock is Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are like withering leaves that dry up once separated from the vines and branches torn from the trees. If not anchored in faith were tossed about blowing everywhere in the storms of life. Scattered are we for lack of knowledge forgetting who and what really matters. As the leaves from the trees dry up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blowing all over this earth Im reminded of just how short life can be if not for the love of Jesus who saved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the Tree of Life the source from which I breathe  grow  how I survive in this universe. I eat not an apple or orange for those are temporary substances that sustain the body but for a short time. I eat the word of God each time I read the Holy Bible. A food to be absorbed by the mind not the mouth, it sustains me for life for it is stored in my heart. Life and death is in the hands of Jesus Christ. Oh taste how sweet the Lord can be when you eat from the Tree of Life  you shall live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y: Jesus The Tree of Life is Yvonne C. Freemans fourth book co-written by the inspiration of God  motivated by His written word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. &lt;/em&gt; Proverbs 13:12&lt;/p&gt;" />
