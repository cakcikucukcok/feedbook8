  <title>Blindfolded Innocence (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Alessandra Torre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure what you have been told about me, but I’m not nearly as bad as they make me out to be.” His deliciously deep voice carried a little bit of ego. I’m sure you are exactly as bad as they make you out to be…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brad De Luca is used to getting whatever and whomever he wants. The premier divorce attorney in town, he is a forty-year-old playboy who’s bedded half the city—including his own clients. And when the newest intern at his firm poses a challenge, his seductive prowess goes into overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pre-law student Julia Campbell is fresh off a failed engagement and happy with her new independence. Even if she weren’t warned away from Brad at every turn, she’d know he was bad news. The last thing she needs is an older man who could destroy her job prospects, not to mention her innocence. But before she knows it, the incorrigible charmer has her under his spell. His deviant tastes plunge her deep into a forbidden world of sexual exploration…but her heart may not survive the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EXTENDED EDITION&lt;/p&gt;
