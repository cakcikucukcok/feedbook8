  <title>Love Me Love Me Not - Maureen Whiting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An interesting mix of poetry that presents topics about love, life, and the intricacy of being in a relationship is in the new book titled Love Me Love Not written by author Maureen Whiting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Writing and reading poems about love is a way to get in touch with ones inner feelings about the emotions of loving and being loved. It spans emotions from hate and despair to admiration and adulation. The poems offered in this book reflect that diversity. Poems about love are not only for lovers but speak to anyone who has experienced the desire to be loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Poems about love are one of the most difficult things for a poet to excel in but are also the most exciting and the most challenging to write. To analyze the beginning, and the finality of love, the author exposes to readers the illusions, pain and healing in her poems. This collection is written, with true emotion and humor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For readers who have suffered from a broken heart, they will certainly find a common lament in the poems presented in this book. Poetry that deals with the subject of love adds something into this world. It gives, and sometimes it can change the way readers see the world. It can be angry and potent, but all these poems, these moments in language, emanates from love itself.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After all, love is an emotion of strong affection and personal attachment. Throughout history, the world culture has defined love to be a mysterious, complex, difficult, and indefinable entity and the subject of poems and other literary works." />
