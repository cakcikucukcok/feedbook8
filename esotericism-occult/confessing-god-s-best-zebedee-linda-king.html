  <title>Confessing God’S Best - Zebedee, Linda King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all desire for our households and extended families to prosper and be in good health even as our souls prosper. Even so, we are aware of the tremendous pressure that families today are under. Satan (the adversary of the family) and secular culture have waged an all-out offensive against marriages and families, leaving households depleted or desolate.
Yet Gods Word is saturated with promises of blessings and protection for families who will dare to honor his Word by hearing it and hiding it in their hearts and observing, fulfilling, and performing his will in their daily lives. The best way to accomplish his will is for families to train themselves to think, speak, and confess the Word of God as found in the holy scriptures.
As believers, we should learn to incorporate Gods Word into every aspect of our livesespecially regarding the words we speak. This is because the Bible is not just a collection of words for life; it contains the very words of life. By reading this little book, you too can learn how to proclaim and pray Gods Word over your family and speak life to your household!" />
