  <title>Notoriously Dapper - Kelvin Davis</title>

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Life skills for the modern gentleman&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The modern gentleman:&lt;/b&gt; Being a true modern gentleman and a genuine class act is increasingly rare. It is also more important now than ever before. What worked for the Rat Pack and the Brat Pack won’t work for you and truth be told, it won’t work for anyone because that is old school. Manliness in the modern era is worth learning about and the dividends will pay off for a lifetime. Not only will you bring joy to all those around you, you’ll be happier, too. Once you master this, you’ll live the good life.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Manliness,  life skills, and building self esteem:&lt;/b&gt; No one in the world is better suited than Kelvin Davis, (we’re talking really nice suits, too) to provide the ultimate guide to being a modern gentleman. A fresh voice in style, attitude, manners and body confidence or body positive for men, Kelvin is a model and major Instagram influencer who has been featured in Glamour Magazine, Buzzfeed, Cosmopolitan and much more. Davis is also a leading light in the body confidence movement for men, offering empowerment and wisdom that contributes to building self esteem wisdom. In his words, “You can choose to be great; clothing has sizes but style does not.”
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Building body confidence:&lt;/b&gt; Wedding etiquette and all around This book is a treasury of information covering all the bases from how to date (Hint, pulling up and waiting for her in your car is wrong, you’re not freaking Uber!) to social skills to etiquette for all occasions, even including counsel on improving your character. Whether you are at a weekend wedding with your friends, courting a new lady, being a great colleague at work or becoming a dad, &lt;i&gt;Notoriously Dapper&lt;/i&gt; provides practical information and inspiration for the modern gentleman seeking to build body positive life skills. 
&lt;p&gt;
You&#39;ll learn the life skills every modern gentleman should know, including these secrets to eternal style and class:
     •   Tie your own damn tie
     •   Be the perfect wedding guest
