      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anxiety Breakthrough&lt;/i&gt; breaks you out from the walls of Anxiety State Prison. First, the author inspires you with her own compelling story of imprisoning anxiety and panic. She helps you understand how and why you both became incarcerated, and then gives you her plan for escape; tools and strategies that will nourish your mind, body and spirit. Now, a psychotherapist specializing in anxiety, the authors down to earth, personable and empowering style jumps out of the pages making you feel she is working directly with you. &lt;i&gt;Anxiety Breakthrough&lt;/i&gt; promotes a shift from a reactive, symptom-driven, disease approach to a proactive, practical, empowering, all natural approach and ensures that you wont return to your tiny cell anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is part of the human fabric and a capacity that insured that our distant ancestors survived and is useful in modern life protecting us from danger and guiding our decisions.  However, in modern times so much anxiety is without purpose and interferes with functioning and enjoyment of life.  The author has written a book that describes anxiety in language that is easily understandable and presents a holistic approach to managing anxiety.  This book could be of great benefit to the millions of people suffering from unneeded anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
