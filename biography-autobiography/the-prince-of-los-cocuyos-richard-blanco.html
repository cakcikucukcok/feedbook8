  <title>The Prince of los Cocuyos - Richard Blanco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A poignant, hilarious, and inspiring memoir from the first Latino and openly gay inaugural poet, which explores his coming-of-age as the child of Cuban immigrants and his attempts to understand his place in America while grappling with his burgeoning artistic and sexual identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Blanco&amp;#8217;s childhood and adolescence were experienced between two imaginary worlds: his parents&amp;#8217; nostalgic world of 1950s Cuba and his imagined America, the country he saw on reruns of &lt;em&gt;The Brady Bunch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Leave it to Beaver&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;an &amp;#8220;exotic&amp;#8221; life he yearned for as much as he yearned to see &amp;#8220;la patria.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating these worlds eventually led Blanco to question his cultural identity through words; in turn, his vision as a writer&amp;#8212;as an artist&amp;#8212;prompted the courage to accept himself as a gay man. In this moving, contemplative memoir, the 2013 inaugural poet traces his poignant, often hilarious, and quintessentially American coming-of-age and the people who influenced him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prismatic and lyrical narrative rich with the colors, sounds, smells, and textures of Miami, Richard Blanco&amp;#8217;s personal narrative is a resonant account of how he discovered his authentic self and ultimately, a deeper understanding of what it means to be American. His is a singular yet universal story that beautifully illuminates the experience of &amp;#8220;becoming;&amp;#8221; how we are shaped by experiences, memories, and our complex stories: the humor, love, yearning, and tenderness that define a life.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
