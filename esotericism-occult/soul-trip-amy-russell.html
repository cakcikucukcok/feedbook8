  <title>Soul Trip - Amy Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Soul Trip is a compilation of poetry and blogs, interwoven with story, about waking-up. Soul Trip is the first in a series of three books that document the intensity of emotion, thought, and questioning that occurs when the perception of life begins to drastically change. 
Soul Trip accounts deep extremes of sorrow and pain, and seeing such emotions as the true catalysts for living an authentic life that lead to finding ones Bliss. 
Soul Trip shares this experience through looking at love and heartbreak differently, finding who you are as you analyze who you were, and seeking fullness in the expression of ones heart. 
Soul Trip poetically illustrates the pain, rejection, disappointment, sorrow, and misunderstanding that leads to the love inside oneself so we can experience just who we are, in an unknown, yet whole, way. 
In awakening, letting go of what you really think love is, trusting whatever comes your way, and finding beauty in the intensity and sorrow of life because these are leading you to you, is the purpose of Soul Trip. 
Soul Trip takes you there in all that murky and ecstatic passion and depth. 
Soul Trip is waking-up." />
