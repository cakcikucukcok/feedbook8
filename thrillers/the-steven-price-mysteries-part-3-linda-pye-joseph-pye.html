  <title>The Steven Price Mysteries Part 3 - Linda Pye, Joseph Pye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the third novel based around the character of D.C.I Steven Price by Joseph and Linda Pye. It is the fourth book to be published in eighteen months by the couple who only met in 2008. Joseph has had the stories in his head for a long while and has even written them in the past although never got them published. Linda writes the female parts and edits the books and they work together well as a team. The first three books are now in the local library and are being well received by customers as they are often out on loan. The accompanying photo was taken in Queensland, Australia, where the couple spent five weeks visiting family, having a &#39;mock up&#39; wedding so that Joseph&#39;s sister Marilyn could be there as she couldn&#39;t make the real one later in the year, her husband Derek, is a marriage celebrant over there. We made many good friends during out time over there and miss them all lots as we do our family and friends that we don&#39;t see so often.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
