  <title>Simon Magus - Eric Berman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am Simon Magus the stitcher of past and future. I ply my trade where the tired, the old, the dispossessed of the world are wound on the great loom of Government. They come before me, their lives a tangled skein of memory. Mother and father, friends and loved ones have fallen by the way; the past has faded; the things that were left behind have moldered and are scattered. The mind of a son, a daughter sitting before me dims. The thread is lost. Oblivion.&quot; 
&lt;P&gt;So begins this extraordinary story of love and mystery, courage and despair set in the streets of New Orleans. Simon Magus is a bureaucrat, an expert in navigating the twists and turns of other peoples&#39; lives. But now, falling into the emotional hell of his own failed marriage, torn by dreams of his lost children, he reaches out to beauty and love to save himself, and he is drawn into a world he cannot control, into the slow motion agony of drugs: this is the world laid bare by Simon Magus. This is the world of his redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
