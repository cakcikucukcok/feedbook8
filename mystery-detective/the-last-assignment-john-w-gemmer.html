  <title>The Last Assignment - John W. Gemmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jim Bartlett is a very reliable and unique professional killer for hire in the U.S. His clientele consist of mob bosses, who employ him to kill criminals, businessmen and politicians. During the Vietnam War, Bartlett was told by his commanding officer that he was &quot;either a natural-born killer or natural-born soldier.&quot; His experience with killing led him to his career. &lt;br&gt;After 29 years, Bartlett was feeling a change within himself because of his desire to be safe and secure with the woman he loved. Soon he decides to retire and on his own terms. He realizes his biggest challenge might not be the next assignment but how to retire on a tropical island with her. The problem is most hit men don&#39;t retire; they either go to jail or get killed. &lt;br&gt;When a mob attorney contacts him for an assignment, Bartlett realizes this will be his last. At first, it appears to be a simple hit, until a series of unexpected events make it his most difficult yet. The story culminates with a series of surprise endings for many of the main characters who find themselves either dead, under indictment with their careers ruined or safe and secure.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;John W. Gemmer resides in Syracuse and is a native resident of Indiana. For nine years, John was fortunate enough to spend part of his retirement years in Naples and Orlando, Florida. He is an Indiana University graduate and was a member of the U.S. Naval forces from 1968-1972. He served on the USS Harold J. Ellison DD 864 and worked for SACLANT, a NATO command. John spent the majority of his professional years as publisher of The Goshen (IN) News, a daily community newspaper. Gemmer had a kidney transplant on Dec. 28, 2010. In his spare time, he enjoys boating and jet skiing with family and friends, target shooting as well as reading and watching crime and drama movies. John is an avid Notre Dame, NFL and NBA fan. He has one daughter and is a proud grandfather of four." />
