  <title>Bless This House - Donna Henes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this comprehensive guide to crafting your own spiritual intentions, rituals, and blessings, urban shaman Mama Donna draws upon a variety of world cultures to show how to transform your environment into a sanctified haven. Spiritual blessings of our surroundings can help enhance our daily lives, from processing emotions and releasing negative energy to setting the stage for our fondest dreams to come true.&lt;BR&gt;Your immediate&amp;nbsp;surroundings&amp;nbsp;are the psychic as well as&amp;nbsp;physical spaces that you occupy in the world &amp;#8212; they house not just your body but your energy, your thoughts, your demeanor, your spirit, your deeds, and your legacy. Shouldn&#39;t the energetic atmosphere within your walls support you emotionally and spiritually as well? A personalized blessing ceremony engenders an aura of hope and the possibility of positive new beginnings, creating a safe milieu conducive to regeneration. Times of celebration and transition &amp;#8212; receiving dinner guests, hosting a family get-together, traveling to a new locale, moving offices or homes &amp;#8212; also deserve to be sanctified. This book is your guide to creating a warm home&amp;nbsp;and blessing your space for any occasion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;The way an architect and a builder understand a house, Donna Henes understands a home. She can minister to a dwelling like a chaplain, tap its inner workings like a good therapist, and polish its energy to a spotless shine. I know: she&#39;s done it for mine. And in this enchanting book, you get to access the prowess of Mama Donna in your home, even if oceans separate you from her legendary Brooklyn digs. What she knows &amp;#8212; and what she senses &amp;#8212; inhabit these pages so accessibly, it&#39;s as if this shaman of spaces is whispering in your ear.&quot; &amp;#8212; Victoria Moran, author of &lt;I&gt;Creating a Charmed Life &lt;/I&gt;and &lt;I&gt;Shelter for the Spirit&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Get out your highlighter! Mama Donna&#39;s book &lt;I&gt;Bless this House&lt;/I&gt; is immensely readable, practical, and filled with modern and ancient wisdom. After using her methods, your home will shimmer and sparkle with healing, radiant energy.
