  <title>Stone Cold Con - Bill Pether</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Master con artist Max Stone and his crew are doing the classic &amp;#39;Bait and Hook&amp;#39; con on Joseph Perkins. The beautiful Jamie Paige lures Joseph to Max. Everything goes smoothly until the very end when Jamie is nowhere to be found. Leaving Max to improvise to complete the big payday. The big question is where is Jamie? It turns out she has been arrested and charged with the murder of her fiance, Robert. Max with the rest of the crew, Simon and Mike, they start to look into the car bombing that killed Robert, that they knew Jamie didn&amp;#39;t commit. With Jamie&amp;#39;s face plastered all over the news, Joseph realizes that he had been conned out of 420k. Joseph is the first to visit Jamie in jail after her bail was denied. Jamie is still known as her alias Jessica to the police and Joseph. Joseph having pull got her bailed denied. Joseph doesn&amp;#39;t care about if she did it or not. He cares about getting his money back and for Jamie to turn the crew over to him or he will make sure she spends the rest of her life in jail. Once Max determines what Joseph said was true, he calls him to see what he wants with them. Besides wanting his money back, he wants them to do a job for them. For them to get Jamie out of jail they have to provide Joseph proof of who killed Robert and to hurt his enemy by taking his money, both have to be completed before the trial starts in three weeks. With a tight deadline, they bring in another computer hacker named Tank. With the proof of who and why did the murder/frame job. They move in on Randal Fredrick&amp;#39;s. Their little caper lands them in the Cayman Islands, kidnapping Randal. They think they are in the clear but then find themselves with no money and no Randal. They quickly put together a new plan, which gets them the money and where Max it almost killed. With Jamie out of jail, vengeance for Roberts murder was the only thing on her mind. Jamie is now staying with Max. Life as a con man Max has always been alone, jumping from place to place. No relationships just one-night stands. Settling down in a relationship has been creeping into his mind more and more lately. Scotch was his way to numb the pain. With Jamie at his place, there were feelings he had never imagined. It was so good. He doesn&amp;#39;t want it to leave. With the bomber dying while being chased by the police, it just left the person who gave the order. Alphonso the mob boss wanna be. With the discovery of Alphonso&amp;#39;s secret life, they used that and subliminal messages to take care of Alphonso without getting their hands dirty. Max was dreading this day when it would be all over because Jamie would go off on her own. Max tells Jamie he is going to travel and he asks her to join him. Holding his breath saying to himself, Please, please say yes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
