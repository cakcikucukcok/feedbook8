  <title>What You Need to Know to Go Global - Stephen Creskoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What You Need To Know To Go Global&lt;/em&gt; is a terrific book! Any SME wanting to compete in world markets should read &lt;em&gt;What You Need To Know To Go Global&lt;/em&gt; written by an extremely knowledgeable expert with a lifetime of hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;--William Krist, Senior Scholar, Wilson Center and author of &lt;em&gt;Globalization and Americas Trade Agreements&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a practitioner of international trade law for 30 years, I am often asked for help with this very question - how do I go international with my business? Until now, Ive never had a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Creskoffs book fills a big gap in the available books on this subject. It is very practical and the stories based on his work and experience place the issues in context and allow the reader to understand the how and why not just the what. Chapter 9 alone is worth the price of the entire book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value provided in this book is worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars in consulting fees. The reader gets the benefit of the authors years of global experience for the price of the book, a real bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Jeff Snyder, General editor, Global Trade &amp; Custom Journal and Chair, international trade group, Crowell &amp; Moring LLP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What You Need To Know To Go Global&lt;/em&gt; is an invaluable tool for anyone trying to understand and overcome the challenges of international trade. It is highly readable and full of insights and practical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
