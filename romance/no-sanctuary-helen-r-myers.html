  <title>NO SANCTUARY - Helen R. Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Metal sculptor Bay Butler spent six years in a Texas prison for a crime she did not commit&amp;#151;until the efforts of a powerful client get her conviction overturned. Suddenly Bay is free, but she is still plagued with questions. Why was she imprisoned based on circumstantial evidence? And what really happened the night her business partner was found brutally murdered in their studio?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her quest for the truth brings her face-to-face with Jack Burke, the cop who arrested her for the murder. Bay Butler&amp;#39;s case has haunted him for six years&amp;#151;and so has the woman herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Bay feels she owes benefactress Madeleine Ridgeway her life, she is unsettled by the woman&amp;#39;s fierce attention. Since she is the powerful head of a large ministry, her patronage of Bay should be welcome. Instead, it puts Bay and Jack on a trail of deadly secrets that threaten the foundation of a small Texas town&amp;#133;a town where power and money have exacted a price in blood." />
