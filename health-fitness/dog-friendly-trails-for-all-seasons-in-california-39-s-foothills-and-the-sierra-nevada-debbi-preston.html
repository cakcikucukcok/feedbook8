  <title>Dog-Friendly Trails for All Seasons in California&#39;s Foothills and the Sierra Nevada - Debbi Preston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		This book is a follow-up to 48 Dog-Friendly Trails in Californias Foothills and the Sierra Nevada, published by AuthorHouse in 2008. In keeping
		with the first books structure, there are four trailheads described for each month of the year to encourage year-round outdoor excursions. In
		some cases, there are multiple trail choices from a single trailhead so everyone can find an outing suitable to their groups individual needs.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;br/&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Trails are all dog friendly, with some providing off-leash opportunities. Many of the trails are also suitable for joggers, mountain bikers, and
		equestrians. A table at the back of the book identifies the usage for each trail. You will also find information as to which trails feature great
		views, swimming, family access, fishing, and other activities.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;br/&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Listening to readers feedback from the first book, with the new book the focus is in finding more obscure trails so even the most experienced
		enthusiast will find new places to explore. There are also maps for trails with difficult descriptions. Trails are still rated from 1
		(easiest) to 5 (most difficult), but with this book you will find more trails with a 4 and 5 rating. Still
		there are easy options for each month, but overall there are more challenging opportunities.
	&lt;/p&gt;
