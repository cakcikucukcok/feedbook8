  <title>The Valley - M. W. Kohler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For any that think that life in a magical world is all joy and wonder, come find the truth for yourself. It is work. It is need. It can also be dangerous! This is the first book of the, &lt;I&gt;The Valley series&lt;/I&gt;. This book will create the foundation for the characters that make up the future of Rightful Magic, as well as give you the purpose and value of those who hold rightful magic as a truth. You will also find those who are of the basis for Dark Magic, and their terrible goals.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;What are the races of a Magical Valley to do against a beast so driven by the unbelieving outer world, that it must destroy all those of the Valley, and Rightful Magic? They must find Michael, who is of that outside world and can see not just the difference of the worlds, but can also see the value of both. Michael must then fight the battle that the Valley folk cannot, for they do not understand how their world can be hated, or feared. He seeks to destroy the beast that cannot be named and while doing this, he saves the woman who becomes his wife and is as intent on the rightfulness of the Valley, as he is.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Their children become not just a part of the Valley, but unknowingly, become the beginning of the power of the Rightful Magic. Cory, the first born, becomes the power that drives the true value of magic, to awareness. DeeDee, his younger sister, gives value to her brother and the Valley. Tom and Sandy, who become Corys wife and DeeDees husband, giving  support to them as no others from the outer world could.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Come find the truth of a magical Valley and a magical Plain, and all those who are a part of them. Come find what is to be the beginning of the future, for all the magical worlds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
