  <title>Leo Geo and His Miraculous Journey Through the Center of the Earth - Jon Chad, Jon Chad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An intrepid explorer climbs down, down, down the page as he voyages through the center of the earth in this unusually inventive comic adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrepid explorer Leo Geo is heading off on a mission into the unknown. With science as his sidekick, he intends to tunnel his way to the center of the earth. Of course, things never turn out quite the way you expect when you&#39;re burrowing your way through the earth&#39;s layers. Before long, Leo is forced to leave his tunneling machine behind, and  he climbs, crawls, and falls to his destination while dodging giant centipedes, man-eating quadclops, and an evil army of subterranean malvisors bent on invading the surface. Kids will be drawn in by the unusual format of this inventive comic, following Leo as he climbs deeper  and deeper into a very long and skinny book--and they may just learn a few things about geology as they go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
