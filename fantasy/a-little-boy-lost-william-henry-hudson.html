  <title>A Little Boy Lost - William Henry Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A Little Boy Lost&quot; is a 1905 novel by W. H. Hudson. It is the charming tale of Martin, a young boy who walks a bit further from his house every day each day until he reaches mystical land full of talkative animals, friendly gnomes, and mist people. William Henry Hudson (1841 - 1922) was an Anglo-Argentine naturalist, author, and ornithologist. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is best known for his novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904). Other notable works include &quot;A Little Boy Lost&quot; (1905) and &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918), which has since been adapted into a film. Hudson is considered a national treasure in Argentina, and his legacy lives on in the form of an Italian town and numerous other public places named after him. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
