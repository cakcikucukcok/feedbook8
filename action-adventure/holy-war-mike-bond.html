  <title>Holy War - Mike Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Battle of Beirut is worse than Hell, a maelstrom of implacable hatreds and frantic love affairs, of explosions, sniper battles and deadly ambushes. Neill, a journalist on a secret mission for Britain&#39;s MI6 intelligence agency, is trying to find Mohammed, a Hezbollah terrorist who could stop the slaughter.  André, a French commando, is also hunting Mohammed, to kill him for the death of his brother, blown up with over 400 US Marines and French paratroopers by Hezbollah. For Rosa, a remorseless and passionate Palestinian guerrilla, Mohammed is one of few hopes for her people, and she will die to protect him.  And for lovely Anne-Marie, André is the only one who can save her from Hell. Based on the author&#39;s own experiences in Lebanon, Syria and the Middle East, Holy War has been praised for its portrayal of civil war, and for its evocation of men and women caught in a deadly crossfire." />
