&lt;strong&gt;Dale Carnegie&lt;/strong&gt; (1888&amp;ndash;1955) was an American writer and lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking and interpersonal skills.&lt;br /&gt;
He was born in an impoverished family in Maryville, Missouri. Carnegie harbored a strong love and passion for public speaking from a very early age and was very proactive in debate in high school. He went to the Warrensburg State Teachers College and later onwards became a salesman for Armour and Company in Nebraska. He also moved to New York in the pursuit of a career in acting and gave classes in public speaking at the Young Men&amp;#39;s Christian Association.&lt;br /&gt;
During the early 1930&amp;#39;s, he was renowned and very famous for his books and a radio program. When &amp;#39;How to Win Friends and Influence People&amp;#39; was published in 1930. It became an instant success and subsequently became one of the biggest bestsellers of all time. It sold more than 10 million copies in many different languages. He also began work as a newspaper columnist and formed the Dave Carnegie Institute for Effective Speaking and Human Relations, with several branches globally.&lt;br /&gt;
Carnegie loved teaching others to climb the pillars of success. His valuable and tested advice was used in many domains and has been the inspiration of many famous people&amp;#39;s success. One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people&amp;#39;s behavior by changing one&amp;rsquo;s reaction to them. The most famous and cited maxims in the book are &amp;quot;Believe that you will succeed, and you will,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Learn to love, respect and enjoy other people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
