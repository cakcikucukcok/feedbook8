          &lt;strong&gt;Playing the part of Gillian Ridgeway&#39;s tourist husband might be OMEGA operative Mike Callahan&#39;s toughest assignment yet.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keeping his hands off the too-young, too-innocent, stunning novice field agent while they were supposed to act all lovey-dovey? Right. He&#39;d have to rely on all his torture training and focus on their mission: to track down the source of a potentially deadly virus in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When their job was complicated by pint-sized scam artists who wiggled their way into Mike&#39;s heart, Gillian knew her undercover husband wasn&#39;t as jaded as he claimed. But to turn their cover into a real-life arrangement, first they&#39;d have to come home alive.&lt;/p&gt;
