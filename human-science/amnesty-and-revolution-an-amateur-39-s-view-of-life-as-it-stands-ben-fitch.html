  <title>Amnesty and Revolution: An Amateur&#39;s View of Life As It Stands - Ben Fitch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through engagement with human behaviour from the level of the private individual to the international community, in Amnesty and Revolution: An Amateur&amp;#39;s View of Life As It Stands a holistic type of reform is advocated; solutions to scarcity and inequity are formulated with due regard to the cost of revoking commitments already in motion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author&amp;#39;s rationale is to provide a counterbalance wherever excess or paucity is perceived, and by applying a moderate degree of erudition and scientific understanding to the exercise of drawing inferences and forging creative associations, the book&amp;#39;s themes are addressed intellectually and intuitively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Amnesty and Revolution the author specifically addresses domestic economic and social policy, social work, mental health, health problems associated with modern technology, renewable and non-renewable energy, environmental policy, globalisation, international conflicts and internal security. The author consistently targets systems rather than specific actors, in order to appease those who despite their culpability possess skills and experience which may be useful in effecting peaceable reform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In several places within the text there are extensive descriptions which serve as expedient points of access to the text&amp;#39;s central arguments. Since these descriptions serve as introductions to topics which are related to academic specialisms, although hitherto they may not have been recognised as such, this book would be of great value to academics. Indeed, industrial specialisation and the manner in which this can prevent the context of a specialism being understood by its practitioners is a theme which is explored within the text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While some explanations would be understood more easily with foreknowledge of certain scientific principles, the central arguments of the text are accessible without scientific explanations needing to be fully understood. Accordingly the book is suitable for a general audience, and especially anyone with an interest in progressive politics, addressing as it does a range of contentious issues." />
