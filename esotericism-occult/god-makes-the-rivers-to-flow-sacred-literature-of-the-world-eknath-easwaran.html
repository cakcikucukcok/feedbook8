  <title>God Makes the Rivers To Flow: Sacred Literature of the World - Eknath Easwaran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Respected teacher and author Eknath Easwaran drew deep, ongoing inspiration from the sacred literature of all traditions. These 149 selections represent his choice of the most life-affirming and lyrical writings, from the great river of wisdom that is always flowing &amp;#150; down the centuries and throughout the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;The short extracts in this anthology come from the much-loved saints, sages, and scriptures of the Christian, Hindu, Sufi, Jewish, Native American, Buddhist, and Taoist traditions, and include a number of Easwaran&amp;#8217;s own translations from his best-selling Classics of India series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These passages can be read for daily inspiration, for the insights they give into other spiritual traditions, for the light they throw on how to live, for the sustenance they offer when we feel sad or tired, and for the deep transformation they can bring in Easwaran&amp;#8217;s method of passage meditation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rich supporting material includes an introduction from Easwaran and an essay on the message of the scriptures, with stories from India, detailed background notes for all the texts, tips for making them part of a daily reading routine and for memorization, suggestions for using them for close study in practices such as lectio divina from the Christian tradition, and instruction in Easwaran&amp;#8217;s program of passage meditation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Uplifting and lyrical, sometimes startlingly practical, these passages all express the same underlying, unifying truth &amp;#150; that we are essentially spiritual beings, with resources of love, energy, and wisdom, intended to make our contribution to our communities and our world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book to treasure, to come back to countless times. With every encounter, these passages reveal a deeper meaning. Just reading them can inspire us and point us in the right direction; meditating on them, in Easwaran&amp;#8217;s method of passage meditation, brings their wisdom to life. As Easwaran writes, &amp;#147;If this appeals to you, everything you need to start is here.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;" />
