  <title>This Side of Brightness - Colum Mccann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Songdogs&lt;/i&gt;, a magnificent work of imagination and history set in the tunnels of New York City.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the century, Nathan Walker leaves his native Georgia for New York City and the most dangerous job in America. A sandhog, he burrows beneath the East River, digging the tunnel that will carry trains from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Above ground, the sandhogs--black, white, Irish, Italian--keep their distance from each other until a spectacular accident welds a bond between Walker and his fellow diggers--a bond that will bless and curse the next three generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, Treefrog, a homeless man driven below by a shameful secret, endures a punishing winter in his subway nest. In tones ranging from bleak to disturbingly funny, Treefrog recounts his strategies of survival--killing rats, scavenging for discarded soda cans, washing in the snow. Between Nathan Walker and Treefrog stretch seventy years of ill-fated loves and unintended crimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a triumph of plotting, the two stories fuse to form a tale of family, race, and redemption that is as bold and fabulous as New York City itself. In &lt;i&gt;This Side of Brightness&lt;/i&gt;, Colum McCann confirms his place in the front ranks of modern writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
