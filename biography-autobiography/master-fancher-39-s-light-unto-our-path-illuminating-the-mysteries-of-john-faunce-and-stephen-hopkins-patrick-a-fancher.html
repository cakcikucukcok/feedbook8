  <title>Master Fancher&#39;s Light Unto Our Path - Illuminating the Mysteries of John Faunce and Stephen Hopkins - Patrick A. Fancher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Master Fancher&#39;s Light unto Our Path, is a story of tragedy and triumph, as a young English lad faces his father&#39;s death at the tender age of six. Unable to provide for himself, he spends time in houses of refuge until signing as servant to a master in the Colony of Virginia. Upon working out his servitude, the young man returns to England where through an apprenticeship with the Merchant Taylor&#39;s he learns the craft of weaving, before returning to Virginia as a landowner. After brief triumphs, tragedies continue as William and his wife sell their land in Virginia, and go meandering through New England. There they resort to a transient lifestyle highlighted by years of hardships and humiliations. &quot;Wm Fancy owned it as his sin his oft drinking...&quot; William&#39;s lack of vision toward success, possibly magnified by his lifelong trend of non-channeled self-sufficiency plus his drinking, could have led to Katherine&#39;s humiliating propositions as she worked as a handmaid." />
