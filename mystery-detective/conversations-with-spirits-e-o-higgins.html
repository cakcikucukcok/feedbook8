  <title>Conversations with Spirits - E. O. Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;December, 1917. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great War is rampaging through Europe - yet Trelawney Hart has scarcely noticed. The arch-sceptic and former child prodigy has lost his way and now ekes out a lonely existence, taking his only comfort from the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dissolute lifestyle is interrupted, however, when spiritualist crusader and celebrated author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle arrives at the door of his London club and requests his help in investigating a man he believes to be a psychic medium of unparalleled gift. Driven on by his anticipation of exposing the psychic as a fraud, Hart accepts. But it is not long before he finds himself helpless amidst a series of seemingly inexplicable events - and he is forced to consider whether there may be much more to life than he had ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nominated for the Edinburgh Book Festival&#39;s 2014 First Book Award.&lt;/p&gt;" />
