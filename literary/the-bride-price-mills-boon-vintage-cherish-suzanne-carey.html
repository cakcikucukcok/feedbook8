          &lt;strong&gt;IF HER WEDDING HAD BEEN A DREAM…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kyra Martin woke up convinced that she and Navajo heartthrob David Yazzie had just been married. She had vivid memories of the traditional ceremony–&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the anything-but-wedding night that followed. Yet just yesterday, she and her one-time true love had called it quits–this time, forever. This wedding couldn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have happened–could it?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THEN WHOSE CHILD WAS SHE CARRYING?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When her doctor told her that what she could expect in less than nine months was all too real, Kyra knew that even her overactive imagination couldn&#39;t account for her condition! &lt;em&gt;Had&lt;/em&gt; her dream lover become her husband? And was a crash course in parenthood on his horizon, as well?&lt;/p&gt;
