  <title>Back 2/1: I Invite You into My Serenity - Deborah Chenault Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the age of forty-eight, I thought my dreams were over. Depressed, physically ill and emotionally bruised, I had all but given up. I had no hope and felt destined to a life of misery and gloom. Then something happened, I began to hear a voice speak to me. Was I crazy? God doesn&#39;t speak to &quot;ordinary&quot; people, does he? Well, he was speaking to me. At first I didn&#39;t know what to think, what to do, but then He told me to look back over my life and tell Him what I saw. What I saw was not what I expected; what I saw was evidence of God&#39;s goodness throughout my life. That&#39;s when I began to thank and praise Him. From that day my life changed drastically, on every level, in every aspect. I began to look at life in a new way, a more positive way. The more positive I began to think, the more positive things started to occur in my life.  Those conversations with God led to the writing of this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
