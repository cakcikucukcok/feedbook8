  <title>Our Puppet Government (Updated &amp; Revised 2nd Edition) - John R. Krismer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Few realize a &lt;i&gt;New World Order (NWO)&lt;/i&gt; plans to replace our constitution with a &lt;i&gt;Single World Government&lt;/i&gt;; nor that our Federal Reserve Bank is privately owned and is not subject to oversight by our Congress or the President. Peter Kershaw, in his book &quot;Economic Solutions&quot; exposes this &lt;i&gt;NWO&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; controlling stockholders to include the Rockefellers, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers of New York; the Rothschilds of London and Berlin; the Lazard Brothers of Paris; Israel Seiff of Italy; the Kuhn &amp; Loeb Company of Germany; and the Warburgs of Hamburg and Amsterdam, who are earning almost two billion dollars a day in interest as they buy off our dysfunctional Congress and intentionally level this great nation to that of others. George H. W. Bush, the undisputed &quot;&lt;i&gt;Overlord&lt;/i&gt;&quot; of the &lt;i&gt;Shrub Dynasty&lt;/i&gt;, in his State of the Union Message of 1991 said: &quot;&lt;i&gt;What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea - a new world order.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Did &lt;i&gt;We the People&lt;/i&gt; ever agree to this treasonous act of turning over our nation&#39;s sovereignty to a &lt;i&gt;Single World Government&lt;/i&gt;? And today we have reached a point of no return, meaning that if we do not act now, we risk the loss of both our freedom and our Democracy.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;John R. Krismer, MHA-LFACHE is founder and CEO of Health Systems Institute, consulting with governments, hospitals, clinics, and professional organizations while serving as CEO of several hospitals and corporations, and as a board member for two health insurance companies. He has conducted hundreds of educational institutes, and served as a principle investigator, researching the health record database system with four major universities, which required a comprehensive universal non-profit single prepayment system to provide cost effective high quality care that was to be lead by healthcare professionals, not plutocrats. He has been referred to as a visionary ahead of his time, who openly opposed profiting from our sick and disabled, and decentralizing and deregulating this county&#39;s healthcare under profit seeking insurance companies, while supporting this country&#39;s once very successful single privately owned non-profit healthcare system. A system that was once ranked first in the world instead of 37th by today&#39;s World Healthcare Organization (WHO). In discussing his concerns with President Ford, the President said, &quot;Our politicians have a strangle hold on healthcare, and the current system will have to collapse before it can get better.&quot; And you know what? He was right." />
