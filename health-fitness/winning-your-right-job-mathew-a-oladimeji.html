I have consulted books on the subject of having to change jobs. What stand Winning Your Right Job out are its outcome-focused instructions on how to do things; the way it teaches how not to do things in the course of seeking to move up and move on in highly competitive environments; as well as the way it seeks to develop the supervisory, managerial and leadership know-how in the individual&lt;br&gt;
