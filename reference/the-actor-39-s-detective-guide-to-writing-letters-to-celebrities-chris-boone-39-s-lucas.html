  <title>The Actor&#39;s Detective Guide to Writing Letters to Celebrities - Chris Boone&#39;s Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How would you like to get a personal letter or phone call from your favorite star? Or to have them send you an autographed item that can help you raise money for a charity? This book shows you exactly how to make those things happen! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Actor&amp;#39;s Detective Guide to Writing Letters to Celebrities,&amp;quot; is part memoir, part &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; guide. It tells the story of how a love for writing letters to famous people benefited the author, both personally and professionally. It&amp;#39;s something anyone can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this easy to follow book, you&amp;#39;ll find examples of letters (and letter writers) that have been successful in getting notable people to respond personally. It also explains the &amp;quot;do&amp;#39;s and don&amp;#39;ts&amp;quot; of contacting celebrities, very clearly laying out the steps of how to write to the stars in a way that compels them to get back to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A grammar school teacher recently read the book, and she said that it was extremely useful to her in getting her 4th grade students excited about writing. (Of course, kids are more enthusiastic about composing letters to LeBron James, J.K. Rowling, Will Smith or Justin Bieber than they are writing ones to Grandma, but it&amp;#39;s a good start.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this age of texting and 140 character tweets, letter writing has become a lost art. This book hopes to instill that passion back into its readers, and to remind them how powerful a personal letter can actually be in making a connection with someone they admire." />
