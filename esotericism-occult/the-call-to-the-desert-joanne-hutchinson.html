  <title>The Call to the Desert - Joanne Hutchinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about awakening to our greater potential and our greater purpose.  Joanne Hutchinson takes you on her personal journey to Egypt where she meets many people and travels to many places to discover more of her real and authentic self.  Along the way, she confronts her own fears and understands how she creates her own reality by what she thinks.  She meets face to face with disappointment and her own inner critic to find a deeper meaning to her journey and a level of peace that she has not felt before.  
&lt;p&gt;
She experiences poverty first hand in a village in Cairo.  She learns to discern the truth through the people she comes across and is humbled by all those that go out of their way to help her.  She sees the world through the eyes of the people she meets and develops a profound level of love, compassion and understanding that is life changing.  
&lt;p&gt;
Working with the energies of the temples, the desert and her spiritual guides, Joanne undergoes a healing journey that takes her to a new level of awareness, insight and wisdom.
&lt;p&gt;
Part of the proceeds of this book will be used fund projects in Egypt that change lives.  The first project is the Good Samaritan Orphanage in Luxor which is home to disabled children and abandoned elderly people." />
