  <title>Adventures in Boogieland - A.R. Bey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arcadia, Wisconsin seemed to be an ordinary town for Simon X, who wanted nothing
more than to be the best trumpeter ever. He and his classmates: Lulu DeBarge,
the harpist, Krupa Patel, the violinist, and Max Winehouse, the saxophonist, have
recently auditioned for the prestigious Bartholomew Performing Arts Academy. Shortly
thereafter, a twist of fate leads the children on an adventure out of this world when they
board a musical locomotive known as the Night Train.
By morning, they find themselves at a destination known as Boogieland. They encounter
a time-warped Trolley Car Diner with its Everlasting Jukebox, and Madame Charisma
Divine, an eccentric artist with a penchant for tuxedos, who guides them through
Boogieland, teaching them the miraculous wonders of her ways. Beleaguered by the
Shadows, the nefarious authority figures of Boogieland, the children ultimately discover
the miserable secrets haunting the Heartbreak Hotel.
Yet the children find an ally in the King of Pop, whose whimsical soda pop factory appeals
to their imaginative sensibilities with its countless amusement attractions complete with
scientific inventions, androids and more. A casual stroll through Paisley Park sends purple
rain and an untimely appearance from the iconic girl, who chased a white rabbit down
a hole. Will the childrens adventure become a Boogie Wonderland? Enter His Purple
Majesty, a master musician, who teaches the children an invaluable music lesson, which
prepares them for their greatest recital. Can Simon, Lulu, Krupa and Max overcome the
Shadows, and simply learn to unleash the music within?" />
