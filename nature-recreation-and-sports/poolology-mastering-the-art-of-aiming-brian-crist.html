  <title>Poolology - Mastering the Art of Aiming - Brian Crist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="***** eBook edition *****  Poolology is a breakthrough aiming system for pool players. I was once asked, &quot;How do you aim?&quot;, and I couldn&#39;t answer. I said I didn&#39;t know, and I&#39;m sure the player that asked me that thought I was holding out on him, keeping some great secret to myself. But it was true - other than to call it instinct, I had no idea how to aim. I&#39;d never been taught how to aim. I just shoot balls into the pocket. This question, &quot;How do you aim?&quot;, is what prompted me to write Poolology. After experimenting with various aiming systems, I learned that most aiming systems don&#39;t work for most people. That explains why so many pool players struggle to be consistent shot makers. I wanted to fix that. I wanted to find a system that could teach players how to aim any shot on the table, how to develop a feel for pocketing balls. No such system existed, until now. It&#39;s called Poolology!" />
