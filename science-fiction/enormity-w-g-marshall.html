  <title>Enormity - W. G. Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enormity is the strange tale of an American working in Korea, a lonely young man named Manny Lopes, who is not only physically small (in his own words, he&#39;s a &quot;Creole shrimp&quot;), but his work, his failed marriage, his race, all conspire to make him feel puny and insignificant-the proverbial ninety-eight-pound weakling. Then one day an accident happens, a quantum explosion, and suddenly Manny awakens to discover that he is big-really big. In fact, Manny is enormous, a mile-high colossus! Now there&#39;s no stopping him: he&#39;s a one-man weapon of mass destruction. Yet he means well. Enormity takes some odd turns, featuring characters like surfing gangbangers, elderly terrorists, and a North Korean assassin who thinks she&#39;s Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. There&#39;s also sex, violence, and action galore, with the army throwing everything it has against the rampaging colossus that is Manny Lopes. But there&#39;s only one weapon that has any chance at all of stopping him: his wife." />
