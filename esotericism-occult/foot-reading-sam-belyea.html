  <title>Foot Reading - Sam Belyea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Foot Reading is a book that dives into the wonderful world of foot assessment head-on, unlike any other. Incorporating the physical and mental/emotional meanings of the reflexes on the feet is the sole purpose of this text. Instead of showing the same version of a foot reflexology chart present in hundreds of other books, Sam Belyea describes in detail what the various foot pathologies such as dryness, bunions, swelling, and inflammation reveal about a persons internal and external circumstance with stunningly accurate detail. Because of the powerful information contained throughout these pages, it is recommended that any holistic-minded person or practitioner read it thoroughly and digest its concepts. 
You will embark with the basics of mapping the Horizontal Zones and Vertical Zones of Influence onto the feet, then advance to using the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water) to further clarify any markers present and finally emerging onto the hidden treasure of this book: how to provide a foot-reading consultation. With a combination of reflexology theory, elemental assessment, and coaching protocol, the reader will enjoy sitting down with friends, family, or clientele to share the insights present within the feet. But the journey does not stop there. Sam has also added a final section, teaching the reader to overlay foot-reading principles onto the hands, face, and ears as well, giving an extensive skill set to assess all four extremities with ease. 
Without a doubt, you are holding a revolutionary tome that will change the way you look at feet forever. Use this wisdom responsibly and carefully. Once you have learned to read feet, there is little a person can hide from your discerning eyes." />
