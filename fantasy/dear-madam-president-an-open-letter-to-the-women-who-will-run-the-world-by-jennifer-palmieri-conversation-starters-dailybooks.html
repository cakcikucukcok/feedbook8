  <title>Dear Madam President: An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World??????? by Jennifer Palmieri | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Dear Madam President: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Jennifer Palmieri | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jennifer Palmieri, former Communications Director of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential elections, thought that it was no big deal for America to elect a woman president because she thought it was widely acceptable for women to be equal to men. She soon realizes that, in fact,. women&amp;rsquo;s rights is still a new phenomenon to Americans. Hillary&amp;rsquo;s 40 years&amp;rsquo; success as a politician is unprecedented. She lost because people did not trust her due to her being a woman. In this book, Palmieri writes to the future Madam President and tells her to brace herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This #1 New York Times bestseller is hailed as a new map for future women leaders.&lt;br /&gt;

EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
