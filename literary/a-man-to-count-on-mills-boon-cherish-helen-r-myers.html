          &lt;strong&gt;She was looking for a man of justice.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dylan Justiss, that is. Because when high-powered district attorney E. D. Martel found her whole world falling apart, she needed one man she could trust who was upright, protective and fair. Sexy as hell was just a bonus. All his adult life, Dylan had been in love with E.D. (Eva Danielle) Martel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And now, when he was poised to have all his professional dreams come true, was hardly the time to make his move. Because E.D. was in trouble, big-time. And anyone who associated with her could kiss his reputation–not to mention his impending judgeship–goodbye. Too bad he found kissing E.D. more to his liking….&lt;/p&gt;
