  <title>With My Face to the Wind - Linda Anne King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like cancer untreated, PTSD can killif not the body the mind and soul. Linda King has portrayed, in real-time, what it is like to live with full-blown Post-traumatic stress disorder. She hopes to help to those who have carried the burdens of PTSD for years, and give the younger reader hope that will erase guilt and shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-help book is, ideally, just that. Lindas book is full of gems. Self-taught, she has gained the insight and wisdom not only to heal herself but others as well. She describes her long journey from barely surviving to thriving. Traumatic childhood events can shatter us in countless ways. Posttraumatic stress disorder impacts all aspects of the developing persona. For those who suffer PTSD, this book offers many ahas toward wholeness and self-recovery: emotional, physical and, miraculously, spiritual. I believe you will find comfort here that helps you make the journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Lynne Dushan, LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda King has creatively fused psychology, spirituality and humor as she takes us on her healing journey in With My Face to the Wind. While sharing some of her personal tragedies, she weaves in just enough verifiable psychological content (without causing brain freeze) to know that shes done her homework. Her wit and humor shine through just in the nick of time &lt;/p&gt;
