  <title>A Haunting at Richelieu High - Bob Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For KC Watson, the first day of school was always unusual.  This was especially true of her first day of freshman year at Richelieu High School.  KC was a girl who could never resist a good mystery - and Penelope Dredalus, a new student at Richelieu High School, was exactly that.  Penelope was quiet and mysterious.
As KC begins to unravel the truth about Penelope, she realizes there is a bigger mystery to be solved as strange and frightening things start to happen at Richelieu High.
KC and Penelope form a reluctant partnership as they investigate unexplained sounds and bizaare apparitions and a tragic accident that occurred in the school decades ago.
Can two teenage girls stand against a powerful entity that is poised to take its vengeance out against the entire school?" />
