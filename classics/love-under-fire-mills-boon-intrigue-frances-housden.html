          &lt;strong&gt;Two years ago Rowan McQuaid paid the ultimate price when he took a bullet meant for fellow cop Jo Jellic, causing permanent damage to both himself and his career.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Rowan had arrived in the town of Nicks Landing to investigate an insurance claim and was standing face-to-face with the woman whose life he&#39;d never regretted saving. In the time since he&#39;d last seen her, Jo had gone from beautiful to stunning, making their professional relationship fraught with a powerful, sizzling attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And as they tracked a criminal hell-bent on revenge, Rowan found himself struggling to keep his feelings under wraps and his passion for his partner from bursting into flames.&lt;/p&gt;
