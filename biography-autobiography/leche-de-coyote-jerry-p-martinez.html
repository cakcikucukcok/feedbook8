  <title>Leche De Coyote - Jerry P. Martinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The beginning of this book is the story of my life followed by the life of my ancestors. I start with my own story, not a story of a hero. Its not a about a famous baseball player that I envisioned in my dreams. My story doesnt involve any spy adventures like the books I enjoy reading. Rather my life I share with you is about a boy born in the hills of Northern New Mexico. Its about a kid that lived the first five years of my life in one of the most impoverished counties in the United States.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       My story recognizes the important role my mother Fedelina, played in my life. She gave me and my siblings the opportunity to be educated. Because of her efforts I became educated in the Catholic School system. Because of her foresight I grew up in Santa Cruz, New Mexico, and became educated in the Catholic tradition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       Its about a person that carried through his Mothers wishes. The world she opened led me to become one of the first members of the Martinezs clan to get a College degree. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Its about a career that starts in the New Mexico State capitol and winds up in the California Aerospace Industry. Its about a person that is proud of his heritage, proud of his family, and proud of his country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      My life has been driven by a philosophy learned from the experiences of others.  I recognized the importance of learned experiences so I embraced what they shared with me. I adopted their experiences as my own. I lost my father at an early age so I really couldnt use him as a model for learning. I listened to the elders where ever and whenever the occasion presented itself. I learned to avoid the bad and accept what I perceived to be good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Those of my parents; Andres and Fedelina follow my own story. The others that follow are those of their parents and grandparents. I have enjoyed doing research on them, and it has been especially rewarding to actually put all these stories on paper.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    My family comprising of both the Martinez Clan and the Archuletas number in the hundreds. Papatin and Mama Ignacita had thirteen children; the Archuletas Papa Esquipula and Mama Aleja had seven children.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     Without a doubt some of these relatives can share much more interesting memoirs than mine. I have knowledge of many interesting stories about them. My uncles served our Country during World War II as some of my older cousins did. Im sure they can relate to some very interesting experiences during those times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Documentation that contains historical data on our ancestors is available for those interested in Genealogy.  The Catholic Churches and missions throughout the southwest have kept records dating back to the colonization of the New World.  Other agencies like the United States Census Bureau, The New Mexico Genealogical society and the Organized Church of the Latter Day Saints also maintain information on settlers coming to live in the New World.  Information exists on almost every US citizen; all it takes is hours of research. 
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Also in the past, information about ones ancestors was passed on either written or orally.  Ancestors would keep records in Bibles or in books theyd written themselves.  It was also very common for the family elders to repeat tales during campfire gatherings or around the dinner table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       My first recollection of tales involving ancestors was my Grandma Ignacita talking about her side of the family. I remember these tales being told over and over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The story of my maternal grandfather, Luciano Herrera is one that I heard over and over.  Mother used to repeat stories relating to him, to a point that I became familiar and intrigued with his life story. I started to do research on him only to discover that genealogy could be fascinating which lead me to do further research on my other ancestors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
