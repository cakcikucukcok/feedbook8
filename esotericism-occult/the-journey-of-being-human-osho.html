  <title>The Journey of Being Human - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers invites you onto the path that takes you through all of life&#39;s experiences and to embrace your own humanity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man is a bridge, says Osho, between the animal and the divine--and our awareness of this dual aspect of our nature is what makes us human. It is also what makes us restless, full of conflict, so often at the crossroads of selfishness and generosity, of love and hate, frailty and strength, hope and despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Journey of Being Human: Is It Possible to Find Real Happiness in Ordinary Life?&lt;/i&gt; looks into how we might embrace and accept these apparent contradictions, rather than trying to choose between them, as the key to transforming each twist and turn of life&#39;s journey into a new discovery of who we are meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
