  <title>The Gentle Messenger - Rebecca Bartlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Professional psychic Rebecca Bartlett details her journey as a psychic from her teen years on with true stories of her experiences in pre-cognition, medical intuition and mediumship.  Prophetic dreams were her first indication that she had a special ability.  She tells of her desire to help humanity in the face of skeptics, insults and challenges in being recognized by those who could use her ability to save lives.  Bartlett concludes with a review of scientific literature verifying the psychic experience.   &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                           &lt;p&gt;Praise From Her Clients:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I have known or worked with physicians, holistic practitioners, therapists, native medicine men, psychiatrists, psychics, mediums and channels, all of whom were respected in their fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never met anyone more gifted or accurate than Rebecca as a medical intuitive or as one who perceives another&#39;s individual nature and unique attributes. It is our great good fortune that she chooses to use her abilities that she has had from birth in the service of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cinda Crull MS, MDiv, MFT&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Rebecca has a true talent, and I highly recommend her to family, friends, and anyone desiring a psychic reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pam Thrash, Radio and Television personality&lt;/p&gt;
