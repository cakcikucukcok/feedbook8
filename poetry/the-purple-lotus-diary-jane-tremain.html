She is originally from Carshalton Surrey, United Kingdom, a mother of three children and is hard of hearing. This book is full of inspiration and passion, love and romance and friendships. When I listen to music and songs, the words would come to my mind, and I see visions that will suddenly take me to my pen and write them from my heart.

You will be able to feel the experiences and the emotions and be enlightened with my words and shall certainly be touched with my own spirit.
