      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is good for Dallas. Semi-retired with just enough occasional action to keep the blood pumping, he lives in a fancy estate with a million-dollar view on an island near Trinidad.

&lt;p&gt;The investigation brings the DEAs Assistant Director Cox to Dallass doorstep, and life is soon turned upside-down. He and his pals are forced back into the criminal underground. With the help of Captain Bob and Marboy, Dallas pays a visit to old enemies, and its personal this time. Hes going to end what he started, DEA investigation or no. Its time to finish Skeets for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second in the Dallas Streeter Chronicles, Highways continues the tail of daring exploits and outlaw adventures. Its filled with old vendettas, dirty DEA agents, and various characters of questionable repute. Take a ride by land, air, and sea from the Southern Caribbean to Belize, Jamaica, and more as Dallas races to settle the score and save his brother.&lt;/p&gt;" />
