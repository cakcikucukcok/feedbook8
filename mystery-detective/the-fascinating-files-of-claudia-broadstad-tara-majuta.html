  <title>The Fascinating Files of Claudia Broadstad - Tara Majuta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Claudia Broadstad, born and raised in Roswell, New Mexico, has always had a knack for looking for problems to solve. She hoped to follow in her fathers footsteps and join him in putting away the bad guys; Bernie Broadstad was well known for his crime-fighting knowledge and dedication to protect. When he mysteriously disappears, however, Claudia is left all alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years later, she is now an amateur private investigator and is still engaged in the search for her father when a letter arrives for him, begging for help in a strange string of murders in Victoria, Maryland. Claudia is snarky and self-made; shes not the ideal candidate to solve a multiple murder, but she takes the case on anyway, with the help of her friends, Patrick and Bonnie. Even so, she might be in over her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they search for the killer, they also continue the search for Claudias missing father, but nothing is easy. This killer is good, and theres no sign of Bernie. Using leads borrowed from local police, Claudia is on the hunt. This is her first case on her own, and if she isnt careful, Victoria could become a town full of victims.&lt;/p&gt;" />
