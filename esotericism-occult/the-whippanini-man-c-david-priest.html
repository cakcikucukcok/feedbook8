  <title>The Whippanini Man - C. David Priest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was the winter of 1947 when C. David Priest, then five years old, first hears his aunt Rosalee tell the vivid and frightening story of the Whippanini man, a strange presence that only comes out when darkness falls. Terrified and curious all at the same time, it is later that same night after David falls asleep that he sees the Whippanini man for the first time, forever transforming his innocent life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the spectral presence haunts David in his sleep, his aunt relays more stories that cause him to begin to question everything in his lifeand all who have passed away before him, including a cousin reported to have looked just like David. But at night, nothing can stop Whippanini from invading Davids dreams, at least temporarily, and seemingly warning him of tragic events about to occur. As the years pass and Whippanini disappears, David wonders if the presence was just a figment of his childhood imagination. Little does he know that the Whippanini man is about to make his presence known again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Whippanini Man&lt;/i&gt; shares one mans struggle with a fearful manifestation as he walks back into his past and he hopes to find his true self.&lt;/p&gt;" />
