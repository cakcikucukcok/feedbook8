  <title>Sensitivity and Cultural Multiplexity in Recent Indian English Poetry - Dr. Rama V. B. Rama Rama Rao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contemporary poetic imagination is related to the actuality around which is the basis for thematic content in our poets. There is emphasis on the feelings about life, living, and our tradition and ethos. Poetry is being cherished as portrayal of our aspirations, ambitions, conditions of our sensitivity and sensibility and cultural multiplexity. The poets included in this book are only analyzed and not compared in this work. English poetry written by our poets during the last fifteen years reveals the poets&amp;#39; love and devotion to our tradition and to the actuality seen, experienced and ruminated upon. The observation, understanding and imaginative analysis of the actuality around is &amp;#39;nativism&amp;#39;. This has drawn the attention of our poets. Regionalism in literary expression is not parochial narrow mindedness. It is a literary category in our aesthetic. These are some of the considerations behind the selection of the fourteen poets in the book. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
