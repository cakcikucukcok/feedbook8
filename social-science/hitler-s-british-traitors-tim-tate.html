  <title>Hitler’s British Traitors - Tim Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p &gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hitler’s British Traitors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; is the first authoritative
account of a well-kept secret: the British Fifth Column and its activities
during the Second World War.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;Drawing on hundreds of declassified
official files – many of them previously unpublished – Tim Tate uncovers the
largely unknown history of more than 70 British traitors who were convicted,
mostly in secret trials, of working to help Nazi Germany win the war, and
several hundred British Fascists who were interned without trial on evidence
that they were working on behalf of the enemy. Four were condemned to death;
two were executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_Hlk501117564&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_Hlk501117564&quot;&gt;This
engrossing book reveals the extraordinary methods adopted by MI5 to uncover
British traitors and their German spymasters, as well as &lt;/a&gt;two serious wartime plots by
well-connected British fascists to mount a &lt;i&gt;coup d’etat&lt;/i&gt; which
would replace the government with an authoritarian pro-Nazi regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;The book also shows how archaic
attitudes to social status and gender in Whitehall and the courts ensured that
justice was neither fair nor equitable. Aristocratic British pro-Nazi
sympathizers and collaborators were frequently protected while the
less-privileged foot soldiers of the Fifth Column were interned, jailed or even
executed for identical crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
