  <title>The Isle of Women - Hank Manley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        A vicious hegemony has descended on charming Isla Mujeres, a tiny island off the coast of Cancun. A gang of Cubans has formed an extortion ring to suck
        the profits from the shopkeepers, restaurateurs, and bar owners. By what insidious method does the Cuban Mafia control the populace of the Isle of
        Women?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The murderous Mexican Rafael Zapata offers Rhonda and Morgan Early, and their friend Daisy Bain, one million dollars to defeat the Cubans. The three
        adventurers travel to Isla Mujeres and attempt to gather information on the gang so they can form a plan of attack. Their efforts are completely
        stonewalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Daisy concocts a scheme to learn about the gang. She fails and is tortured for her efforts. Morgans impatience with their progress to ascertain the
        strength of the gang, the location of the headquarters, and the name of the leader backfires.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Rhonda is left to single-handedly save her beloved husband and best friend. Can she summon help among the women of the island? How can she ultimately
        defeat the cabal of ruthless Cubans who have infested every business on the peaceful island?
    &lt;/p&gt;
