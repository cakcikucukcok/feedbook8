  <title>Discord&#39;s Apple - Carrie Vaughn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Evie Walker goes home to spend time with her dying father, she discovers that his creaky old house in Hope&#39;s Fort, Colorado, is not the only legacy she stands to inherit. Hidden behind the old basement door is a secret and magical storeroom, a place where wondrous treasures from myth and legend are kept safe until they are needed again. The magic of the storeroom prevents access to any who are not intended to use the items. But just because it has never been done does not mean it cannot be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are certainly those who will give anything to find a way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evie must guard the storeroom against ancient and malicious forces, protecting the past and the future even as the present unravels around them. Old heroes and notorious villains alike will rise to fight on her side or to undermine her most desperate gambits. At stake is the fate of the world, and the prevention of nothing less than the apocalypse. In the same month, along with this all-new hardcover, Tor will publish a new novel in Carrie Vaughn&#39;s popular, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling urban fantasy series featuring werewolf talk radio host, Kitty Norville. &lt;i&gt;Kitty Goes to War &lt;/i&gt;will be the eighth book in this successful mass market series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
