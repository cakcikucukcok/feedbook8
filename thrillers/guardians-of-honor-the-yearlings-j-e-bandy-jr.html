  <title>Guardians of Honor: the Yearlings - J.E. Bandy Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;J.E. Bandy, Jr. has written an engrossing, exciting sequel to Cadet Casey Sullivans first year at West Point. I highly recommend this book and am anxiously awaiting volume III. &lt;br /&gt; 
--John Raymond, USMA 1964, Attorney at Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When old enemies form alliances with new and more treacherous adversaries, Casey Sullivans undercover assignment becomes more complicated and more dangerous in part two of this exciting Christian Thriller. With Caseys help, the United States Military Academy scored a major victory against right-wing extremists attempting to infiltrate West Point during the previous academic year. However, unknown to the academys leadership, its victory only strengthened the enemys resolve. In &lt;em&gt;Guardians of Honor: the Yearlings&lt;/em&gt;, the US Intelligence Community and the Israeli Mossad become increasingly aware of a larger and deadlier plot against the American homeland, a plot with deep roots and international implications; a plot that Casey learns has a name--Operation Patriot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, Casey finds herself engaged in a delicate dance between her Christian values and operational necessity, and between the high standards of West Points Honor Code and the murky chasm of moral relativism. Casey gains mentors in unexpected places and on opposite sides of critical ethical issues, edging her closer and closer towards a dark night of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardians of Honor series is a groundbreaking exploration of West Point and the Intelligence Community seen through the eyes of female officers and cadets on the firing line.&lt;/p&gt;" />
