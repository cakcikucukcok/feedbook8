  <title>Margaret Wise Brown - Leonard S. Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Leonard S. Marcus... has masterfully written about a fascinating woman who in her short life changed literature for the very young. I was throroughly enchanted.&quot;--Eric Carle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly fifty years after her sudden death at the age of forty-two, Margaret Wise Brown remains a legend and an enigma. Author of &lt;em&gt;Goodnight Moon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Runaway Bunny&lt;/em&gt;, and dozens of other children&#39;s classics, Brown all but invented the picture book as we know it today. Combining poetic instinct with a profound empathy for small children, she understood a child&#39;s need for security, love, and a sense of being at home in the world. Yet, these were comforts that had eluded her. Her sparkling presence and her unparalleled success as a legendary children&#39;s book author masked an insecurity that left her restless and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this authoritative and moving biography, Leonard S. Marcus, who had access to never-before-published letters and family papers, portrays Brown&#39;s complex character and her tragic, seesaw life. Colorful, thoughtful, and insightful, &lt;em&gt;Margaret Wise Brown&lt;/em&gt; is both a portrayal of a woman whose stories still speak to millions and a portrait of New York in the 1930s and 1940s, when the literary world blossomed and made history. &lt;/p&gt;" />
