  <title>Blackwater Moon - B. Michael Radburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TWO BOYS, BATTERED BY DRUNK FATHERS – ONE BECOMES A SERIAL KILLER, THE OTHER HIS PREY … AND HIS NEMESIS 
A STORY OF SECRETS AND THE QUEST FOR REDEMPTION 
“Redemption is born of guilt, and weighs heavy on even the strongest man.” – Stephen King 
Set in the small, isolated community of Blackwater… Blackwater Moon is a story of secrets and the quest for redemption. Spanning the lives of two people, the victim and the perpetrator… Blackwater Moon explores the consequences of living with a past shaped by life’s tragedies and how a single shared incident shapes their lives forever. 
Andy Walker, son, lover, and an ex-soldier, knows tragedy is only ever a heartbeat away. 
When an inmate escapes from the prison farm upriver and abducts Nathan, a child Andy has vowed to protect after losing his own son years before, Walker draws on his inner soldier to deliver Nathan from harm, discovering that the escapee is a dark figure from his past, the devil who changed his life, the man who introduced him as a child to ‘The Game’. 
The story ends as it began, with the same two people on the banks of Blackwater’s river – only this time Walker has a gun and a choice to make. And so in the end, Blackwater may keep just one more secret…
