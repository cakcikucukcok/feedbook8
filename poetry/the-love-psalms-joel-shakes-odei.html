  <title>The Love Psalms - Joel &quot;Shakes&quot; Odei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love is sweet when it is new.
It is sweeter when it is true,
But sweetest when it is you.
Loving you is as easy as breathing.
With a look into your eyes, I see possibilities.
You dot my is, you cross my ts.
You make me a man complete.
This book not only presents readers with everyday poetry to spice up their love lives but also inspires readers and fires their imaginations to be creative and write their own poems for that special person. 
With the use of simple, everyday vocabulary to create and describe several moods and scenery, it is easy to relate to the poems in this book, and there is one suitable poem for almost every situation in which one finds oneself.
With a touch of humour, the poems also guarantee some smiles on the readers face, presenting an escape route from lifes stressful routine.
This book helps us to appreciate the little things that life presents to us: the memories of the past, the hopes of the future, and the gift of the present." />
