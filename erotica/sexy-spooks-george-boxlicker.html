  <title>Sexy Spooks - George Boxlicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here are two fun short novellas of sex with ghosts. Nobody gets hurt and everybody has fun, but the descriptions of the sex are very detailed and the language is explicit, so this book is intended only for adults.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from &amp;quot;Melanie and Me in the Haunted House&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since she had survived her husband, if only by hours, she inherited the house and land and the property should have subsequently been passed on to her niece and only heir.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melanie had been just a baby then and, by the age she was old enough to want to take possession of the house, it had gained an extremely unpleasant reputation. According to people in the neighborhood, the ghosts of the two women haunted the house and sexually abused anybody they caught there late at night. Even local homeless men preferred sleeping in cardboard boxes in alleys over staying in the ramshackle old place. Although I have always believed in ghosts, that is, that humans have a spirit that leaves the body upon death, I did not believe in the malevolence of those spirits, largely because I did not believe they would be able to hurt anybody. Sometimes a spirit could be sensed in a place where the former living person had habituated, but there would be nothing tangible and nothing at all dangerous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used to believe that but, since spending that night in the haunted house with Melanie, I have drastically revised my beliefs. Since she had no other friend or relative who was close enough to ask and willing to join her, Melanie wanted me to stay with her. I had no problem agreeing, first:&amp;nbsp; because I always do anything, within reason, that my lady friends ask me to do and, second and probably more importantly because it sounded like fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt from &amp;quot;Graveyard Lovers&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most recent off the wall thing she got me to do was go with her to the local cemetery on the first anniversary of her husband&amp;#39;s death, so we could make love on his grave. I always do what my lady friends ask of me, within reason, and I considered this activity to be just barely inside those rather nebulous boundaries. I won&amp;#39;t do it next year, even if she asks, which is highly unlikely. The fact that her husband died on Halloween didn&amp;#39;t make the idea any more appealing, even though I am not superstitious, because I still felt edgy about being in a cemetery on that particular night. Samantha thought my reluctance was just being silly, and accused me of believing in ghosts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have always believed there is some kind of spirit that leaves the body at death but, until that night, I did not believe in inimical ghosts, or that those spirits had any solidity. Besides that, Samantha&amp;#39;s accusation goaded me just enough to agree to do something I didn&amp;#39;t really feel like doing. I have had sex in some unusual places but, on top of a lady friend&amp;#39;s late husband&amp;#39;s grave on Halloween night would be a first time for me. The last time, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, it came to pass that, at eleven o&amp;#39;clock on the night of October 31, I drove just outside of town to the cemetery where Samantha&amp;#39;s husband was pushing up daisies. The sidewalk leading inside was open, but the driveway was blocked by a very solid ornamental gate. I could have crashed through the barrier but, not wanting to add vandalism to trespassing and whatever other laws we would be breaking, I parked down the road from the grounds and we walked back and entered." />
