  <title>Far from Land - Michael Brooke, Bruce Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seabirds evoke the spirit of the earth&#39;s wildest places. They spend large portions of their lives at sea, often far from land, and nest on beautiful and remote islands that humans rarely visit. Thanks to the development of increasingly sophisticated and miniaturized devices that can track their every movement and behavior, it is now possible to observe the mysterious lives of these remarkable creatures as never before. This beautifully illustrated book takes you on a breathtaking journey around the globe to reveal where these birds actually go when they roam the sea, the tactics they employ to traverse vast tracts of ocean, the strategies they use to evade threats, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Brooke has visited every corner of the world in his lifelong pursuit of seabirds. Here, he draws on his own experiences and insights as well as the latest cutting-edge science to shed light on the elusive seafaring lives of albatrosses, frigatebirds, cormorants, and other ocean wanderers. Where do puffins go in the winter? How deep do penguins dive? From how far away can an albatross spot a fishing vessel worth following for its next meal? Brooke addresses these and other questions in this delightful book. Along the way, he reveals that seabirds are not the aimless wind-tossed creatures they may appear to be, and explains the observational innovations that are driving this exciting area of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring illustrations by renowned artist Bruce Pearson and packed with intriguing facts,&lt;i&gt; Far from Land&lt;/i&gt; provides an extraordinary up-close look at the activities of seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
