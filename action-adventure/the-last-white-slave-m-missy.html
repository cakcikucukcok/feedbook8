  <title>The Last White Slave - M Missy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE LAST WHITE SLAVE!
PART  TWO
Based in real history comes a story like none ever told!
A story of the old South; where bondage, domination, submission, and humiliation were real and not a game people played.
An entertaining thriller which will;
Educated you,			Sadden you,
	Excite you, 			Anger you,
		Shock you,			Make you cry,
			Maybe all at the same time.
Hello; my name is Matthew Michael McCall III; this is my story.
The story of my life as the last white slave.
The story of the worst President in the history of the United States;
A story about the Civil War; Abraham Lincolns war; 
			KING ABRAHAM LINCOLN!!!!!!!!!
KING Abraham Lincoln caused the needless murder and or maiming of over 700,000 Americans.
My story; a love story of the unbelievable kind.
A story with an explosive ending; you should be surprised.
A story that suggests slavery was never outlawed in the United States; thats right the 13th amendment to the constitution Abraham Lincoln says was passed may not have been passed; Slavery may still be legal.
KING Lincoln knew that; but what does a self-appointed KING care about the law? Not much as it turned out." />
