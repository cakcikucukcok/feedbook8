  <title>The Wish Child - Catherine Chidgey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“ A tour de force, a work of art, an insightful commentary on the horrors and pointlessness of war and violence, a love story . . . so beautifully written that it hurts . . . Gripping from start to finish . . . One of the best novels I have read this year. Actually, maybe one of the best novels I have read, period.” —&lt;i&gt;Booksellers NZ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany, 1939. Two children watch as their parents become immersed in the puzzling mechanisms of power. Siggi lives in the affluent ignorance of middle-class Berlin, her father a censor who excises prohibited words (&quot;promise&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;mercy&quot;) from books. Erich is an only child living a lush rural life near Leipzig, tending beehives, aware that he is shadowed by strange, unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawn together as Germany&#39;s hope for a glorious future begins to collapse, the children find temporary refuge in an abandoned theater amid the rubble of Berlin. Outside, white bedsheets hang from windows; all over the city people are talking of surrender. The days Siggi and Erich spend together will shape the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching over Siggi and Erich is the wish child, the mysterious narrator of their story. He sees what they see, he feels what they feel, yet his is a voice that comes from deep inside the wreckage of a nation&#39;s dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
