  <title>Andean Journeys: a Bilingual Anthology of Contemporary Bolivian Poetry - Ronald Haladyna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Andean Journeys: A Bilingual Anthology of Contemporary Bolivian Poetry is the fourth in a series of books that aspire to address a dearth of information in the English-speaking world about South American poetry of the past thirty years. The fourteen outstanding poets included here represent a diversity of themes, styles, and perspectives in one of South Americas more marginalized nations. All of them have published extensively, have been recognized through literary awards and inclusion in national and international anthologies, and continue writing and publishing today. 
For readers unfamiliar with Bolivia, the introduction provides a brief background of its geography, history, politics, economy, and society. This is followed by an ample selection of representative poems published previously in Spanish, with translations in English on facing pages. The book concludes with a brief biographical sketch of each poet and an extensive bibliography of primary and secondary sources for readers wishing to pursue further reading or research. Contemporary Uruguayan Poetry: A Bilingual Anthology;  Exotic Territory: A Bilingual Anthology of Contemporary Paraguayan Poetry; and Volcanic Reflections: A Bilingual Anthology of  Contemporary Ecuadorian Poetry are companion volumes that offer similar exposure to poetry that deserves to be better known in the English-speaking world." />
