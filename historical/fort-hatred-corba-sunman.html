      <meta name="description" content="A puff of gun smoke erupted from the broken window and Moran fired at it without seeming to aim. A bullet whined past his head and he fired two more shots through the window while moving for cover at the right-hand side of the shack. A man emerged at a run from the ramshackle building, triggering a stream of lead at Moran, who dropped to one knee, his gun replying with deadly accuracy. The man fell face-down in the dust and did not move again. Moran got up and ran to the front window. He saw movement there and tossed a slug into it. A man pitched to the floor inside the shack. Moran reached the window, gasping, breath searing his throat, shoulders heaving. Sweat was running down his face. &#39;Hold your fire, Soldier-boy,&#39; Shorten yelled from inside. &#39;My two men are down and done for. They started shooting against my orders. I ain&#39;t fool enough to tangle with the Army while I&#39;m working for them.&#39;  &#39;Come out of the shack with your hands up,&#39; Moran rasped." />
