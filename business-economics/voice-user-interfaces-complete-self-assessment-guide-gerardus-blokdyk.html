  <title>Voice User Interfaces Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do we aggressively reward and promote the people who have the biggest impact on creating excellent Voice User Interfaces services/products? Does Voice User Interfaces analysis isolate the fundamental causes of problems? How much are sponsors, customers, partners, stakeholders involved in Voice User Interfaces? In other words, what are the risks, if Voice User Interfaces does not deliver successfully? What are your most important goals for the strategic Voice User Interfaces objectives? What are the compelling business reasons for embarking on Voice User Interfaces? 
&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
For more than twenty years, The Art of Service&#39;s Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better.
