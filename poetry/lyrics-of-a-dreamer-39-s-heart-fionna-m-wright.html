  <title>Lyrics of a Dreamer&#39;s Heart - Fionna M. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is a continuous series of lessons in love, pain, healing, and growth. Author Fionna Wright has never been comfortable talking about her deepest emotions and thoughts, but those feelings were real and needed to be processed. At a young age, she found comfort and healing in writing. It has always been her truth, her escape, and her safe place. She has written &lt;i&gt;Lyrics of a Dreamers Heart&lt;/i&gt; for other dreamers like herthose who seldom share their deepest thoughts but live by them nonetheless. Though writing was her passion, until now, it was also her secret. She did not share her passion with many people and only recently began to embrace it as something that she could share with others with the hope of helping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a substantial amount of pain, heartache, self-exploration, and healing, she made the decision to share her experiences with others who may be going through similar challenges in their lives. &lt;i&gt;Lyrics of a Dreamers Heart&lt;/i&gt; is an honest, pure, raw look into her heart and soul through her lifes journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Purest Love&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Worldly restrictions and judgments cannot obstruct&lt;/br&gt;
love in its purest form.&lt;/br&gt;
Searching for love in its purest form can be destructive.&lt;/br&gt;
Finding love in its purest form can be healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find love for all&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
