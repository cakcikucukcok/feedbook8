  <title>New Guinea Diary - Sidney Goldman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A direct transcription from a one-year diary kept while serving as a physician in a jungle outpost in New Guinea.
Formatted with bold dated entries to keep the reader interested from start to finish. 
Laugh and cry with Perry Goldman MD and cheer for him when tiny successes are achieved.
WWII in the Pacific began brutally for the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Establishing outposts far across the ocean after having lost so many ships was a daunting task.
Port Moresby, a small city in the southeast corner of New Guinea became a tenuous beginning foothold in an attempt to curb the Japanese expansion. 
American physicians of all ages enlisted in the armed forces. Perry Goldman MD was already 33 years old, married with a three year old son and practicing General Medicine in Detroit Michigan when he joined the fight. 
Without much in the way of intensive training for his role he was rapidly assigned temporary duty in San Francisco and shortly thereafter flown overseas to Australia and then transferred by train and airplane to a small jungle post outside of Port Moresby. 
Perry began a personal diary the day he left San Francisco in November of 1942 and continued daily entries for exactly one year. His inner strength, emotional resilience and diverse observations of war, army politics, fellow soldiers and even humorous interjections have been transcribed by his son Sidney Goldman MD as a work of remembrance and respect. Intended originally for Perry&#39;s family and friends, the work has great appeal for anyone interested in this segment of the war since very few of the surviving participants spoke openly about their difficult experiences during their lifetime.
In fact after concluding his one year diary with a question as to when and if he would come home alive Perry remained in the Pacific an additional ten months thereby totaling 22 months in the region. 
The diary is filled with thoughts, wishes, prayers and hopes throughout and the reader will identify with Perry&#39;s distress and also learn his eventual fate with addendum added by the author.
Photographs inserted were copied from Perry&#39;s own collection adding visual testimony to some of the entries." />
