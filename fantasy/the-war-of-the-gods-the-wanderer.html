  <title>The War of the Gods - The Wanderer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the amazing world of &lt;i&gt;The War of the Gods,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a little boy, named Calven, has found&lt;br&gt;
himself alone and he was wandering&lt;br&gt;
the world with a dark past occupying&lt;br&gt;
his mind. As Calven wandered he shows&lt;br&gt;
purity and gentleness. With that he has&lt;br&gt;
made a few friends who would&lt;br&gt;
help him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, life was pretty normal&lt;br&gt;
for him or as normal as it&lt;br&gt;
would be, other than having&lt;br&gt;
strange dreams every night.&lt;br&gt;
His life was nothing special&lt;br&gt;
until this boy finds a ninja who&lt;br&gt;
was being chased by demons&lt;br&gt;
of the underworld and a griffin that&lt;br&gt;
was caged beneath an abandoned house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ninja asks Calven for help escape the demons. Calven also&lt;br&gt;
links minds with the griffin, and it tells this wandering boy that&lt;br&gt;
he was, The One. After that the boys life would never be&lt;br&gt;
the same. He has realized a life of legend with many exciting&lt;br&gt;
adventures involving demons and gods&lt;/p&gt;" />
