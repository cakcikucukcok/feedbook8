  <title>Pilgrimage to Memphis - Paul J Hock, Robert Miller, Silvana Sangiuliano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charles Parker awoke in a cold sweat.&amp;nbsp;He knew it was all a dream, but he swore it was real. He knew the Sergeant in this dream was his father. But Charles felt like it was him, like he was taking his father&amp;#39;s place, in his skin.&amp;nbsp;seeing, touching, feeling everything his dad had experienced, on that fateful day in 1944. It was crazy, his dad had never told him about what happened in the war.&amp;nbsp;Only a vague reference, to how a corporal had, &amp;quot;saved his butt&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
The dreams had started when he was in his 50&amp;rsquo;s, as he grew older they became more and more vivid, more real. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only dream, they all reflected around a host of memories, of regrets, things that had not been done, or that should have been done differently. Charles had made a list of them and vowed he would make them right. Now he was an 86 year-old man, in a retirement home, with a heart condition.&amp;nbsp;How could he possibly make things right?&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s when he met Evan, a young musician that was performing at the home.&amp;nbsp;Their friendship, set into motion a series of impossible events. Events that would see a dying wish by Charles, fulfilled by the young man, as he set out on &amp;quot;A Pilgrimage to Memphis&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
