  <title>Playing for the Hoops - Aidan Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;How did George McCluskey become one of Celtic F.C.’s most memorable football players? What binds the fans and players and creates this strong sense of belonging? And what does the Irish diaspora have to do with Celtic F.C.?
 George McCluskey was one of the key strikers for the Hoops in the ‘70s and ‘80s, a successful time in the club’s history. He did not only score for his team, but changed the entire game in favour of Celtic more than once. In this account of his life story told by his close friend Aidan Donaldson and his son Barry McCluskey, George McCluskey is praised as the embodiment of the Celtic spirit. His individual history is intertwined with the history and mentality of the club. However, George McCluskey did not only influence Celtic F.C. but also other clubs he played for and the people he has met during his life.
 This book takes you on a journey through the development of the club from its very beginning, as well as exploring the evolution of football in general. How did we get from football legends like George McCluskey to football celebrities like David Beckham? What did professional football look like back then, what constitutes it nowadays?
 This timely book will appeal not only to Celtic supporters, but to anyone interested in the development of professional football.
 His exuberant celebration depicted on the cover of the book remains iconic in the eyes of Celtic supporters today. His Cup winning goal led inadvertently to a riot and the banning of alcohol in Scottish football grounds.&quot;" />
