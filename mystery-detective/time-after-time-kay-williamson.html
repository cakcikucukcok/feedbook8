  <title>Time After Time - Kay Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pamela Ryan&#39;s marriage is over, but her emotionally disturbed husband, Norman, tells her he&#39;d rather kill her than to let her go. The stress of her disastrous marriage finally catches up with her in a mysterious way. In a Scottish tearoom, she finds herself lapsing into a Scottish dialect. Suspecting her strange behavior is in some way related to reincarnation, she, without telling Norman, seeks the help of past-life regression therapist Dr. Martin Bradford. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Under hypnosis, Pamela discovers she was Sarah MacAllister, a young Scottish girl engaged to Robyn Macqueen. As session after session reveals the details of Pamela&#39;s past life-of her death and her grief-stricken fianc&#39;s suicide, she and Dr. Bradford grow closer. But Pamela doesn&#39;t fully understand the pull of her attraction towards her therapist until she discovers that Dr. Martin Bradford was none other than Robyn Macqueen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
In spite of Norman&#39;s murderous threats, the reunited lovers make plans to flee the country and to look for their past-life parents. But when Norman discovers their plans, he vows to find and kill them. &lt;/p&gt;" />
