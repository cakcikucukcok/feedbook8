  <title>A Pilgrim&#39;s History of the Rosary - Greg Firnstahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am proud to know the author of this book, which is the best I have ever seen on the Rosary. Greg spent many years studying about the Rosary. His description of the Fifteen Mysteries is the best I have ever seen. As a boy I prayed three Rosaries each day, and still do.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have given away 1,000 Rosaries each month. Now I am thrilled to send copies of this book to as many people as possible.&lt;br /&gt;- Daniel Lyons, The Spiritual Newsletter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dear friends, over the years I have given prayer to this writing. I would like to say that I have reached spiritual heights, but I have not. I would like to claim a perfect Christian life, but I am still growing. I want to say I pray the Rosary perfectly and have achieved a deep union with God, but I am still maturing. However, I have learned to walk with God and continually ask him to keep working with me (Mk. 16:20). For me, the Rosary has made me a better Christian, more Christ-like, a little more understanding about life and people. I look at this writing the same way the little child in the Scriptures looked at his five loaves and two fish he gave the Lord. It is a small offering (John 6:9ff).&lt;/p&gt;" />
