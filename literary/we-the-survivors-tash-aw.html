  <title>We, the Survivors - Tash Aw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Harmony Silk Factory&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Five Star Billionaire&lt;/i&gt;, a compelling depiction of a man&#39;s act of violence, set against the backdrop of Asia in flux&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah Hock is an ordinary man of simple means. Born and raised in a Malaysian fishing village, he favors stability above all, a preference at odds with his rapidly modernizing surroundings. So what brings him to kill a man? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question leads a young, privileged journalist to Ah Hock&#39;s door. While the victim has been mourned and the killer has served time for the crime, Ah Hock&#39;s motive remains unclear, even to himself. His vivid confession unfurls over extensive interviews with the journalist, herself a local whose life has taken a very different course. The process forces both the speaker and his listener to reckon with systems of power, race, and class in a place where success is promised to all yet delivered only to its lucky heirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An uncompromising portrait of an outsider navigating a society in transition, Tash Aw&#39;s anti-nostalgic tale, &lt;i&gt;We, the Survivors&lt;/i&gt;, holds its tension to the very end. In the wake of loss and destruction, hope is among the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
