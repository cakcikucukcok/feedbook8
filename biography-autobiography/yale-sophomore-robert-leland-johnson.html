  <title>Yale Sophomore - Robert Leland Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YALEE&#39;S YOUTH REVISITED&lt;br&gt;New Book about a Man&#39;s Extraordinary Sophomore Year at Yale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denver, CO (Release Date TBD)  This is not his autobiography. Robert Leland Johnson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Yale Sophomore&lt;/i&gt; is a manuscript from the early fifties  told from the voice of the author in his youth. Johnson&#39;s compelling diary of the period of his life between 1952 and 1953, written at that same time, unearths the thoughts of his youth  a memoir of his resplendent days as a Yalee.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yale Sophomore&lt;/i&gt; was written along the lines of the exposition of Francois Sagan in &lt;i&gt;Bonjour Tristasse&lt;/i&gt;  in diary form. It is the perfect preservation of a young man&#39;s thoughts as he traverses the path of life, in a period of great uncertainty while he is still walking in errant wonder. It has a universal theme and appeals to youths of different backgrounds. It speaks of the vulnerability of youth and the promise that it undeniably holds.&lt;p&gt;The book was originally written with the intent of being published early on, but Johnson, being a renowned trial lawyer, withheld exposing his vulnerable emotions until such time when he was retired. A narrative of accomplishment, inner development, and also a brief history of the author&#39;s lineage, &lt;i&gt;Yale Sophomore&lt;/i&gt; is as charming as it gets. Reading it is like discovering a souvenir, a cherished memento, or breezing through a moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
