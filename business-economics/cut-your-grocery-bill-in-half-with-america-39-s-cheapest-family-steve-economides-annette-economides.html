Sound too good to be true? For the Economides family, it’s a reality, and it can be yours too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What could the average family do with an extra $3,000 a year? America’s Cheapest Family® shows you strategies, tips, tools, and tricks in &lt;i&gt;Cut Your Grocery Bill in Half&lt;/i&gt;, so you can achieve huge savings year after year. It’s a fact, the Economides say, saving money on groceries is one of the quickest ways to start making a positive difference in your family’s financial future.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And these tips and strategies can work whether you’re shopping for seven or for one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spend less time shopping and cooking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get more bang for your grocery buck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plan meals for picky eaters and busy schedules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discover kitchen tools that streamline meal preparations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn many ways to eat out or eat in and save big&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn your freezer into a money-making machine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endorsements:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many people think that it&#39;s impossible to reduce your grocery bill by 50%. But you can. Steve and Annette Economides provide step-by-step instructions in &quot;Cut Your Grocery Bill in Half.&quot; Tools that are practical and easy to follow. No special shopping or cooking skills required. Anyone can see a surprising reduction in their grocery budget if they follow the Economides&#39; methods. And, best of all, the savings begin right away. You don&#39;t need to finish the whole book to benefit. You&#39;ll find money-saving ideas that you can put to use in the first chapter, and every chapter thereafter. Normally I advise people to check books out of the library and save the cost of the book. But this is one do-it-yourself guide to lower grocery bills that you&#39;ll want to have on your bookshelf or kitchen countertop.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Gary Foreman, Publisher, The DollarStretcher.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “If you are eager to save on groceries, but don&#39;t always have the time to clip coupons, this book is for you! It’s perfect if you&#39;re interested in more ways to cut costs, reduce waste, and get organized. This is an awesome book for the novice or the skilled cook.”&lt;br&gt;Tawra Kellam and Jill Cooper—editors of LivingOnADime.com and authors of “Dining On A Dime Cookbook”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “I&#39;ve known Steve and Annette for several years and they definitely live what they believe. If you&#39;re serious about spending less money at the grocery store, this book offers some practical ways to achieve your goal. When it comes to stretching your dollar, I know of no one with more experience than Steve and Annette.”&lt;br&gt;JJ Heller—Singer/Songwriter &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
