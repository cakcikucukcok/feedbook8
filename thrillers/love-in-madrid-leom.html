      <meta name="description" content="Everything starts up in Madrid, where constant thoughts torment the mind of a man, taking him to plan with insatiable thirst the death of his wife. Josefa Isabel Martnez a woman of Colombian origin, who is deeply in love with her husband. She has suffered through the years the rage that comes out of the unfounded jealousy of her husband, but this anger has never reached the extreme. Josefa is an honest woman, and thanks to this,she frequently avoids her husbands brutality. But she does not imagine that the love that she feels for him will be her weakness, because, beyond the appearances, her husband drags a previous felony that he has maneuvered to keep in secrecy. 
The story has wings in Colombia as well, where Laura, Josefas sister, a beautiful nurse just started a beautiful love story with Juan, doctor and colleague at the same hospital where she works. They live together in a small town that is affected by the wars between the armed forces and guerillas in Colombia. When she lost her beloved in a terrible situation, Laura had no more remedy that resign to everything that she had sometime created with Juan and look for refuge with her loved sister Isabel in Madrid. 
During her journey from her town to the borderline, Laura meets asculptor, Sebastian, young, famous and wealthy, son of a politician deceased some years ago. Laura finds herself in a position where she hasto live in his house for some days. Sebastian falls crazily in love with beautiful Laura, but she decides to continue her trip and join her sister in Madrid because she feels that after the loss of her husband, her heart is not ready for a new love. 
After numerous difficulties and with the help of a close friend, Laura arrives to Spain and starts looking for her sisters address. While this occurs, in a hotel in Paris, four journalists that are part of an international association based in Berlin are running an investigation to select the European country with the highest social problems. One of the journalists of Albanian origin, a married man in his forties, is selected to visit Spain. 
When he arrives in Madrid, the journalist confronts the biggest surprise of his career and is right there when he meets Laura. 
For circumstances out of reach for both of them and due to an unpredictable coexistence, they fall in love, but neither one dares to admit it. Since both of them enjoy and suffer enjoying at the same time the love among them, this reaches the point in which their relationship becomes such a passionate love that only happens one night, but it is such a deep love that only has been seen a few times by humankind." />
