I was initially drawn to this book because of the high-profile artists who worked on it, including Colleen Doran, creator of A Distant Soil, and one of the original artists on The Sandman, Mike Dringenburg.<br /><b><i>Lord George Herbert's a Night in a Moorish Harem: Baisden ...</i></b> | A Night in a Moorish Harem is an erotic novella written by "Lord George Herbert" at some time around 1900. It recounts a night spent by a shipwrecked British sailor in a Moroccan harem with nine concubines of different nationalities. The harem topos is a typical example of the privileged location and also an example of Western literary orientalism.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Night In A Moorish Harem - Lord George Herbert</a> </h3></p><hr/>
