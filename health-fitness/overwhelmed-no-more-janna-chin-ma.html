  <title>Overwhelmed No More! - Janna Chin Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, &#39;Superwomen&#39; entrepreneurs from all over the country have come to Janna Chin, due to juggling many roles and responsibilities. During that time, Janna discovered that despite their personal circumstances, smart women entrepreneurs share the same experiences of stress, anxiety, and lack of confidence. These women had lost their energy, health, peace of mind, and even wealth. They discovered the good news that by shifting their mindset and using the right tools, it was truly possible to break-free from being overwhelmed and love themselves to wealth, with more ease and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Overwhelmed No More! Love Yourself to Wealth, Janna offers not only the sweet possibilities of what life without overwhelm can be, but she also provides you with the roadmap and tools you need to powerfully step out of overwhelm and break-free from the patterns and fears that have held you back from being the best version of yourself and creating the life and business you really want. This effective book is brimming with empowering women&#39;s poetry, exercises, and power affirmations to guide you to unlock the answers you&#39;re seeking to create profound change and transformation. Each poem takes you through a process of self-evaluation and introspection. The exercises and heart questions assist you with discovering powerful insights into what may be underlying your personal blocks, and provides you with the tools you can use to break-free from overwhelm and shift your money mindset; transforming your relationships and business to a life filled with ease, joy, and financial abundance!&lt;/p&gt;" />
