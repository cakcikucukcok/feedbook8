          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s got something he wants–his land. And something he doesn&#39;t know he has–his son!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Claire Worth inherits Pine Cliff–a resort on Lake Superior–from her late sister, Claire also get guardianship of her five-year-old twin nieces and her fourteen-year-old nephew. The resort she can manage; motherhood is something else again–especially when her sister&#39;s first husband shows up with plans of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since Logan Matthews lost Pine Cliff, his familiy&#39;s home, in a bitter divorce, he&#39;s had nothing to do with his ex-wife or her new family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Logan wants the place back. And now he has the means to fight for what&#39;s his. But he&#39;s becoming more and more attracted to Claire. He loves the warmth and laughter she and the children bring to Pine Cliff. And there&#39;s something about Claire&#39;s nephew that reminds Logan of himself at that age.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, there&#39;s a whole lot more at stake….&lt;/p&gt;
