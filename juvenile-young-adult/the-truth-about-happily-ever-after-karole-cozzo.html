  <title>The Truth About Happily Ever After - Karole Cozzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love doesn&#39;t always work out the way fairy tales tell us it should in this sweet romance about learning how to move on from a broken heart. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was supposed to be perfect. Alyssa has a job she loves, working as Cinderella at her favorite theme park; a fantastic group of friends; and a boyfriend who will no longer be long-distance. But as the summer progresses, her prince becomes less charming and more distant, and Alyssa&#39;s perfect summer falls apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced to acknowledge that life is not always a fairy tale, Alyssa starts working to pull her herself back together. Fortunately, she doesn&#39;t have to do it alone. With her friend Miller&#39;s support, she&#39;s determined to prove that she&#39;s more than just a pretty princess. And with his help, maybe she&#39;s finally ready for something better than dreams... Maybe she&#39;s ready for something real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Karole Cozzo, author of &lt;i&gt;How to Keep Rolling After a Fall&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;How to Say I Love You Out Loud&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;The Truth About Happily Ever After&lt;/i&gt;, a charming, uplifting young adult novel for the princess in all of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Karole Cozzo:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A &lt;b&gt;budding romance&lt;/b&gt; with family drama and&lt;b&gt; a feel-good ending&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;How to Say I Love You Out Loud&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A &lt;b&gt;wonderful, heartbreaking&lt;/b&gt; book which will stay with you.&quot; --Danika Stone, author of&lt;i&gt; All the Feels&lt;/i&gt;, on&lt;i&gt; How to Keep Rolling After a Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
