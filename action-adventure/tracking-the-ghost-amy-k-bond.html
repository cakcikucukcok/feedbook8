  <title>Tracking the Ghost - Amy K. Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s possible to slay your demons, but first you must hunt them down &lt;/p&gt;
Capt. Elliott Townsend is kidnapped. His wife Nevada, struggles to cope as grief reopens wounds in her heart, sinking her beneath the level of despair.&lt;/p&gt;
Joost Facade, Elliott&#39;s partner in past smuggling operations (&lt;I&gt;The Soul Seekers&lt;/I&gt;), where Elliott received his legendary title of &quot;Ghost&quot;, vows to find him. Together, they&#39;re &lt;I&gt;Tracking the Ghost&lt;/I&gt; into Central Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
Prison Chaplain, Will McCormick and fiance Brin Alexander (&lt;I&gt;Acts of Mercy&lt;/I&gt;), are close behind but trouble beseeches them. Soon, they are running for their lives through Africa&#39;s merciless outback.&lt;/p&gt;
At home, Governor Ben and First Lady Bethany McCormick (&lt;I&gt;Acts of Mercy&lt;/I&gt;), mysteriously disappear. Clues point to murder but somewhere hidden among the Okanogan Mountain range, the Governor and his wife are in hiding, preparing an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
In her signature design of interrelated, multiple plots, Amy K. Bond has created another action packed adventure, for the fiction reader. Returning the same loveable characters first introduced in &lt;I&gt;The Soul Seekers&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Acts Of Mercy&lt;/I&gt; plus a host of new personalities to complete the saga, you&#39;ll be reaching for &lt;I&gt;Tracking the Ghost&lt;/I&gt; at every opportunity to find out what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;" />
