  <title>Timecraft - Kelly Don Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The crack in the proverbial egg
is about to bust open. One of the worlds most primordial enigmas is soon to be
revealed. It is an object of timeless proportions. This mysterious adventure
begins in the life of a young boy who discovers the location of a treasure
worth more by far than any pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. As he grows
up he wonders if its not just the mad ramblings of his grandfathers legacy.
He deciphers the code and finds a sentient device that can show him all facets
of any moment in time. Not a time machine but something far more profound, he
views prehistory before Eden up to now and beyond as well as his eventful last
day. The secrets it exposes and the event horizons it displays go beyond the
distant reaches of space and time as we find the essence of truth imbedded in a
fictional account. Its amazing revelations and significant implications can
help mankind forge ahead into the unsettled future. We uncover among other
things who the ETs really are, their leader and followers, as well as their
purpose here on earth. Many other historical facts are not as they appear to be
and we find blatant unexpected flaws in our most advanced sciences and
theology. As he matures and handles this awesome responsibility, it transports
us on an epoch journey we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The setting of the book takes
place in a quaint little town in Texas between Brownwood and Cisco. It
traverses back and forth from there to &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Dallas&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;
with pivotal moments in &lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;Seoul&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region&gt;Korea&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.
The main characters name is cloaked to protect his true identity.&lt;/p&gt;
