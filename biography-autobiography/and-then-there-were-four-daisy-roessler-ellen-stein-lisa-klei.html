  <title>~And Then There Were Four - Daisy Roessler, Ellen Stein, Lisa Klei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was born when we four-childhood friends from our school days-realized that each of us had different
and unique memories of growing up in pre-Holocaust Berlin.
We wanted to share these stories not only with our families
and friends, but with others.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In so doing, we honor our parents and acknowledge
the distinctive ways in which they coped with overwhelming
circumstances. Their efforts and their courage made it
possible for us to survive.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We also remember our sometimes miraculous
escapes, our subsequent adventures, and the challenges
of adapting to a new culture and a foreign language.
We even discovered occasional joy in the process.
We cherish our lasting friendship and look forward to what
the future still has to offer.
