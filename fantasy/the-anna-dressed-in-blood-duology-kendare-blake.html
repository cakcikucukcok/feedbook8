  <title>The Anna Dressed in Blood Duology - Kendare Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This discounted ebundle includes: &lt;i&gt;Anna Dressed in Blood, Girl of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Anna Dressed in Blood&lt;/i&gt; is a dark and intricate tale, with a hero who kills the dead but is half in love with death himself. By the end of the book, you will be too. Spellbinding and romantic.&quot;--Cassandra Clare, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Mortal Instruments series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anna Dressed in Blood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So did his father before him, until he was gruesomely murdered by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father&#39;s mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. Together they follow legends and local lore, trying to keep up with the murderous dead--keeping pesky things like the future and friends at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Girl of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been months since the ghost of Anna Korlov opened a door to Hell in her basement and disappeared into it, but ghost-hunter Cas Lowood can&#39;t move on. He doesn&#39;t know what happened to Anna when she disappeared into Hell, but he knows she doesn&#39;t deserve whatever is happening to her now. Anna saved Cas more than once, and it&#39;s time for him to return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Tor books by Kendare Blake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Goddess War Trilogy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Antigoddess&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mortal Gods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ungodly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
