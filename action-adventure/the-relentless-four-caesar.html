  <title>The Relentless Four - Caesar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Avacks are pushed back, and their city, Carthage, is sacked and under the control of the most powerful force in earths history, the Visigoths. There seems to be no hope for the Avacks, whose pride and courage are essential to their way of life. Their only hope is in their determined leader, Avander, whose faith and stamina lead his people through the darkest and most foreboding time in their history. 
Cruel and unethical in their way of dealing, the Visigoths are led by their ruthless mastermind, Rickrage, who determines within himself to crush the Avackians in one swift military blow. His men are ready, and he sneaks his spies in every direction to bring down his enemy faster than he anticipates. But there is one problem for Rickrage; he underestimates the Avacks pride and love for freedom, which they would defend to the utmost. 
But as the Avacks prepare once more to rise to the occasion, they are sabotaged by hidden forces, known as the Relentless Four, who they are completely unaware of until it is almost too late. To make matters worse, one of their own in the court of the king is a lethal member of the Relentless Four, and he is divulging top-security information to the barbaric Visigoths. His love for money drives him to the point of selling his own race for gain, and his punishment at the end is severe. 
Read how two nations battle for the upper hand. Will the Avacks prevail and gain back Carthage, or will the Visigoths stamp them off the face of the earth?" />
