&lt;p&gt;Kalle: The timid sister who morphs into the strong family matriarch.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fletcher: The brilliant attorney who would give up everything for family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phyllis: The ultimate trophy wife  a sophisticated beauty, social leader and trend setter with a secret powerful enough to destroy her marriage, position in the community, and prevent her from giving her husband the family he wants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon: The handsome player who avoids relationships until a beautiful young woman stumbles into his life like a wounded doe. He nurtures her back to health, and watches her transformation into the self-assured Cinnamon unaware that she is capturing his heart in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance: The handsome Lothario with a dark side that brings pain and tragedy into the Woodbridge family, separating sister from sister and Mother from children. Just when the family begins to heal, he returns like a dark cloud, hovering over their lives, waiting to reign terror once again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
