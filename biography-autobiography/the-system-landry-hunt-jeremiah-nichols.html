  <title>The System - Landry Hunt, Jeremiah Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Billy Inlauv is a Data Tek Specialist with the CIA, in 2021 the FAI Functional Artificial Intelligence Systems, built by IBM, are in use by the government which allow everyone many various ways of making money. The U.S. Economy is thriving as we overtake the World in DGDP, Daily GDP, as everyone collects their earnings each day at midnight. There are 18 Sci-Fi short stories using their inventions in great suspenseful, some hilarious, romantic, and dramatic Science Fiction which to Jeremiah and Landry is not really Fiction, because if they had the money they could start the R&amp;D to build these products today. These stories are unlike any Sci-Fi youve ever seen and they all hit close to home with their vision of the future. 
Some of the Sci-Fi storylines include the use of SHIFT products, Synergistic Holos Interactive Forcefield Tek, all of which can be programmed to be 7k ft skyscrapers, skycars, houses, holos theater entertainment, and much more. Healing Rooms make death itself obsolete, the Earth Ring structure adds to the world population in a utopic society, the Automated Interstate and Road Systems make personal cars obsolete, the Hyperloop allows short time travel to any destination on the planet, the PAST makes all physical travel obsolete, genetics make the BioMechanical-NanoPharmaceutical products obsolete, DFWs and NIR knives are Non-Lethal Tek making death almost impossible.
