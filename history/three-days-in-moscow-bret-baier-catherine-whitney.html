  <title>Three Days in Moscow - Bret Baier, Catherine Whitney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the perfect gift for Dad this Father&#39;s Day: President Reagan&#39;s&amp;#160;dramatic battle to win the Cold War is revealed as never before&amp;#160;by the #1 bestselling author and award-winning anchor of the #1 rated &lt;em&gt;Special Report with Bret Baier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An instant classic, if not&amp;#160;the finest book to date on Ronald Reagan.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Jay Winik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moscow, 1988: 1,000 miles behind the Iron Curtain, Ronald Reagan stood for freedom and confronted the Soviet empire.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his acclaimed bestseller &lt;em&gt;Three Days in January&lt;/em&gt;, Bret Baier illuminated the extraordinary leadership of President Dwight Eisenhower at the dawn of the Cold War. Now in his highly anticipated new history, &lt;em&gt;Three Days in Moscow&lt;/em&gt;, Baier explores the dramatic endgame of America&amp;#8217;s long struggle with the Soviet Union and President Ronald Reagan&amp;#8217;s central role in shaping the world we live in today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 31, 1988, Reagan stood on Russian soil and addressed a packed audience at Moscow State University, delivering a remarkable&amp;#8212;yet now largely forgotten&amp;#8212;speech that capped his first visit to the Soviet capital. This fourth in a series of summits between Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, was a dramatic coda to their tireless efforts to reduce the nuclear threat. More than that, Reagan viewed it as &amp;#8220;a grand historical moment&amp;#8221;: an opportunity to light a path for the Soviet people&amp;#8212;toward freedom, human rights, and a future he told them they could embrace if they chose. It was the first time an American president&amp;#160;had given an address about&amp;#160;human rights on Russian soil. Reagan had once called the Soviet Union an &amp;#8220;evil empire.&amp;#8221; Now, saying that depiction was from &amp;#8220;another time,&amp;#8221; he beckoned the Soviets to join him in a new vision of the future. The importance of Reagan&amp;#8217;s Moscow speech was largely overlooked at the time, but the new world he spoke of was fast approaching; the following year, in November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, leaving the United States the sole superpower on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the end of the Cold War is perhaps the defining historical moment of the past half century, and must be understood if we are to make sense of America&amp;#8217;s current place in the world, amid the re-emergence of US-Russian tensions during Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s tenure. Using Reagan&amp;#8217;s three days in Moscow to tell the larger story of the president&amp;#8217;s critical and often misunderstood role in orchestrating a successful, peaceful ending to the Cold War, Baier illuminates the character of one of our nation&amp;#8217;s most venerated leaders&amp;#8212;and reveals the unique qualities that allowed him to succeed in forming an alliance for peace with the Soviet Union, when his predecessors had fallen short.&lt;/p&gt;" />
