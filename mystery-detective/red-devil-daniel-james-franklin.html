  <title>Red Devil - Daniel James Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Tanner has lost it all. His wife is sleeping around, he is newly unemployed, and worst of all, he just lost his daughter to the great beyond. He has no purpose and nothing to live foror so the voices tell him. The Red Devils hide the pain, but the pills are quickly turning against him.Voices chant of his demise. Theyre telling him to use the gun in his hand and end it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben wanders the night in search for answers while the Red Devils burn his world into a twisted fantasy of good and evil. As the night progresses the Red Devils release their poison and Bens mind swells with pain and anger. The revolver in his hand pulses with a  wicked energy. By the end of the darkness, he may just use the gun on himself. At least it would make the voices stop; it would make the pain stop, too. How had it come to this? Why had he become the victim of so many pointless misfortunes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tanner is not alone. He is being chased by a gang of dark and vicious characters who wish him harm, but there are others-those who mean him well. They stand beside him and battle for his broken soul before the Red Devils take over and it is too late. Follow Benjamin Tanner as he desperately searches for meaning in the emptiness and takes a final stand against his pain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
