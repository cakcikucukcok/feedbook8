  <title>My Mom&#39;s A What? - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elle has been an escort for years. But when her son finds out the truth, they both find themselves in uncharted territory. Andy wants to turn the tables on his gorgeous mom. But his plan to confront her backfires. She had indulged other men&amp;#39;s fantasies for years. What will happen when her son can fulfill the most taboo fantasy of all?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just once.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sound of her voice died, swallowed up by the silence that fell over the room. Emma held her breath, watching her son wage his own internal war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why should it be so hard? I&amp;#39;m here. I&amp;#39;m attractive. He&amp;#39;s here. He&amp;#39;s attractive. We&amp;#39;re both horny. What is he waiting for?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, her son hadn&amp;#39;t had the benefit of twenty years as a sex worker stripping away the polite lies that society told itself. If life had taught her anything, it had taught her that no matter how much people liked to pretend that they were all normal,&amp;#39; when the shades came down and the lights were turned off, a huge chunk of sexually active people were all depraved perverts. It didn&amp;#39;t take much prodding for them to indulge in their darkest fantasies. A man who littered his Facebook page with quotes from the bible could secretly crave the gay sex his faith and his own internal hang-ups denied him, while a woman who would never dream of admitting it in public might hunger for Emma to strap on a strap-on and spank her while she took her from behind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just once?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She blinked and met Andy&amp;#39;s eyes. They were wide and vulnerable, and she couldn&amp;#39;t quite identify the emotion that dwelled there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If that&amp;#39;s all you can give me, then just once is just fine, baby.&amp;quot; She let a corner of her mouth curl up. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s one more than I ever thought I&amp;#39;d get. And if you say the word, I&amp;#39;ll never mention it again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; she continued, letting her hand roam from his shoulder to his hip and up the inside of his thigh as his breath caught, his skin rising in gooseflesh as she teased him, &amp;quot;if you decide that once isn&amp;#39;t enough...&amp;quot;" />
