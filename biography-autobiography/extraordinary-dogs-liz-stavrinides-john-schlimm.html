      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A beautiful photo book showcasing more than 50 heroic dogs &quot;in uniform&quot; and their stories, from photographer Liz Stavrinides and author John Schlimm.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extraordinary Dogs&lt;/i&gt; portrays more than fifty working dogs, along with the police officers, firefighters, veterans, and other trained volunteer handlers who serve side-by-side with them. Their moving stories and beautiful photographs are an unprecedented glimpse at Comfort Dogs and Search and Rescue Dogs, along with bomb-detecting TSA dogs and canine ambassadors from across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The stories of the Lutheran Church Charities K-9 Comfort Dogs take readers behind the scenes of their headlining deployments--such as the Boston Marathon bombing, Superstorm Sandy, and the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.&lt;br&gt;* Search and Rescue K-9 teams reveal what it&#39;s really like to travel into the eye of natural disasters, accidents, crime scenes, and the worst terrorist strike in recorded history. &lt;br&gt;* At Washington Dulles International Airport, readers meet several of the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s TSA dogs whose sole job it is to keep the flying public safe from explosives and other dangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extraordinary Dogs &lt;/i&gt;is both a portrait of what love, hope, courage, and heroism look like in their purest forms and a tribute to the eternal and impactful bonds we forge with our furry friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
