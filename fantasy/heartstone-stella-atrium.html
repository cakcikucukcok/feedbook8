  <title>Heartstone - Stella Atrium</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The second installment of Atriums Dolvia Saga is a character-driven sci-fi tale that explores profoundand timelythemes of sexual oppression, environmentalism and cultural intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atriums intricate novel ranges widely in themegender, politics, existential philosophy, mysticism, etc. Set primarily on the planet of Dolviawhere the females of the indigenous, frequently warring tribes of the savannah maintain few rights and are forced to wear burkas the storyline revolves, at least initially, around Dr. Edna Edwina Greensboro, a bush-clinic doctor whose courage, compassion and vision have begun to change some of the insular ways of thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting married to Lt. Mike Shaw, an off -world military man, and keeping two female gualarepsoversized and sentient iguana-esque reptilesincreases her status. But when she witnesses a mixed blood girl being brutally abused, she realizes that shes working against centuries of oppression reinforced by cultural mores, folklore, myth and cruel men dead set on guarding the status quo. After all, the victims are only women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentary on gender politics benefits from a foreign setting; its an exercise in considering discrimination without finger-pointing. But thats only one aspect of this multifaceted story as Greensboro fights to save lives and educate the tribes people, nefarious individuals and companies seek to profit from the chaos  Atriums saga continues with another entertaining and powerful read, reminiscent of Octavia E. Butler and Margaret Atwood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An allegorical, emotionally intimate narrative for sci-fi fans, with broad themes that could appeal to a mainstream audience, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
