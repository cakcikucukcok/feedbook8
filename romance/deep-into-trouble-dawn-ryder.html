  <title>Deep Into Trouble - Dawn Ryder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Desire is more dangerous than anything in Deep Into Trouble, the next Unbroken Heroes novel from Dawn Ryder.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saxon Hale lives for the hunt--taking down the bad guys, stopping them dead in their tracks. His latest mission has him in New Orleans, where people go for the party that never ends. But fun is the last thing on Saxon&#39;s mind now that he&#39;s a breath away from closing in on a vicious overlord known only as the Raven. Until an innocent young woman unknowingly enters the very deadly game...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger Boyce is a librarian who&#39;s growing tired of being so buttoned-up on the job, and when she attends a conference in the Big Easy, she decides to taste the wild side of life. But when her dance with darkness becomes lethal, she&#39;s in dire need of protection--and ends up in the embrace of a man who radiates danger and desire. Soon Saxon finds himself Ginger&#39;s shield against an enemy whose power they haven&#39;t yet begun to face. But will he be able to keep his mind on his mission while the very woman under his care drives him beyond distraction?&lt;/p&gt;" />
