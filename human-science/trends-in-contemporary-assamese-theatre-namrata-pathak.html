  <title>Trends in Contemporary Assamese Theatre - Namrata Pathak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the very nature of representation to be theatrical and self-referential. This book undercuts the fact that all representational knowledge is autonomous and sovereign. At times, theatrical representations can misguide and mislead. Representation can also ineluctably project ones own preferences and preoccupations. Thus, representation and subjective interpretation divulge into myriad domains. This book is concerned with the effects and consequences of representation and its politics. This book examines not only how language as well as representation produce meaning, but also how discursive knowledge connected to power regulates, conducts, and constructs identities and defines the way certain things are thought about practices and are studied. The book takes note of the fact that within the framework of performance, a performative subject does not wear a coherent identity as it is  fragmented, decentered, simulated and is unstable, while being both virtual as well as actual. In the field of semiotics, theatre is historically and reciprocally affected by practice, especially within contingent conditions of time. In theatre semiotics, the new image of knowledge is that of turbulence. Here, knowledge is not so much a system as it is a confluence. Carrying this stance further we can say that contemporary Assamese theatre is characterised by shifting counter-voices and sub-textual underpinnings. This act forces reading into two directions: dialogic openness and variability of meaning that question the theatre directors as the only ones who know." />
