  <title>Folie a Deux - Jessika Malo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If God has created Adam for his own entertainment, and Eve for Adams, then what did Eve design for her own entertainment, and what means does she create for that sake? Why does she excuse the act of stepping on her shadow, is she really this resilient on forgiveness or does she have a hidden agenda lurking behind? Who returned the balance to the equator of the world, and what elements constantly revive the madness of love?! 
The unusual love shared by these very ordinary characters reverts into madness as it succumbs the world to them and them to the ancient world, will they constantly be revived by this beautiful sense of madness, or will they become memories, voicing a love echoed by each and every cell of their being, magnified by the touches of the hands of wind, tainted by fear and thoughts of independence into inhalation, if it ever exists in love and madness?!&lt;p&gt;
