  <title>10 Decisions I Could Have Made Better than God: And Other Audacious Atheist Articles - Jon Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if someone told you that they had come up with 10 alternatives to some of God&#39;s decisions that were more efficient, caused less harm, and in general, were more loving than the 10 decisions God had supposedly made? What if you were told that you could too? In this book, that topic is covered as the author provides entertaining analysis, satire, and criticism of a so-called perfect book while making fun of religion in a way that would make even the most fervent religious zealot laugh.   As for the cover. Yes. You read that correctly. David Mills, the author of Atheist Universe said of this book &quot;This is the greatest thing I have ever seen.&quot; Other feedback on many other articles contained within the pages of this book include &quot;This is gold.&quot; &quot;Love love love this!&quot; &quot;Brilliant!&quot; &quot;Wow... just wow!&quot; &quot;Thank you for that! I never thought of it that way!&quot; &quot;Clever.&quot; &quot;Very interesting!&quot; &quot;Wow. I have read the Bible, and never looked at it like that before.&quot; &quot;Very insightful!&quot; &quot;This is amazing. I read it like 4 times. Love at first sight.&quot; &quot;Oh, that is good.&quot; &quot;Genius!&quot; How will you react to this book? Flip through the first few pages and see for yourself. Note: If you are viewing this book online, there should be a preview function you can use to check it out.   As far as the content is concerned, this book has everything: atheist satire (one of which is entitled Joel Osteen Hospitalized After Smiling So Big He Broke His Face), atheist poetry (including a tribute to Christopher Hitchens entitled Tonight I Drink Johnnie Walker Black), critiques of Christian films such as God&#39;s Not Dead, Left Behind, Persecuted, and Kirk Cameron&#39;s Saving Christmas. Included in this work are four passages that each won first place in an atheist quote submission contest. There were around 60 competing entries total in each competition. In this book you will find interviews with prominent atheists such as Camels with Hammers&#39; Philosopher Dr. Daniel Fincke and the founder of Global Secular Humanist Movement, Faisal Saeed Al Mutar as well as a song about the ineptitude of Ray Comfort entitled &quot;Google that  Shit!&quot; What more could you ask for? Buy one for yourself. Buy one for a friend. Hell, buy a whole bunch and stock hotel rooms with them like the Gideons do with the Bible.   Jon is also the author of three other books as well. Nothing Sacred: An Atheist Quote-A-Day Calendar, Blasphemy: Atheist Quotes and Essays By An Apostate, and Unreal News: A Collection of Satire can be purchased through FastPencil.com. Jon has written for Guardian Liberty Voice, Unreal News Online, and wrote for four and a half years for the Modesto Atheism Examiner. He has been featured on and interviewed by The Pink Atheist, Freethought Forum, Atheist Analysis, and Reason TV.  He has a Bachelor of Science in Theatre and Communication Arts and is working on a Masters Degree in Applied Psychology. Jon hopes you get as much enjoyment out of reading this book as he did writing it." />
