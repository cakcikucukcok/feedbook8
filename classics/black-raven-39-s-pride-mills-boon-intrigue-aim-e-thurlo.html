        &lt;p&gt;Eden Maes came back to the Native American pueblo to clear her family&#39;s name for the sake of her baby boy. What she found was danger&amp;#133land only one strong helping hand.&lt;/p&gt;

But as the father of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; child…. Would he remain a slave to his badge or could the call of family claim his heart forever?&lt;/p&gt;
