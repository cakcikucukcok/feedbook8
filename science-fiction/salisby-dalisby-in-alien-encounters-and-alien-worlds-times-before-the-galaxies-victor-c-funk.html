  <title>Salisby Dalisby in Alien Encounters and Alien Worlds: Times Before the Galaxies - Victor C. Funk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Salisby Dalisby for many millennia had been living a very peaceful happy life with only his Sanctiant families. This is a world of magical orders that had been the norm for all of the Sanctiant families for millions of years. Salisby had been lucky in the past if each of his Sanctiant family situations lasted longer than a century. Sooner than later a dark crime Lord with his business group would come into the same location then once again disrupt Salisby Dalisby and other family members from their current happy family experience by using again their dark cloaking technologies. The Novel series follows the space and time traveler Salisby Dalisby to many different places in the pre-galactic history of the Universe. Then follows Salisby through many different dimensions of time. The dark Kingpins using large spaceships had optimal access to several different cloaking times during their travel in the Universe. Most of the time many of the dark hateful business groups were going around stealing the Sanctiant families riches while promoting their own groups propaganda and plagiarism schemes with use of their advanced technologies. All the kind Sanctiant families have are their magical orders to protect themselves and their homes from unwanted attacks." />
