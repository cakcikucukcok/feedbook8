  <title>Living Life - Cole Noel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living Life is all Dana Austin wanted to do.  Finally in her groove as one of the most sought after consultants on juvenile cases in North Texas, Danas focus was food, fun, and fitness.  As she wrestled with her faith, Danas struggle with two lovers complicates her simple life amidst some unsuspecting circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As Dana deals with the concerns of loving a man who she doesnt trust and a man whose love overwhelms her, she is faced with the toughest battle of her life. Dana makes a fatal choice between Judge Derek Cartier, her other best friend and companion, and Lincoln Hollingsworth, her college love and returning soldier.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Her journey back to the living moves Dana to face her distant relatives, emotional hang-ups, and redeeming faith in herself and love. Believing that love and God have given up on her, Dana is reminded that there is hope to live life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
