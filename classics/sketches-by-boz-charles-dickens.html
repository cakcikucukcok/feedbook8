  <title>Sketches by Boz -  Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Sketches by Boz&amp;quot; is a collection of short pieces published by Charles Dickens (under the pseudonym Boz) in 1836.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The collection heralded an exciting new voice in English literature and it is Dickens first published book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This richly varied collection of observation, fancy and fiction shows the London he knew so intimately at its best and worst - its streets, theatres, inns, pawnshops, law courts, prisons, omnibuses and the river Thames - in honest and visionary descriptions of everyday life and people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sketches by Boz&amp;quot; is a remarkable achievement, and looks towards Dickens&amp;#39;s giant novels in its profusion of characters, its glimpses of surreal modernity and its limitless fund of pathos and comic invention." />
