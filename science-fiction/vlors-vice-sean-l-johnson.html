  <title>Vlors &amp; Vice - Sean L Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;VLORs &amp; VICE agencies (formerly known as VLORICE) are secretly funded by The Informant. This Informant stays in contact with both agencies in secrecy. The United States Military personnel, along with national security, counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism cases, and the successor organization to the former Naval Investigative Service (NIS), are all unaware of VLORs &amp; VICE operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VLORs is an espionage and law-enforcement type of agency. VLORs main goal is to protect and to never be seen. VICE is the opposite and strives for a new world order. VLORs investigates activities concerning crimes against The United States and from around the world, eventually will deal with para-normal and super-human threats. VLORs is ran by Commander Thomas Jeffery Addams, who was given the position by The Informant. Addams sends special agents out on missions. VICE is a criminal organization dedicated to the achievement of world domination through terrorist and subversive activities on various fronts, resulting in one, new ideal world order. VICEs base of operations is secretive and inconclusive; always attempting to elude VLORs, who always stops VICE. VICE is run by Commander Johnathan Walter Talgitx, who was a former General in the U.S. Army. Talgitx was given the position by The Informant. The two secret agencies operate on hidden ships that are unknown and never-seen-before. The ships are believed to be mobile.&lt;/p&gt;" />
