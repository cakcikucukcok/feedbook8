  <title>The Simulation - Phillip J. Watt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gary and Elle are out late, attempting to maintain their sense of youth. On their way back to the hotel after some drinking and dancing, they decide to stop at a game store to test out the latest virtual reality technology. Gary and Elle enter Meet Your Master to have a little innocent fun, but it all goes wrong when Garys consciousness gets lost in the game.
As he navigates through various perspectives of people he doesnt know, he becomes more and more confused about what is actually happening to him. Is he stuck in a game or lost in a dream? Or has he died back in the game shop?
Garys journey takes him through alternative pasts, presents, and futures. Some are fun, and others walk him to the edge of his sanity. Yet as challenging as the experience is for him, he soon realises he is learning, healing, and growing in incredible ways. But as he gets closer to finding out the ultimate truth, he is forced to confront who he really is and his entire conception of reality." />
