  <title>Eva Moves the Furniture - Margot Livesey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a highly acclaimed author-the enchanting, bittersweet story of a motherless young woman torn between real life and the otherwordly companions only she can see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning of Eva McEwen&#39;s birth, six magpies congregate in the apple tree outside the window-a bad omen, according to Scottish legend. That night Eva&#39;s mother dies, leaving her to be raised by her aunt and heartsick father in the small town of Troon, Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Eva is often visited by two companions: a woman and a girl. Invisible to everyone else, &lt;br&gt;they seem benevolent at first, helping her to tidy her room and collect the hens&#39; eggs. But as she grows older, their intentions become increasingly unclear: Do they wish to protect or harm her? Is their meddling in her best interest or prompted by darker motivations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shadow of World War II, Eva studies nursing in Glasgow, tending to the wounded soldiers. But when she falls in love with a young plastic surgeon, the companions seem to have a very different idea as to her fate, and once again she finds herself unable to resist their pull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A magical novel about loneliness, love, and the profound connection between mother and daughter, Eva Moves the Furniture fuses the simplicity of a fairy tale with the complexity of adult passions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
