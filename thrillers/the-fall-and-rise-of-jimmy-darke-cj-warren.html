  <title>The Fall and Rise of Jimmy Darke - Cj Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jimmy Darke was a serving police officer with the Northern Police Force, and in 2004, his dream of becoming a detective on the Northern Serious Crime Team became a reality. But, very quickly, he found that he did not like the way some of his colleagues worked, and he did not want to be part of it anymore. He wanted out.
This is when it all went wrong for him, and in a very short space of time, he was deliberately setup by two senior detectives on the team. This resulted in him going to prison for two years for a serious crime that he was not guilty of. The world of Jimmy Darke had fallen apart.
This book tells the story of how Jimmy Darke fought against all odds to prove his innocence and that is exactly what he did with the help of some friends that he had made along the way. Jimmy Darke rose once more." />
