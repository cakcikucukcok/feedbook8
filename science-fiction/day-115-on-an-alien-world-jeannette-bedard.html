  <title>Day 115 on an Alien World - Jeannette Bedard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A wormhole away from Earth, a planet square in the goldilocks zone was found - a perfect location for a new colony. Yet for the first colonists, this alien world is plagued by a saboteur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gary Holbrook signed on as the colony&amp;rsquo;s doctor, there was a catch - the mission was for married couples only. Without a suitable spouse, he reluctantly married Margo Murphy, a grubby entomologist with a fondness for butterflies. This morning Gary watched his wife die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crash of their colony ship was their introduction to their new world. Accident after accident claimed the lives of more and more colonists. Margo&amp;rsquo;s death seemed like just more of the same bad luck until Gary discovered she had found evidence of a saboteur in their midst. Her investigation exposed secret motives hidden from the colonists that would change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Gary must follow Margo&amp;rsquo;s clues to stop the saboteur before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
