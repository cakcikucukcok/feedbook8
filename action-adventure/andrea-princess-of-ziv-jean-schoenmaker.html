  <title>Andrea, Princess of Ziv - Jean Schoenmaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Andrea is a girl who still believes in the tooth fairy. When she is at home one rainy morning pouting because the tooth fairy left nothing under her pillow, her teddy bear tells her she is a princess in the Land of Be Alive and orders a half-conch shell to whisk her away to her princessdom. 
Fly with Andrea and go with her from depending on her adjutants for guidance to managing the affairs of the twelve spheres that orbit over her palace in Ziv and from believing in  a tooth fairy to believing in herself. 
Share the adventures of the Princess of all of Ziv and her twelve princesses-in-training who enjoy galas, coronation ceremonies, and opulent rooms in the palace and the  adventures of battling their fear of monsters, vampires, deep  oceans, and evil entities in one or another of her Zivoids. 
Love the way she talks to somewhat strange earth-like creatures, plants, and rocks and learns shape-shifting, size-reduction, and the art of being a princess in which she practices controlling her thoughts, sharing, kindness, and the joy of living." />
