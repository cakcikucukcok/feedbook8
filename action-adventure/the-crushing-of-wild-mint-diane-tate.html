  <title>The Crushing of Wild Mint - Diane Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Crushing of Wild Mint&lt;/i&gt; is a family saga told through daring adventure and sweet romance, a rags-to-riches story showing both the good and evil that go with having money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive seen money do incredibly good things, or in this case, it seems to have made us a target. The money meant nothing to Harrison. His only concern was his daughter. He would gladly pay the ransom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexter Hughes and Farley Briggs were hungry for more than food as they waited, watching the party from outside the Windham home. They were sick of running and sick of each other but would endure if it meant getting a lot of money. Now they were sizing up the people of the town, separating rich from poor. It was always good to know whom to threaten, who would pay, who could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step back in time and enjoy a relaxing summer in the small town of Caney.&lt;/p&gt;" />
