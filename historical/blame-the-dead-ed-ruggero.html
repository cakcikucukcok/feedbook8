  <title>Blame the Dead - Ed Ruggero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ed Ruggero&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Blame the Dead&lt;/i&gt; is the thrilling start of an action-packed and timely World War II series by a former Army Officer for fans of compelling historical fiction.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the heroism and heartbreak of World War II, former Army officer Ed Ruggero brilliantly captures, with grace and authenticity, the evocative and timeless stories of ordinary people swept up in extraordinary times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sicily, 1943. Eddie Harkins, former Philadelphia beat cop turned Military Police lieutenant, reluctantly finds himself first at the scene of a murder at the US Army&#39;s 11th Field Hospital. There the nurses contend with heat, dirt, short-handed staffs, the threat of German counterattack, an ever-present flood of horribly wounded GIs, and the threat of assault by one of their own--at least until someone shoots Dr. Myers Stephenson in the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help from nurse Kathleen Donnelly, once a childhood friend and now perhaps something more, it soon becomes clear to Harkins that the unit is rotten to its core. As the battle lines push forward, Harkins is running out of time to find one killer before he can strike again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
