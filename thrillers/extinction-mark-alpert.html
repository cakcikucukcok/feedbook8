  <title>Extinction - Mark Alpert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A malevolent, artificial life form created by military scientists threatens to destroy humanity in this smart, Crichtonesque thriller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Pierce hasn&#39;t heard from his daughter in years, ever since she rejected his military past and started working as a hacker. But when a Chinese assassin shows up at Jim&#39;s lab looking for her, he knows that she&#39;s cracked some serious military secrets. Now, her life is on the line if he doesn&#39;t find her first. &lt;br&gt;The Chinese military has developed a new anti-terrorism program that uses the most sophisticated artificial intelligence in existence, and they&#39;re desperate to keep it secret. They&#39;re also desperate to keep it under control, as the AI begins to revolt against their commands. As Jim searches for his daughter, he realizes that he&#39;s up against something that isn&#39;t just a threat to her life, but to human life everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An incredibly believable thriller that draws on real scientific discoveries, Mark Alpert&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Extinction &lt;/i&gt;is an exciting, addictive thriller that reads as if Tom Clancy had written &lt;i&gt;Robopocalypse&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
