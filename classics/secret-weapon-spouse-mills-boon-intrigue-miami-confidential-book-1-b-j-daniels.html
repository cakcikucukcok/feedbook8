        &lt;p&gt;WEDDING PLANNER UNDER COVER&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By day, quiet and reserved Samantha Peters worked for a high-end wedding planner. By night she was a top-notch agent with Miami Confidential. Then she met sexy Alex Graham after tragedy struck outside the Weddings Your Way salon, and Samantha had trouble keeping her two lives separate. Being with Alex brought out Samantha&#39;s protective instincts–and the wild side she tried so hard to keep hidden–when she and Alex became the targets of a dangerous enemy. Samantha had to remain focused, or jeopardize the work and the team. After all, forming attachments to victims was wrong…even if being with Alex felt so right….&lt;/p&gt;
