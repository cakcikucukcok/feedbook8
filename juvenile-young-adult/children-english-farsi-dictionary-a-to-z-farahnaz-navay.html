  <title>Children English / Farsi Dictionary a to Z - Farahnaz Navay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This children dictionary book is a combination of two languagesEnglish and Farsi.
Children dictionary like all other dictionaries is a book about words. It tells you what each word means and how each word spells. For each word in this book, a picture of the word exists. In addition, this book provides pronunciation of translated exact English word to Farsi word. Children dictionary book shows how to use each word in a sentence both in English and Farsi. 
At the end of this book, there is English alphabet and Farsi alphabet. However, that Farsi alphabet is like Arabic alphabet. (Farsi alphabet has four more letters of PEH, CH, ZH, GEH or . - - .) English language has twenty-six alphabets, and Farsi language has thirty-two alphabets. Writing direction in English is from left to right, but in Farsi is from right to left.
This children dictionary book shows spelling of the English and Farsi word and sentence and pronunciation of translated English word to the Farsi word. Also, I wrote the vowels of pronunciation of Farsi word in English. 
This children dictionary book is in ABC order. You can find a word that begins with A before a word that begins with B and a word that begins with B before a word that begins with C. There is a box of alphabet (AZ), which you can find each word according to the letter they begin with. For example, you can find the word airplane in the A section of the dictionary. Children dictionary gives the (1) spelling of a word, (2) meaning of a word, (3) picture of a word, and (4) pronunciation of a translated word from English to Farsi. 
Sometimes one word has more than one meaning, and only you can find the meaning of the word based on a given sentence. For example, shir has three different meanings in Farsi (lion, milk, and faucet). Pictures and meanings of these words are shown in children dictionary book.
Most pictures in this book are drawn by the author, others are used from first grade Farsi book in Iran, and some are from relatives who permitted their pictures to be used in the book. Also, there are few Internet pictures that are permitted to be used in this book." />
