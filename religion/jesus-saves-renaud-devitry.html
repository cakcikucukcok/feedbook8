  <title>Jesus Saves - Renaud deVitry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The bulk of this book was written over a 3-year period in India during daily quiet times there. It has been pared down from over 1,000 pages to 365 daily meditations corresponding to a daily reading through the Bible. The reading schedule is given at the head of each page with the days date. A verse is selected from each reading and includes the authors thoughts for that day with a catchy title and an anecdote at the end. Many good devotionals are available, but the author feels this format will aid readers in keeping the Bible relevant to their daily lives as they attempt the worthy task of reading through the entire Bible in a year. It speaks to many personal concerns as they are addressed in the pages of Scripture. It is the authors hope that this book will become a companion to daily Bible reading, and will encourage the readers to stick with their resolve to complete at least one year through the entire Bible." />
