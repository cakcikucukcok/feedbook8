  <title>Doing the Devil&#39;s Work - Bill Loehfelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gripping third chapter for one of the most unforgettable and compelling heroines in crime fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;You have a temper, Officer Coughlin, and a propensity for violence . . . You&#39;re a bit of a hazard. To others. To yourself.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maureen Coughlin is a bona fide New Orleans cop now, and, with her training days behind her, she likes to think she&#39;s getting the lay of the land. Then a mysterious corpse leads to more questions than answers, and a late-night traffic stop goes very wrong. The fallout leaves Maureen contending with troubled friends, fraying loyalties, cop-hating enemies old and new, and an elusive, spectral, and murderous new nemesis--and all the while navigating the twists and turns of a city and a police department infected with dysfunction and corruption.&lt;br&gt;     Bill Loehfelm is a rising star in crime fiction. And his Maureen Coughlin is the perfect protagonist: complicated, strong-willed, sympathetic (except when she&#39;s not), and as fully realized in Loehfelm&#39;s extraordinary portrayal as the New Orleans she patrols. The first two installments in this series won Loehfelm accolades as well as fans, and &lt;i&gt;Doing the Devil&#39;s Work&lt;/i&gt; only ups the ante. It&#39;s even faster, sharper, and more thrilling than its predecessors. Taut and fiery, vibrant and gritty, and peopled with unforgettable characters, this is the sinuous, provocative story of a good cop struggling painfully into her own.&lt;br&gt;ABA IndieNext Selection for January, 2015&lt;/p&gt;" />
