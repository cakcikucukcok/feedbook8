  <title>Hold Me Until Forever - Christina Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled&#39;s Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&#39;s the only one he wants...and the one he can never have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ella Clark has been in love with Alex Grayson forever. She&#39;s tired of being invisible--or worse, being treated like his kid sister. If she can just get him to drop his iron-fisted control for two seconds, she&#39;ll prove she knows exactly how to blow his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex has been fighting his attraction to Ella since her should-have-been-innocent sweet sixteen kiss burned down his world. He&#39;s damaged, and there&#39;s no way he&#39;ll ever drag her into his screwed up life. Until she offers him something he&#39;s always craved--steamy, no-strings sex inside his exclusive BDSM club. Where she&#39;ll be safe from the darkness that haunts him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except there&#39;s nothing safe about being with Ella, and the more she gives, the harder it is to let her go. If he stays, he risks everything, but how can he walk away from the only woman he&#39;s ever needed?&lt;/p&gt;" />
