  <title>Ghost Worship - Charles  Grant Allan </title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The  ghost in fact plays in the ideas of early man the same part that guano  and phosphates play today in the ideas of the educated scientific  farmer...  &lt;br/&gt;
Furthermore, another connection may be shown to exist  between plants or trees and ghosts. We know that it is a frequent  practice deliberately to put in herbs, shrubs, or trees on the graves of  the dead. How far back in history or in savage life this practice may  extend I am unfortunately not in a position to state. In Roman Catholic  countries, however, the planting of flowers on the graves of the dead  takes place usually on the jour des morts (all saints’ day), a custom  which would seem to argue for it an immense antiquity; for though it is  usual among Catholics to explain the jour des morts as a féte of  comparatively recent origin, definitely introduced by a particular saint  at a particular period, its analogy to similar celebrations elsewhere  shows that it is really a surviving relic of a very ancient form of  Manes worship. In Algeria, I observed, the Arab women went on Fridays to  plant flowers on the graves of their immediate dead; and the same point  is noted about the same place by Miss Seguin. The koubbas, or little  dome-shaped tombs of saints, so common throughout North Africa, are  almost always inclosed by a low stone wall, which marks off the temenos,  and are usually overshadowed by palm trees deliberately planted there...&lt;/span&gt;
