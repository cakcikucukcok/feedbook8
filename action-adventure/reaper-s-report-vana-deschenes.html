  <title>Reaper’S Report - Vana Deschenes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, a man is literally blown into a new existence as The Reaper. Ninety-nine years later, The Reaper is looking forward to retirement in a cabin on Lake Fish-a-Plenty. But first, he must get through his last day with Death Corporation, collecting the souls of twelve people who are not expecting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his final day on the job begins, The Reaper wonders if he will ever have the guts to ask out Debbie, from accounting. He is first presented with a golden scythe and then surprisingly given an interesting final assignmenta hostage crisis. By one oclock in the afternoon, The Reaper already knows a big event is going to impact many in the city. As events begin to go down at a local bank, he keeps himself busy by testing the waters with Debbie and collecting Daniel, a Yale recruit who suffers sunstroke, and Emmie, a circus performer who loses her life to a tiger attack. By the time the clock strikes midnight, an intense hostage situation has played out, The Reapers love life has been decided, and twelve souls have changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tongue-in-cheek tale, a grim reaper embarks on a wild ride through twelve final hours as a soul deliveryman.&lt;/p&gt;" />
