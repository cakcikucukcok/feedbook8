          &lt;strong&gt;The Notorious Mr Hurst (&lt;em&gt;Those Scandalous Ravenhursts&lt;/em&gt;, Book 5)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rumours abound that sensible Lady M– has fallen for the infamous Mr H– Lady Maude Templeton has turned down many a marriage proposal. Why? She wants to marry for love – and her heart’s set on one man alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Theatre owner Mr Eden Hurst is sexy, talented, intelligent – and resoundingly ineligible! What’s more, he doesn’t believe in love. It seems an impossible task, but Maude sets out to make Eden realise he needs love…and her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Society is about to see she can be just as shocking as her Ravenhurst friends when she puts her mind to it!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Disrobed and Dishonoured (&lt;em&gt;Those Scandalous Ravenhursts&lt;/em&gt;, Book 6)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hidden behind a mask, Jonathan Kirkland, Lord Redcliffe, has disguised himself as a highwayman to win a wager: to collect kisses from the first five women who pass.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With only one kiss left, victory seems easy. . . until he encounters Miss Sarah Tatton, who has fled on horseback to escape her vile fiancé. Distraught and desperate, the last thing Sarah needs is to run straight into the arms of a highwayman.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But his heart-stopping kiss gives Sarah an idea – to lose her virginity in order to break her engagement. And the surprisingly gentleman like thief is just the man to teach her the art of love. . . at least enough to pretend that she has lost her virtue. But as Jonathan and Sarah&#39;s passion grows, all pretence must come to an end. . .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Piratical Miss Ravenhurst (&lt;em&gt;Those Scandalous Ravenhursts&lt;/em&gt;, Book 7)&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alone and in danger, Clemence Ravenhurst is forced to flee her beloved Jamaica. Disguised as a boy, she falls straight into the clutches of one of the most dangerous pirates in the Caribbean! Nathan Stanier, disgraced undercover naval officer and navigator, protects Clemence on their perilous journey.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The heat between them sizzles. But honour and his guarded heart dictate that Nathan resist Clemence. Though it seems she&#39;s determined to make their adventure as outrageous and passionate as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
