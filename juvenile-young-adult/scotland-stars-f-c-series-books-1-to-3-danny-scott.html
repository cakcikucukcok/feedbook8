  <title>Scotland Stars F.C. series Books 1 to 3 - Danny Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an ebook-exclusive omnibus of books 1, 2 and 3 in the brilliant Scotland Stars F.C. football series. Don&#39;t miss a minute of the non-stop action as 10-year-old Calum Ferguson struggles to settle into a new town whilst fighting for his place on the school football team. Scotland Stars F.C. books are packed with excitement on and off the field, as well as loads of extras like football tips, puzzles and games. In the first book, Calum&#39;s New Team, Calum has just moved to Caleytown from the Highlands and is worried he won&#39;t fit in. That is, until he finds out from football-mad new pals Leo and Erika that a new boys&#39; football team is starting at school. The second book, Calum&#39;s New Boots, finds Calum going to a schools&#39; tournament in Edinburgh. But when Calum&#39;s new boots mysteriously go missing right before the match, will he be able to continue? In Calum&#39;s Big Break, Calum and best friend Leo get advice from their premiership hero. Then when a scout comes to watch their next match, they are ready to shine -- if nothing goes wrong…" />
