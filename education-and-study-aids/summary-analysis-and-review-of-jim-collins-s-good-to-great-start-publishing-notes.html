  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review?of Jim Collins’s Good to Great - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This is a &lt;i&gt;key takeaways&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;analysis&lt;/i&gt; of the book and &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; the original book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start Publishing Notes’ &lt;i&gt;Summary, Analysis, and Review?of Jim Collins’s Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don’t &lt;/i&gt; includes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary of the book&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis &amp; Key Takeaways&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A detailed “About the Author” section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preview:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don’t&lt;/i&gt;, Jim Collins posits that most American entities (from the federal government and multi-national corporations all the way down to individuals) are hindered by being &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;, and thus not rising to being &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt;. “That good is the enemy of great is not just a business problem,” he writes. “It is a &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; problem”(16). As such, the question naturally arises: Can a &lt;i&gt;good enough&lt;/i&gt; government, company, organization, or person become a great one? If so, is there a discrete methodology that might consistently yield a transformation form good to great? “Or is the disease of ‘just being good’ incurable?”(5). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, Collins and his team executed a massive research project (spanning five years and totaling a combined 15,000 hours of research for its twenty-one-person team). Rather than beginning with a hypothesis and drilling down for confirmation or falsification, Collins and his team started by collecting, coding, and analyzing raw data and existing writing and research. From there they worked their way up to a set of core practices among organizations that move from good to great, ultimately working up a linear roadmap any organization can follow to make such a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
