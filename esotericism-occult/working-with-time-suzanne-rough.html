  <title>Working with Time - Suzanne Rough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Working with Time deals with the matter of using the time frames, which enable astrologers to identify the opportunities available to us at any given stage in our lives. By supplementing the natal chart with primary directions, secondary progressions, and transits, an astrologer can build a detailed picture of any year of life and see the forms that opportunity will take at this time. This book shows how to work with these time-working techniques and offers a new perspective on difficult times and situations. All times of change are opportunities if we understand their nature and their purpose and know how to engage with them. 
Working with Time is recommended to astrology practitioners and to students with a working knowledge of horoscopy." />
