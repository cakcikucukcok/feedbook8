  <title>The Third Vision - Dr. Francis H. Vala Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book introduces a new visiona simple and comprehensive approach to understanding different aspects of humanity, and the complexities of this world, exemplified by a collection of extraordinary stories, and supported by a pile of science and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, humanity has been suffering from illnesses at individual, societal, and international levels. Anxiety, depression, prostitution, crime, and worldwide wars are only a few of these examples. Despite hundreds of spiritual, religious, and non-religious leaders, and in spite of tremendous advancements in science and technology, our collective problems are only growing. The question is why. What are we missing? The root of these problems points to one common elementnot fully understanding the multidimensional human being. We cannot solve the dilemmas of humanity with the same mind that created them! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is intended to help the general population explore some of the most complex mysteries of our world and seemingly unsolvable problems created by mankind. It provides a fast track for personal and global transformation based on science and evidence, using a bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model. Many concepts have been borrowed from outstanding scientists, philosophers, researchers, teachers, and leaders in the past and present, and a few more have been added by the author.&lt;/p&gt;" />
