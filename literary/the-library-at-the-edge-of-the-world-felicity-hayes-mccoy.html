  <title>The Library at the Edge of the World - Felicity Hayes-McCoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017 LibraryReads Pick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the bestselling tradition of Fannie Flagg and Jenny Colgan comes Felicity Hayes-McCoy&amp;#8217;s U.S. debut about a local librarian who must find a way to rebuild her community and her own life in this touching, enchanting novel set on Ireland&amp;#8217;s stunning West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she drives her mobile library van between villages of Ireland&amp;#8217;s West Coast, Hanna Casey tries not to think about a lot of things. Like the sophisticated lifestyle she abandoned after finding her English barrister husband in bed with another woman. Or that she&amp;#8217;s back in Lissbeg, the rural Irish town she walked away from in her teens, living in the back bedroom of her overbearing mother&amp;#8217;s retirement bungalow. Or, worse yet, her nagging fear that, as the local librarian and a prominent figure in the community, her failed marriage and ignominious return have made her a focus of gossip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With her teenage daughter, Jazz, off traveling the world and her relationship with her own mother growing increasingly tense, Hanna is determined to reclaim her independence by restoring a derelict cottage left to her by her great-aunt. But when the threatened closure of the Lissbeg Library puts her personal plans in jeopardy, Hanna finds herself leading a battle to restore the heart and soul of the Finfarran Peninsula&amp;#8217;s fragmented community.
