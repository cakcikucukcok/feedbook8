      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reece Wilde put everything in his life on the backburner to protect his brothers and their struggling company, Wilde Security. With a major contract on the line, Reece can&#39;t afford any mistakes...like getting caught in a red-hot, X-rated moment with wild child Shelby Bremer, who&#39;s more trouble than he can handle. Now he&#39;s being blackmailed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shelby&#39;s mile-long impulsive streak gets her in more trouble than she&#39;d like to admit. Between her sister&#39;s wedding, her coffee shop set on fire, and getting down and dirty with the groom&#39;s brother, things are definitely coming off the rails. With both their careers and their safety on the line, Reece is determined to keep them both safe...even if it means a Vegas-style shotgun wedding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But gambling on a wild card-and a wild soul-is risky...and sometimes, it can get a guy killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Wilde Security series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt; Book #1 Wilde Nights in Paradise &lt;br&gt; Book #2 Wilde for Her&lt;br&gt; Book #3 Wilde at Heart&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Running Wilde&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Too Wilde to Tame&lt;/p&gt;" />
