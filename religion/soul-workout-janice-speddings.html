  <title>Soul Workout - Janice Speddings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Using the words soul and workout in the same sentence may seem implausible and stretching artistic licence too far, but in the Soul Workout book, the improbable becomes believable and the only stretching to be done is metaphorical.
An imaginary visit to the gym for a workout becomes a metaphor for the spiritual disciplines of Bible reading, prayer, and contemplative reflection. Going to the gym may not be everybodys cup of tea, but when the idea is transposed into the metaphor, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief: lycra and dumbbells will not be required. 
What is needed is a willingness to be open to prayer, spiritual reflection, and a desire to look for creative ways to deepen your faith journey: this is what Soul Workout offers.
By methodically guiding you through the metaphor, Janice Speddings shows how different aspects of the gym have their spiritual counterpart: so cardiovascular exercise is likened to time spent building a deeper relationship with God (the heart and life-blood of the Christian faith) while spiritual weight-resistance exercise is seen as a way of learning to carry lifes burdens with added strength and resilience.
You need no previous experience of contemplative prayer as all the exercises are fully explained and offered at basic or advanced levels. 
Part 1 includes a helpful chapter for those with little or no experience of planning and running a group event while part 2 works through the metaphor step-by-step, including spiritual reflections as exercises: extra tips are offered for group leaders. Part 3 deals with hanging on to the feel-good factor after the workout is finished. 
As a tried-and-tested metaphor, this inspirational book provides a down-to-earth, easy-to-read resource for groups and individuals alikean essential companion for your spiritual journey." />
