  <title>The Unfinished Book About Who We Are: Book One - Joseph Rain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who are we and where are we going? What is reality and what is truth? How do we harness our full, limitless potential?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have been asking these questions since we became capable of self-reflection. Entire bodies of thought grew up around these questions. Wars have been fought over them; empires crumbled because of them; religions were created to explain them, and then to crush them. Even quantum physics has had plenty to say about them&amp;mdash;but we haven&amp;#39;t really listened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today&amp;#39;s breathless pace of technological and geopolitical change leaves us with little time or space to contemplate such things, but it has become more critical than ever that we do so. Can science and religion finally shake hands? Should our moral values inform or follow law? And most striking of all, what do quantum physics and spirituality have in common?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Written by a man whose background spans several cultures and multiple religions, who has experienced the highs and lows of personal and professional life, and who went through a deep personal tragedy when he was only in his twenties, &amp;quot;The Unfinished Book About Who We Are&amp;quot; invites you to explore some of humanity&amp;#39;s most tenacious and indelible questions&amp;mdash;and to find the answers that will take your own life to a different level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take a deep breath, because this book will take you farther than you thought you wanted to go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the book itself says, The One who seeks is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#39;ve ever wanted to examine the links among science and quantum physics, spirituality and religion, and humanity&amp;#39;s capacity to change its own evolution, this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
