  <title>The Killer Wore White - Kathryn M White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Greta L. Drake is not aware when she accepts a job at The Physician&#39;s Clinic that she is stepping into a horrific crime scene. She is informed only after she arrives that three women employees have disappeared without trace. Another will disappear while she is there and this will set her on a hunt for the killer. 
&lt;p&gt;She joins forces with Detective Cody Lunt, whose wife was killed by a drunk driver and whose daughter survives a brutal attack and rape. His hatred of men who would prey upon defenseless women is all the reason he needs to hunt for the killer. The other women working at the clinic are sure that the killer is in their midst. But who can it be? Who calls but doesn&#39;t say anything? Who follows them with their headlights on high beam? What could possibly be the motive? Could the killer be the doctor Greta falls in love with, Dr. Nathan Blevins? Or could it be his brother, Jeff, who is a veterinarian, in Charlottesville, Virginia, and who just happens to be visiting his brother when a woman comes up missing? 
&lt;p&gt;Greta leaves no stone unturnedher eyes and ears are open and she soon becomes suspicious of Dr. Raymond Moran, better know as Doc. Why is he so nosey and yet so private about himself? Where does he go every weekend? Or what about Lily Thompson, RN who is jealous, angry and bitter? The search for the killer will carry Detective Cody Lunt, to New York, Ohio, Georgia and many more places. It is a relentless search to stop a mad person before another woman leaves without a trace." />
