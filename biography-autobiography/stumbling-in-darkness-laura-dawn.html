  <title>Stumbling in Darkness - Laura Dawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title: &quot;Stumbling in Darkness ~ Separated from God (A journey to the Light)  ...is a life summarized. 
May this book inspire you to seek the LORD God, read His Wordthe Holy Bible, and get to know Him as He reveals Himself to you through the Spirit in Jesus Christ.
It is Gods will for all of us to know Him and receive Jesus as our Lord and Savior.
In both Testaments God says, I will be their God and they will be My children. 
(Lev 26:12) - (Rev 21:7) this statement is repeated many times. God desires to have a relationship with each one of us. Hes long suffering patiently waiting for us to come to Him. However, He has a set year, month, day and time  when the waiting ends.
Take an honest look at yourself and ask  do you know the love of God?
Do you know Jesus Christ personally?
Is your name written in The Book of Life?
Are you a slave to addictions, lost in sinful desires?
Will you be welcomed into the Kingdom of Heaven?
Do you put everyone and everything before and above God?
We are living in what Scripture calls  &quot;the last days&quot;  the end of life as we know it. 
Though it is a world without endas we know itis becoming a memory." />
