  <title>Coping with Diverticulitis - Peter Cartwright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diverticular disease (DD) is a digestive disorder caused by enflamed diverticula, or pouches, in the colon. A common cause is constipation due to lack of fibre in the diet. Diverticulitis is very common, with about 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK and 300,000 in the USA. Symptoms are usually persistent abdominal pain plus disturbed bowel function (constipation or diarrhoea or alternating between the two). Diverticulitis sometimes becomes very severe leading to perforation of the bowel, forming an abscess or rarely peritonitis. This best-selling book looks at the treatment and self-management of DD - while the doctor can help, particularly with antibiotics, much can be done by the individual to minimise the effects of this condition. This new edition updates this best-selling book. Updates include: - Advances in the medical treatment of diverticular disease such as the use of mesalamine (an anti-inflammatory agent) and rifaximin (an antibiotic) - The latest on probiotics (‘good’ or ‘friendly’ live bacteria and yeasts said to be good for digestive health - The increase of DD - acute diverticulitis, traditionally seen in the over-50s, is now being seen in younger adults who are obese - The link with irritable bowel syndrome, which can be a lasting after-effect of an acute bout of diverticulitis - Other psychological and physical symptoms which persist after acute attacks" />
