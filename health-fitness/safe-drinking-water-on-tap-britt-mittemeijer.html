  <title>Safe Drinking Water on Tap - Britt Mittemeijer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More than 20 years ago, when our children were very small, I felt the
need for better drinking water quality and I purchased a small counter top
appliance that hooked up to the water tap.
It didnt take long before I realized that this was just a bandaid and
that something more powerful was needed and thus I embarked on a
mission to educate myself about home drinking water filtration systems.
This was pretty much in the days before I had a computer, so I looked at
trade magazines and sent for every drinking water brochure I could find,
read them all and compared for quality and price. This convinced me very
quickly of the benefits and affordability of solid carbon block technology and
I ended up with a company that took the water filtration business very
seriously and in my opinion did produce and still produces" />
