  <title>Debbie&#39;s Big Black Surprise (The Bachelorette Party, #1) - Jane Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Debbie&#39;s bachelorette party is here and her friends have quite the surprise for her!  They all take her out, making her think she&#39;s going to go clubbing one last time, but instead, they head over to a quite seedy part of town.  Her friends take her to a male strip club far on the outskirts of the city!
The group of girls head in to see massive, muscular men showing off their gleaming sexual bodies under blinking lights and thunderous roars of music.  They meet one of the owners of the strip club, who invites them into a special room to celebrate Debbie&#39;s big party.
As the lights grow dim in the room they&#39;re in, Debbie and the others excitedly wait.  When two big black strippers dressed as African tribesmen appear, the girls get a taste of what&#39;s to come...  But as the final largest stripper shows up wearing a tight fitting spandex costume, they&#39;re left speechless.
Debbie&#39;s little party is about to become one amazing big black surprise!" />
