  <title>Book V. The improbable Rise of the Free Man - Roland Maes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Book V details the expansion of the Christian nations, their interaction with other religions and secular entities and ends with the potential role of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Napoleon applied to Europe the fascist views developed by the agnostic French Free-Masons, and left Europe in a state of ruin and chaos in 1815. Thirty years after the French nightmare, K. Marx wrote the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, in 1848. Its implementation in Russia and other countries generated about 100 million violent deaths. Hitler wrote &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (i.e. My Struggle) in 1926 and applied his views in 1933, which had generated about 45 million victims.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the American Revolution had produced nothing but the Declaration of Independence (1776), it would have been worthwhile. The words &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We hold &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, and the statement&lt;em&gt; &amp;quot;Governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, - pronounced 17 years before the French revolution took place but given by Frenchmen no heed because it made no sense to them, - are truly revolutionary. Since its incipience, the liberty of adhesion was respected and the US never indulged in a dictatorship. The capital of the Free Man is Washington.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rise of the US is essentially due to greed, avidity, incompetence, ideological stupidity and corruption of the leadership of competing nations. After WW II, the United States of America restated the Christian values of civilization that govern its internal and foreign policies. We are at an historical turning point because the contemporary preeminence of the US was challenged on 11 September 2001. Apparently, the American people in their vast majority were kept ignorant of the activities of its government and business leaders in foreign lands and was genuinely unaware that the credit enjoyed by America after WW II had been squandered. Contemporary elites &amp;ndash;worldwide- occupying the highest positions in the scientific, medical, economic, judiciary and political spheres offer the most flagrant examples of abjection, corruption, imposture, bad conduct, theft, vulgarity. Vile media scorn and deride the healthiest moral values. Crimes of which hundreds of thousands of people have suffered find no accountants. Finally, international relations more often appear to be plunder, brigandage, robbery and pillage than the pursuit of concord.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Islam proposes an alternative based on a holy book, the Coran. This Judaic heresy is devoid of any philosophical content and Islam obeys to the Sharia, which is a compilation of tradition. It proposes much good rules of conduct but admits also repulsive ones, as slavery, female subjection, polygamy, outrageous taxation of non-believers, deceit with foreigners and cruel justice, which the Prophet Mohamed had to concede to convert barbaric nomad tribes. The statements that all men are created equal and that (women) have a right to liberty and pursuit of happiness are utterly foreign to Moslems, to whom they make no sense. When Moslem natives of a Christian land do neither understand its spirit nor obey its customs, and endeavor to impose the Sharia in their homeland, it generates violence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book, I will show how mankind arrived at such a remarkable statement as the USA declaration of independence, and that challenges originating from within the USA as well as from without demand a constant attention. The leadership of free men rests on consensus and harmonious economic development. It can be achieved by a method of government where mind and emotion are united in humane thought. It must urgently face the mounting confrontation of Jewish and Islamic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
