  <title>This Shall Be a House of Peace - Phil Halton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A shocking retelling of the humble origins of the Taliban movement and their deeply conflicted moral journey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chaos reigns in the wake of the collapse of Afghanistan&#39;s Soviet-backed government. In the rural, warlord-ruled south, a student is badly beaten at a checkpoint run by bandits. His mullah, who leads a madrassa for orphans left behind by Afghanistan’s civil war, leads his students back to the checkpoint and forces the bandits out. His actions set in motion a chain of events that will change the balance of power in his country and send shock waves through history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Amid villagers seeking protection and warlords seeking power, the Mullah&#39;s influence grows. Against the backdrop of anarchy dominated by armed factions, he devotes himself to building a house of peace with his students — or, as they are called in Pashto, &lt;i&gt;Taliban&lt;/i&gt;. Part intrigue, part war narrative, and part historical drama, &lt;i&gt;This Shall Be a House of Peace&lt;/i&gt; charts their breathtaking ambition, transformation, and rise to power." />
