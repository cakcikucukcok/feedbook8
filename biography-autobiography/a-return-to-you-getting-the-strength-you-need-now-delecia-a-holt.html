  <title>A Return to You-&quot;Getting the Strength You Need - Now&quot; - Delecia A. Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;Everything that we see, hear, smell, touch, taste, say, or do not say, has consequences. Four years of research, a lifetime of personal and collective experiences, and there is still more to do. I have observed one very important fact. That we, humans, tend to seek out others with similar beliefs, a similar &#39;base.&#39; With them we find a comfort zone. We tend to strive for that level point, that provides us comfort. Because at that level, we have no one to impress. They are on the same plane we are for the moment. &lt;P&gt;
That is until a life experience occurs, and one or both of us changes due to our belief systems formed within our &#39;base.&#39; Our &#39;bases&#39; influence every aspect of our lives, and the lives of those we interact with. We will explore this concept further in the book. &lt;P&gt;
For now, think of our &#39;base&#39; as the center of our physical and intellectual being. That place within the core of our spirits. Which provides us with the strength needed to survive all life&#39;s trials." />
