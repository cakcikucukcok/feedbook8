~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
&quot;Are you here alone, ma&#39;am?&quot; he asked, exchanging her empty drink for a full one.
Cute looking kid, she thought. His dirty blond hair was slightly messy, and the casual unbuttoned flannel left little to the imagination. She could glimpse the firm muscles on him. She missed having a man in the house.
&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; he prompted.
&quot;Yep,&quot; she smiled at him. &quot;Just me.&quot;
&quot;My friend and I wouldn&#39;t mind keeping you company,&quot; he winked at her, his fingertips touching hers as he handed her the drink.
She chuckled, &quot;I think you would rather be with someone your own age.&quot;
&quot;Not really,&quot; he grinned, his lips curved into a seductive smile. He turned and motioned for his &#39;friend&#39; to come forward.
His friend was buffer and looked like your average football jock. Unlike his friend, he wasn&#39;t wearing a flannel shirt. Nor was he wearing beach pants. In fact, he wasn&#39;t wearing anything at all. She could see his massive erection from a mile away. He looked unashamed and he had little to be embarrassed about. His muscles were toned and well-defined. He looked like one of those statues of Greek gods.
&quot;Hello, beautiful,&quot; his new friend called. &quot;You ready for us?&quot;
&quot;Aren&#39;t you boys too young for me?&quot; she asked, licking her lips..." />
