She believes herself well beyond the reach of the guild that controls all magic within the empire until Benim, an unwilling guild soldier, appears at her door. She&#39;s part of his quest to assemble gifted citizens for entrance to University.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As Kailey struggles to navigate the strange society of the Sarian upper class, she&#39;s tasked by a guild master to create a masterpiece for the emperor. And when Benim is commissioned as her model, Kailey comes to crave the hard-bodied soldier she spends her days sculpting inch by intimate inch.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Benim cannot resist the warmth of Kailey&#39;s spirit nor the comforts found within her body, though he knows that a poor soldier has no place in a mage&#39;s world. But he and Kailey will have to overcome more than just class differences in order to remain together.
