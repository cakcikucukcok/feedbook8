  <title>The Last Prophet - Peter James Iengo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before time itself, angels were engaged in a bloody war. Heaven had been divided into light and darkness. Lucifer, the first of all angels, rebelled against God. His disapproval of the future of man corrupted his very mind. Driven with pure vengeance, Lucifer led an army known as the Fallen, a group of angels who believed in his ideals. It is said that all angels are brothers and sisters. Although this is true, it was something more, something deeper for Michael and Lucifer. For they shared a bond as no other; the two brothers, who once served together, now fought each other. Lucifer was defeated by Michael and was banished to a prison like no other to suffer and govern over the sins of man. His army, the few that remained, fled to the earth and hid among men. Lucifer was to suffer in his prison until the year AD 2012, where he would be freed to the realm of the living. His fallen army spent centuries seeking a secret order formed by a group of holy warriors called the Creed. The true mission of this order and Creed was to seek out a new prophet in the year 2012. This new prophet would be chosen to wield godly powers to stand against Lucifer and his apocalyptic army to save mankind from the end of days." />
