  <title>Walking into the Wind - Barbra Goodyear Minar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Barbra Minar writes about excelling in life in spite of disease and disabilities. Since 1960 she has battled systemic lupus erythematosus. In l985 with new medical complications Minar wrestled with a deep depression. She decided to tackle her denial, accept her situation, and find health. Using her journal entries and letters, she shares experiences and practical tips, combining support and understanding. When illness limits us, Minar shows  how  to discover rich new emotional, physical, and spiritual paths. &lt;B&gt;WALKING INTO THE WIND&lt;B&gt; is her fourth book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for&lt;B&gt; WALKING INTO THE WIND: Being Healthy With A Chronic Disease&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open and compassionate description of how systemic lupus erythematosus struck body and soul. Minar describes with great honesty the challenge the disease has posed on her own emotions, her spirituality, her relationships. . . . . However, her book is more about life than about a chronic disease. The stormy winds of her chronic disease have finally become a lifting force to higher values of truth and life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;H. RICHARD BARTHEL, MD, RHEUMOTOLOGIST&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary story. Minar has turned the malevolence of lupus back on itself and recorded the process. You discover you can become a wiser and more powerful person than a normally 
healthy woman ever dreamed of becoming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;B&gt; DIANE DE AVALLE-ARCE
  Editor, Reviewer, Literary Critic&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt as though I was eavesdropping on your life. But thats exactly what I needed. Ive kept so much inside me for the past 3 1/2 years that Ive been sick. Thank you, Barbra, for being so human. The way you have allowed God to work in you is an inspiration to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;B&gt;VICKI EWY&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbra Minar offers a gracious gift to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
