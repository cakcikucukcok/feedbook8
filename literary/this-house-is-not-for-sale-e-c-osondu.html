  <title>This House Is Not For Sale - E.C. Osondu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Voice of America&lt;/em&gt; paints a vivid, fully imagined portrait of an extraordinary African family and the house that holds them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful tale of family and community, &lt;em&gt;This House Is Not for Sale&lt;/em&gt; brings to life an African neighborhood and one remarkable house, seen through the eyes of a young member of the household. The house lies in a town seemingly lost in time, full of colorful, larger-than-life characters; at the narrative&amp;#8217;s heart are Grandpa, the family patriarch whose occasional cruelty is balanced by his willingness to open his doors to those in need, and the house itself, which becomes a character in its own right and takes on the scale of legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the decades-long rivalry between owners of two competing convenience stores to the man who convinces his neighbors to give up their earthly possessions to prepare for the end of the world, Osondu&amp;#8217;s story captures a place beyond the reach of the outside world, full of superstitions and myths that sustain its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osondu&amp;#8217;s prose has the lightness and magic of fable, but his themes&amp;#8212;poverty, disease, the arrival of civilization in an isolated community&amp;#8212;are timeless and profound. At once full of joyful energy and quiet heartbreak, &lt;em&gt;This House Is Not for Sale&lt;/em&gt; is an utterly original novel from a master storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
