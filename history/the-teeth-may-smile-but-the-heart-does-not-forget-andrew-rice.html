  <title>The Teeth May Smile but the Heart Does Not Forget - Andrew Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From a new star of American journalism, a riveting murder mystery that reveals the forces roiling today&#39;s Africa&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Rwanda to Sierra Leone, African countries recovering from tyranny and war are facing an impossible dilemma: to overlook past atrocities for the sake of peace or to seek catharsis through tribunals and truth commissions. Uganda chose the path of forgetting: after Idi Amin&#39;s reign was overthrown, the new government opted for amnesty for his henchmen rather than prolonged conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ugandans tried to bury their history, but reminders of the truth were never far from view. A stray clue to the 1972 disappearance of Eliphaz Laki led his son to a shallow grave--and then to three executioners, among them Amin&#39;s chief of staff. Laki&#39;s discovery resulted in a trial that gave voice to a nation&#39;s past: as lawyers argued, tribes clashed, and Laki pressed for justice, the trial offered Ugandans a promise of the reckoning they had been so long denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For four years, Andrew Rice followed the trial, crossing Uganda to investigate Amin&#39;s legacy and the limits of reconciliation. At once a mystery, a historical accounting, and a portrait of modern Africa, &lt;i&gt;The Teeth May Smile But the Heart Does Not Forget&lt;/i&gt; is above all an exploration of how -- and whether -- the past can be laid to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&#39; Best Books of 2009&lt;/p&gt;" />
