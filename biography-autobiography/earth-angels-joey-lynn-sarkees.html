  <title>Earth Angels - Joey Lynn Sarkees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Earth Angels&lt;/i&gt;  is the true story of Molly Perchinski and sixteen of her Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) Womens Rugby Club teammates who risked their young lives to save countless others after witnessing one of the worst accidents in Pennsylvania Turnpike history. On a foggy April morning in 2003, the women were en route to a rugby match when they became involved in a fog-related accident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; They spent the next several hours aiding victims and helping medical personnel while in danger themselves. They operated as one unit while surrounded by burning vehicles, bleeding victims, and chaos. Their acts were selfless and brave. As a result, the women were honored by &lt;i&gt;Readers Digest&lt;/i&gt;, the Pennsylvania State Police, and IUP. They were also highly recognized by local and national media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is also the tragic story of the Moyer family, who was traveling to their native state of Connecticut to visit family when they became involved in the fog-related accident. At its core, &lt;i&gt;Earth Angels&lt;/i&gt;  focuses on social evolution and a strong sense of empowerment by a group of young women who clearly displayed a strength that was generated from the bond they formed playing a team sport together.&lt;/p&gt;" />
