  <title>Plain Jane Marries The Boss (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Elizabeth Harbison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Cinderella Brides: These women are living out their very own fairy tales… but will they live happily ever after?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;SCHEDULE A WEDDING… AND FIND ME A WIFE!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It had taken five years, but Jane Miller&#39;s dynamic, handsome and commanding boss had FINALLY proposed–even though she knew he&#39;d never seen the shy, yearning glances she&#39;d sent him. She was so happy she could cry–and did when she heard the rest of the plan!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because although this was a real wedding, it wouldn&#39;t be a real marriage. Trey Breckenridge III had business mergers in the making, and needed a wife to seal the deal. But &quot;Plain&quot; Jane made an additional wedding vow–that before the honeymoon was over, Trey would realize just what he&#39;d been missing all these years…&lt;/p&gt;
