  <title>Different Dreams:Reflections and Realities of Raising A Child With Developmental Disabilities A Road Map For New Parents - Mary Kay DeGenova, Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary Kay DeGenova was in a neurologist&#39;s waiting room when she saw a mother cradling a newborn in her arms. The mother was wiping away tears as she looked around at the other kids-some of whom were running around while others were in wheelchairs with feeding tubes.   The look on the new mom&#39;s face brought back all the emotions DeGenova felt when she first began her own journey as a parent of a child with developmental disabilities.   In this guide for new parents, DeGenova shares the challenges she&#39;s overcome and what other parents of a child with developmental disabilities can expect on their own respective journeys.   DeGenova provides comfort to other parents with a child with developmental disabilities by letting them know they are not alone, as well as highlighting the overwhelming beauty and joy that is inevitable on this parenting path. More importantly, she shares useful advice and strategies to help new parents navigate the complicated world of raising a child with a developmental disability." />
