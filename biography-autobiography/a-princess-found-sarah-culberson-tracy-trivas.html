  <title>A Princess Found - Sarah Culberson, Tracy Trivas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah Culberson was adopted one year after her birth by a loving, white, West Virginian couple and was raised in the United States with little knowledge of her ancestry.  Though raised in a loving family, Sarah wanted to know more about the birth parents that had given her up. In 2004, she hired a private investigator to track down her biological father.  When she began her search, she never imagined what she would discover or where that information would lead her: she was related to African royalty, a ruling Mende family in Sierra Leone and that she is considered a &lt;i&gt;mahaloi, &lt;/i&gt;the child of a Paramount Chief, with the status like a princess.  What followed was an unforgettably emotional journey of discovery of herself, a father she never knew, and the spirit of a war-torn nation.  &lt;i&gt;A Princess Found&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, intimate revelation of her quest across the world to learn of the chiefdom she could one day call her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
