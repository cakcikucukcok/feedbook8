  <title>America Unraveled - Phillip Torsrud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Most Americans are concerned about their politicians inability to identify, much less solve their nations problems.  America Unraveled explores a number of Americas most pressing social issues, the economy, justice system, culture, and many historical events occurring between 2008 and 2012.  Incompetence is attacked in a bipartisan manner with the authors loyalty going to truth, common sense, and logic.  Why should any American have allegiance to Democrats or Republicans when they seem so preoccupied with serving the private interests of their big money supporters.  If you are looking for real constructive criticism, this book is for you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Phillip Torsrud has also written Preemptive Strike which is a novel on human trafficking, and Essays of a Penitentiary Philosopher which explores the structural failings of Americas Justice system.  While many of the topics addressed in America Unraveled are complicated, the simple and direct style of writing makes the reading not only easy, but enjoyable.&lt;/P&gt;" />
