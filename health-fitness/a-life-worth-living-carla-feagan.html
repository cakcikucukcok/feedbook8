  <title>A Life Worth Living - Carla Feagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have baggage that we carry around. This baggage may come from ingrained beliefs about oneself or past traumatic experiences. No matter where our baggage comes from or why it&amp;rsquo;s there, our past experiences tend to show their presence when least expected or wanted. The good thing is that we can all let that baggage go so it does not affect us in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carla talks about how her belief system was ingrained at an early age and how traumatic experiences solidified those beliefs. Throughout her story you&amp;rsquo;ll see how her decisions were affected by those demons rising when she least expected and the resulting impacts. It is also a realization of the inner strength that kept her going, the process of setting those beliefs free, and the will to live a life she deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow her path from abuse and trauma to a life living in paradise. This is a story of freedom, of laughter, of loving, of shame, of healing, and of becoming brave enough to be vulnerable. This story will resonate with many people, allowing them to see there is a light at the end of the tunnel and true happiness waiting just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;" />
