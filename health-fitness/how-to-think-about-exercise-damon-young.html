  <title>How to Think About Exercise - Damon Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;USING PHILOSOPHY TO EXPLORE THE BIG IDEAS BEHIND FITNESS AND WAYS TO ENJOY EXERCISE WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR MIND BEHIND&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can often seem as though existence is split in two: body and mind, flesh and spirit, moving and thinking. In the office or at study we are &#39;mind workers,&#39; with seemingly superfluous bodies. Conversely, in the gym we stretch, run and lift, but our minds are idle. In &lt;i&gt;How to Think About Exercise&lt;/i&gt;, author and philosopher Damon Young challenges this idea of separation, revealing how fitness can develop our bodies and minds as one. Exploring exercises and sports with the help of ancient and modern philosophy, he uncovers the pleasures, virtues and big ideas of fitness. By learning how to exercise intelligently, we are contributing to our overall enjoyment of life and enhancing our full humanity. Find out how bestselling author Haruki Murakami quit smoking and took up running, and why the simple act radically changed his whole outlook on life; why Schopenhauer thought that swimming was a sublime act; how Charles Darwin came up with some of his best ideas while exercising; and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The School of Life&lt;/i&gt; is dedicated to exploring life&#39;s big questions: How can we fulfill our potential? Can work be inspiring? Why does community matter? Can relationships last a lifetime? We don&#39;t have all the answers, but we will direct you toward a variety of useful ideas--from philosophy to literature, from psychology to the visual arts--that are guaranteed to stimulate, provoke, nourish, and console.&lt;/p&gt;" />
