  <title>Spiritually Circumcise Your Heart &amp;  Mind - Timothy Leigh Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over the past sixteen years, I have been in the process of writing what God has put on my heart and mind. Of course, with time, both has been through a lot of things, changes of life, but most importantly, the process of being circumcised of the norms of what is being taught in our Sunday schools, pulpits, and the traditions of men throughout a lot of churches. Yes, things have changed, but the core of what was given me is in full labor, ready to be birthed. Well, those days are over; I have to let what is in me out so God can replenish me with a fresh revelation of his Word and plan for mankind. His Word never changes, but it will impregnate your mind to whereby you are in labor pains to birth that which has been given to you. I hope this book will open the eyes and understanding of many, answer some questions, drive you into the Word, and most of all pierce the heart to be more receptacles of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Remember, Jesus said in Mark 13:13, And ye shall be hated of all men for my name&#39;s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
God is guarantee of deliverance for his children who believe in and on his Son, Jesus Christ, and because of his love (level of victory eternally) that his children may have eternal life with him. Jesus said in Matthew 24:13, But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved, and the opposite of that statement is those who do not endure until the end will not be saved." />
