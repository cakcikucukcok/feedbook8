  <title>Destiny: the Odds of You and  I - Irina V. Boca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a world where lives intertwine in a surreally unpredictable way, destiny awaits an eclectic blend of souls who desire love more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man sits alone in a restaurant, his mind perfectly at anchor with his living memoir as he quietly observes the only other person sharing the room with him: an unaccompanied woman also lost in her thoughts. Absurdly drawn to her while he waits for his brunch date to arrive, Richard silently wills her to speak to him. Amid the stirring echoes of memory, the noise of the stock exchange, the sophistication of the theater, and the serendipity of private business, two tortured souls who long for love must somehow manage to find each other amid a crowded world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unique novel opens the door to a new way of looking at the nature and purpose of relationships, as a man and a woman await their destinies and long for love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
