  <title>The Gambler - Fyodor Dostoyevsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gambler is a short novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky about a young tutor in the employment of a formerly wealthy Russian general. The novella reflects Dostoyevsky&amp;#39;s own addiction to roulette, which was in more ways than one the inspiration for the book: Dostoyevsky completed the novella under a strict deadline to pay off gambling debts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gambler treated a subject Fyodor Dostoyevsky himself was familiar with&amp;mdash;gambling. The first-person narrative is told from the point of view of Alexei Ivanovich, a tutor working for a Russian family living in a suite at a German hotel. The patriarch of the family, The General, is indebted to the Frenchman De Grieux and has mortgaged his property in Russia to pay only a small amount of his debt. Upon learning of the illness of his wealthy aunt, &amp;quot;Grandmother&amp;quot;, he sends streams of telegrams to Moscow and awaits the news of her demise. His expected inheritance will pay his debts and gain Madamoiselle De Cominges&amp;#39;s hand in marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three films have been based on the book. The Great Sinner, in 1949. The Gambler, released in 1974, The Gamblers, a German film released in 2007." />
