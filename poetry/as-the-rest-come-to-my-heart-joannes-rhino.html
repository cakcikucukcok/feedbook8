  <title>As the Rest Come to My Heart - Joannes Rhino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pain, specifically the pain of a loss, is an unavoidable fact of life. Some of us have had so much pain that we are overwhelmed by it. The thought of trying to work through the pain, to face the realities of what has happened, may make us feel like shutting down and giving up. However, there is hope. There is a way to work through pain and to come out the other side stronger. In the end we have to make peace with the past in order to continue this life.
The poetry collection As the Rest Come to My Heart was made during the most troublesome moments of Joannes Rhinos last 10 years of life, when dark clouds enveloped him. Anger, anxiety, emptiness, guilt and lost love coalesced into a single, unbearable emotion." />
