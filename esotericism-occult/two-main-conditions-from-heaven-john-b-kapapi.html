  <title>Two  Main Conditions from Heaven - John B. Kapapi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heaven is Gods throne and Christians home also. Gods intention is to bring every believer where He is (John 14: 1-4 and Acts 1: 11). Here on earth, Jesus warned them not to be conformed to the pattern of this world, but to live according to the desires of the Spirit which are the components of the fruit of the Spirit as mentioned in Galatians 5: 22-23. We refer to them as the qualities of heaven because they are divinely inspired. Christian life is a life characterized by Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness,   Gentleness, and Self-control.  So is the baptism by the water and by the Sprit. Jesus instructed us to be baptized because it is important. The bible says that we were buried with Christ through baptism (Roman 6: 4 and Colossians 2: 12 NIV), and united with him in his resurrection (Romans 6: 5 NIV).  The connection is evident. Because he paid the price for our transgressions, we must live his way, the way of the Spirit. Jesus furnishes us with the motive by living by examples. It is by living by the Spirit that we will be able to separate ourselves from the cursed who will be cast into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41). But why the baptism is so important to Jesus? Find out." />
