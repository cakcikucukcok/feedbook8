  <title>The Check - Clair Harmony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a FIVE STAR story of how an ordinary man became a Billionaire over night. He is a postman for the United States Mail Service, and a former Marine, who discovers that checks are going out over his signature from his own personal checking account. The checks quickly escalate beyond tens of millions of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The FBI gets involved and discussions reach the ears of the White House, especially after a commando style rocket attack against the Postman and his girlfriend at a Southern California shopping mall, in the City of Diamond Bar. The story goes viral and our hero decides to arm himself. This leads to Black Ops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What used to be a game of freezing the funds of criminals, terrorists, drug cartels, dictators, and every other bad guy is now the fleecing of their ill gotten gains, and subsequently delivering their money in the mail to people and organizations in need. This is a complex tale of modern-day Robin Hoodism, laced with artificial intelligence and providing a level playing field for all Mankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
