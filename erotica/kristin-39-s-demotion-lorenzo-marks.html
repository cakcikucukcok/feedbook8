  <title>Kristin&#39;s Demotion - Lorenzo Marks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When OFS Software sales executive, Henry Shepard, is assigned to work with new recruit, Kristin Hartman, he thinks his luck has taken a turn for the better. Young, stunningly beautiful, and with a body to die for, Kristin is the object of every man&#39;s desire. Henry&#39;s hopes are quickly dashed however, as Kristin uses her charm and wits to beat him to the vacant vice presidential position, and later takes great pleasure in firing him. Whilst wallowing in his defeat, Henry unexpectedly discovers that Kristin&#39;s rise to power involved illegally acquired software. He confronts her with the evidence of her crime and offers her a deal: in return for his silence, she is to obey his every command - effectively becoming his slave. Kristin is initially horrified but after considering her options, reluctantly agrees to go along with his &#39;arrangement&#39; until she can figure a way out. She soon discovers however, that Henry has no intention of giving her a moment&#39;s rest, as she is systematically stripped of first her clothing and then her dignity. Caned, collared, gagged, publicly humiliated, forced into oral sex, Kristin is kept in a constant state of fear, pain and confusion. Henry meanwhile, is discovering a new dark side to himself as he pushes Kristin&#39;s limits of degradation ever further. Convinced now that he has Kristin totally under his control, Henry takes the game to a higher level when he gives her a new job description at OFS - she is forced to act the part of the office bimbo, which includes sexually servicing clients and co-workers alike. Now at her nadir, Kristin begins to lose her identity as she carries out her increasingly demeaning instructions without protest. She dimly recalls the proud and intelligent woman she once was, but can she find an escape route before her subjugation becomes complete and irreversible?" />
