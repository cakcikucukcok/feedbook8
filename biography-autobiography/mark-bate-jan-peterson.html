  <title>Mark Bate - Jan Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An insightful look at the first mayor of Nanaimo, BC, drawing heavily on his prolific and insightful written observations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Bate, elected Nanaimo’s first mayor in 1875, was a renaissance man. He loved music, writing, literature, the outdoors, community affairs, and of course politics. Bate served as mayor for sixteen terms—most by acclamation. He retired three times, returning to office after being persuaded to serve again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historian Jan Peterson skillfully weaves Bate’s own writing—including personal letters, business correspondence, and speeches—into the rich tapestry of nineteenth-century Nanaimo to create a three-dimensional portrait of a truly fascinating man. Bates witnessed and documented Nanaimo’s evolution from mining settlement to incorporated municipality to bona fide city. &lt;i&gt;Mark Bate: Nanaimo’s First Mayor&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of this region and the settlers who helped to shape its communities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
