  <title>Evaluating Qualitative Research - Jeasik Cho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Qualitative researchers read journal articles, serve on masters&#39; and doctoral committees, make careful decisions on whether conference proposals, manuscripts, or large-scale grant applications should be accepted or rejected; yet, best practices on how to do this work thoroughly and efficiently have gained little attention over the last few decades.
&lt;em&gt;Evaluating Qualitative Research&lt;/em&gt; provides expert insight and advice on how to evaluate the merit of qualitative research in the academic community. As one of the first works of literature to address this gap in the exploration of theory, practice, and reflection that comes with the evaluation of qualitative research, author Jeasik Cho constructs a typology of evaluation by examining actual information collected from a variety of websites and relevant journals. By analyzing a host of journals&#39; established review guidelines and assessment apparatuses, Cho presents readers with the core criteria that stands out amongst these tools. As a result, readers will be able to confidently agree upon the standards for how to best evaluate qualitative research not only for their work but for the community at large." />
