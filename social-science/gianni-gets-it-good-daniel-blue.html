  <title>Gianni Gets It Good - Daniel Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gianni&#39;s English is not good, but he wants to tell you his story in his own words and in his own inimitable way.  Join him on his journey as he travels from being a young Italian cub to a fully fledged bear, going on holiday to far flung places with his overbearing Mama and sweet, long-suffering Papi and meeting - and mating - hot men in each destination. Gianni needs lots of love and he takes it wherever he finds it. After stumbling into his first encounter in Gran Canaria, Gianni never looks back. He realizes that often the kind of big, beefy man that he finds attractive finds him utterly irresistible too and he works his honey-pot to his advantage.  This book is a reworking of my Gianni short stories into which I have injected a good deal more of hot man-loving, Gianni style. His is one of my favourite characters and I hope you enjoy reading about Gianni&#39;s sexual adventures as much I enjoyed writing about them." />
