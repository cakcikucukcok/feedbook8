  <title>Value and Courage - Eduardo Villegas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Regardless of your circumstances, God has big plans for you today. He put dreams in your soul that, although buried, breathe; and He put ideas in your heart that, although they seem unattainable, are possible, with His guidance. He hasnt abandoned you or any of your dreams. He doesnt deny you or your complete manifestation of His glory. Your dreams, if they come from God, are real, possible. He thought of them and He entrusted them to you, which is why David said The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me... We must not ignore Gods dreams, because they are His will, meaning they can and must be achieved. 
Excuses, on the other hand, dont exist, rather they are illusions. We can construct them with many justifications so they seem real, but sooner or later they will bring sadnessExcuses mustnt replace your dreams; your mission must not be cut short. 
In this book you will discover how great your Value is to God according to His Word, and later you will develop Courage to dare to do His will, guided by Him. I cant think of a greater responsibility than to carry out Gods dreams, so go ahead and begin a new life with Value and Courage." />
