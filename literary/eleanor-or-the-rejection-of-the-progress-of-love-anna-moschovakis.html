  <title>Eleanor, or, The Rejection of the Progress of Love - Anna Moschovakis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anna Moschovakis is one of our most intensely curious poets—a writer whose work is constantly pushing against received notions of how we should be, and what questions we should ask. In this, her first novel, those preoccupations take narrative form in a novel about our responsibility for self-definition, for meaning, and for an ethics that reflects more than the thin gruel of our own experiences and desires. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Eleanor&lt;/i&gt; is a distinctly feminist novel, a metafiction whose humor and intelligence rivals &lt;i&gt;Leaving the Atocha Station&lt;/i&gt;, and a book that feels pressingly contemporary in its concerns. The personal is political to Anna, and both come roaringly to life here. 
Passivity, and the tendency to let life happen to you, are one of the foils here, as is the conviction that ideas are experiences. And the form all of this is delivered in is a heady page-turner of a novel. &lt;br&gt;
The warmth of the response we saw for &lt;i&gt;The Gift&lt;/i&gt; gives every confidence that this similarly brainy, thoughful, humane, political, and art-obsessed novel has an audience just waiting for another shot of smart writing by women about being a person in the world." />
