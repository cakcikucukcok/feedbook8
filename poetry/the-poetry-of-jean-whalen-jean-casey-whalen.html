  <title>The Poetry of Jean Whalen - Jean Casey-Whalen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jean Whalens colorful life spans over nine decadesand nine children. She spent the years of her childhood struggling through the Depression in the American Midwest. She lived through the terror of World War II and eventually saw the dawn of a new century. Through it all, she chronicled her life in verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Poetry of Jean Whalen: Book One&lt;/i&gt; gives voice to the timeless human truths of perseverance, faith, and love. The Cow is a little girls observation of the big world from her view on the farm. She entertains her young life as a romantic in Tall Trouble. Gentle humor brings grace to The Hunter and A Little Mixed Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whalen embraces lifes lighter moments, despite the darkness that lingers along its edges. Her words bring inspiration to the lost and despairing, and pain is captured by beauty. Whalen has spent her life encouraging and inspiring those around her, driven by a desire to contribute to the lives of others. Her ninety years of experience speak volumes through poetry and bring effervescent light to the dark.&lt;/p&gt;" />
