  <title>The Status Syndrome - Michael Marmot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Based on decades of his own research, a pioneering epidemiologist reveals the surprising factors behind who lives longer and why&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably didn&#39;t realize that when you graduated from college you increased your lifespan, or that your co-worker who has a master&#39;s degree is more likely to live a longer and healthier life. Seemingly small social differences in education, job title, income, even the size of your house or apartment have a profound impact on your health.&lt;br&gt;For years we have focused merely on how advances in technology and genetics can extend our lives and cure disease. But as Sir Michael Marmot argues, we are looking at the issue backwards. Social inequalities are not a footnote to the real causes of ill health in industrialized countries; they are the cause. The psychological experience of inequality, Marmot shows, has a profound effect on our lives. And while this may be alarming, it also suggests a ray of hope. If we can understand these social inequalities, we can also mitigate their effects. &lt;br&gt;In this groundbreaking book, Marmot, an internationally renowned epidemiologist, marshals evidence from around the world and from nearly thirty years of his research to demonstrate that how much control you have over your life and the opportunities you have for full social participation are crucial for health, well-being, and longevity. Just as &lt;i&gt;Bowling Alone&lt;/i&gt; changed the way we think about community in America, &lt;i&gt;The Status Syndrome&lt;/i&gt; will change the way we think about our society and how we live our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
