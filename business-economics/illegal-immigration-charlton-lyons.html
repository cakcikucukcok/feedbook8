      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE CONSEQUENCE OF MISPLACED TRUST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Laymans Close, Hard Look at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever asked yourself some of these questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why has our government failed in its duty to protect our border with Mexico? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why has our government permitted the use of our ports of entry by millions of aliens who,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once safely through the gates, disappear into the crowd and become illegal immigrants like those who steal across the border? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why is it that for the past 25 years our government has been seemingly quite incapable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; of preventing employers in our country from hiring illegal immigrants when that was the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; specific means by which that same government promised us an end to illegal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;immigration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why must we have illegal immigration in the first place? Whats been the cause of it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youve wondered about that and would like to know the truth about these matters, then &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you will find it here in this book. Answers that are clearly stated, fact-based and so logical as to be altogether unavoidable. Answers that, in addition, are almost certain to surprise you, since they are not the answers to these questions that we hear from our columnists or from our talking heads and certainly not from our politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of illegal immigration stands in stark contrast with our countrys policies and its laws. In explaining how we came to be so afflicted with it, this book will open up a whole new world for you, a world of which youve likely been largely oblivious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, this is an honest book, a book that you can trust, something youll discover for  yourselfand by no later than in its first chapter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
