  <title>The Exceptional Negro - Traci D O&#39;Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lawyer. Mother. Elected Official. Target. Traci O&amp;rsquo;Neal was thrust into the national spotlight in 2017 when local threats grew into a national racist outcry after a former GOP Presidential candidate singled her out on social media.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What followed was a deeply disturbing and widespread campaign of hatred and egregiously racist attacks.&amp;nbsp;The death threats, harassment, and vitriol reinforced what Traci had always understood &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no room in white America for an Exceptional Negro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exceptional Negro: Racism, White&amp;nbsp;Privilege and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Lie of&amp;nbsp;Respectability Politics&amp;nbsp;tells the story of how Traci went from a black, female attorney, living a very solidly middle-class life, feeling&amp;nbsp;insulated from &amp;ldquo;too much&amp;rdquo; racism because of her education and socioeconomic status, to the realization that it was all the lie of respectability politics, and at the end of day, she is still a negro in white America&amp;rsquo;s eyes, albeit an exceptional one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exceptional Negro&amp;nbsp;is a frank&amp;nbsp;discussion of race, law, and politics.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Through Traci&amp;rsquo;s lens as a &amp;ldquo;reformed Exceptional Negro&amp;rdquo;, she issues a call to action for white folks to dismantle systemic racism and more importantly, for black folks to discuss and consider the &amp;ldquo;Pro-Black Reconstruction Strategy&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;to lessen dependence on&amp;nbsp; America&amp;rsquo;s racist systems, and thus, the impact of racism in their lives.&amp;nbsp; America expects black people to assimilate, which by definition, fixes &amp;quot;whiteness&amp;quot; as the standard.
