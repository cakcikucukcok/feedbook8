  <title>Forbidden Places: The Welder - Vanessa Salt, Martin Reib Petersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;&quot;Yazmin,&quot; Love mumbles between her lips. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting this...&quot;
  &quot;Stop talking,&quot; she whispers back.
  Yazmin doesn&#39;t let Love shut his mouth. Her lips are so soft, but also very firm. And moist. They moisten Love&#39;s lips while she slowly, very slowly, lets the tip of her tongue join the game. It forces itself between their lips, it makes its way in to explore Love&#39;s teeth, before she lets him do likewise.&quot;
Love is 30 years old, responsible for Health and Safety at the steel mill, and a proper daddy&#39;s boy. But when he meets Yazmin, recently hired as a welder, all his shyness melts away. At first her straightforwardness irritates him, but soon her dark hair and full lips fill his world. When Love and Yazmin are alone in Love&#39;s office, the tension grows between them. But will they dare act on their feelings?" />
