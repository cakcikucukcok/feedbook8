  <title>How to Control Food Bills: The Diet for the Food Dollar Plan - Joy Wielland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book you will learn to follow The Plan and: o Eliminate register or budget balancing shock over food bills o Eliminate stress in food shopping o Always have a ready answer to;&quot;What&#39;s for dinner?&quot; o Always know exactly what food and kitchen supplies you have on hand o Eliminate expiration date&quot; casualties&quot; Ever look at your food bills and wonder where the money went? This book outlines a solution to that. As owner of a personal chef service, who bought retail, the author learned that to be able to quote a price to a client, maintain top quality and meet her bottom line, she had to be an informed shopper and organize her menus. She devised a plan and when she applied it to her personal grocery shopping, she found she had a total overview of her kitchen inventory, control of her expenses, and actually saved money. Friends who tried her method had the same results, whether they wanted just to keep track of expenses, control excess buying or to follow a budget. This proved the plan has value for all economic levels. It is truly one-size-fits-all because it&#39;s based on behavior modification rather than specific choices. By highlighting what was actually needed, it helped a woman adjust to being a widow and newlyweds to set and maintain a budget. The book contains step-by-step instructions, learning aids and tips to make the process easy. It also contains over 100 pages of charts and diagrams of meats, poultry, seafood cheeses, oils, grains and herbs and spices giving descriptions and suggested uses. There are lists temperature conversions, pan measurement, ingredient substitutions and calorie charts. These alone constitute a valuable kitchen tool COMMENTS FROM SOME READERS: The Plan helped me scale-back my grocery shopping when we became empty nesters and really saved a lot of stress and money. Gail P. Using your tips and following The Plan has removed the stress of food shopping. I actually enjoy it now! Nancy O. Thank you! The Plan requirement that she make and stick to a precise shopping list made my wife realize that she was way over buying and stretching our finances by coupon shopping rather than food shopping.
