  <title>Who’S Tending the Lambs &amp; Sheep of Jesus Christ? - Dr. Cora White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;\Father, we need you to ignite us by the fire that is in us that John promised that Jesus would bring into the believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we pray that the fire will spread like a wild fire within the hearts of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we pray that you forgive us for our complacency, arrogance, and our unwillingness to believe in the simplicity of your Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we ask that you tear down the wall of racism and denomination in the church, and help us to look inwardly for Christ in each other, instead of looking outwardly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we pray that you take us out of the four walls that we have imprisoned ourselves in and put us in the streets, neighborhoods, prisons, hospitals, cities, counties, nations, and throughout the Earth. We want to fulfill the great commission with all our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, let us no longer follow after signs and wonders, but help them to follow after us. Forgive us for the prostitution and fornication that we have done in your presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we know that your Holy Spirit is over your church today; help us to follow Him and to obey His leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, give us the ability to now work with the passion of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christ Jesus name, Amen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
