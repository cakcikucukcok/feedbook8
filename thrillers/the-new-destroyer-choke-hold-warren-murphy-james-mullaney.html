  <title>The New Destroyer: Choke Hold - Warren Murphy, James Mullaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pity poor tobacco tycoon Edgar Rawly.  Thanks to lawsuits, government meddling and the inexplicable deaths of many of his best customers, his megabucks industry is gasping its last breath.  That is, until the introduction of the Cheyenne Smooths, Rawly&#39;s latest product.  Not quite tobacco, not quite legal, more addictive than crystal meth.  Suddenly customers are once more beating a path to his door.  That&#39;s when the bodies start piling up.  Seems people are not only dying to taste the flavor of a Cheyenne Smooth, they&#39;re killing for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Remo Williams, the Destroyer, and Chiun, the deadly Master of Sinanju.  They&#39;ve been sent to kick some butt, but wind up in danger of being snuffed out themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out Edgar Rawly is not the only shady character to recognize the value of the Cheyenne Smooths, and things really start to heat up when Remo bumps into a cult of ancient Chinese assassins, an Asian crime lord, and a worldwide addiction that just might send civilization up in smoke...and dump the Destroyer on the ash heap of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
