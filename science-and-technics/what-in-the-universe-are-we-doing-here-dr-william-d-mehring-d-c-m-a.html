  <title>What in the Universe Are We Doing Here? - Dr. William D. Mehring D.C. M.A.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have You Ever Wondered? 
What happens to our thoughts, experiences and consciousness when we die?
Does God/Creation/The Great Mystery exist? If so, does It oversee our actions or have an agenda for the earth and humanitys outcome?
Are there multiple dimensions or realms, such as heaven, that co-exist with our world?
How does a global or even a universal consciousness help us to survive, heal and most importantly evolve?
Ultimately, is there a purpose for us to exist? If so what is that purpose?
Dr. Mehring brings new information to these fascinating questions in hopes of furthering the discussion of what truly exists and our purpose. He shares a combination of his experiences that he has had with unique individuals that have died and come back. Despite their previous critical condition they come back with an expanded awareness and clarity, and are willing to share their experience and the knowledge they have gained. Dr. Mehring will also share case histories and knowledge from several patients that have broken through to soul awareness during deep hypnosis. Dr. Mehring will also look to the new partnership between frontier science and ancient religious texts in an effort to authenticate and verify  that all he has witnessed is credible and will help humanity reach its greatest potential through knowing its purpose." />
