  <title>Franco&#39;s Crypt - Jeremy Treglown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An open-minded and clear-eyed reexamination of the cultural artifacts of Franco&#39;s Spain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;True, false, or both?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain&#39;s 1939-75 dictator, Francisco Franco, was a pioneer of water conservation and sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pedro Almodóvar is only the most recent in a line of great antiestablishment film directors who have worked continuously in Spain since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as 1943, former Republicans and Nationalists were collaborating in Spain to promote the visual arts, irrespective of the artists&#39; political views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Censorship can benefit literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory is not the same thing as history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside Spain as well as outside, many believe-wrongly-that under Franco&#39;s fascist dictatorship, nothing truthful or imaginatively worthwhile could be said or written or shown. In his groundbreaking new book, &lt;i&gt;Franco&#39;s Crypt: Spanish Culture and Memory Since 1936&lt;/i&gt;, Jeremy Treglown argues that oversimplifications like these of a complicated, ambiguous actuality have contributed to a separate falsehood: that there was and continues to be a national pact to forget the evils for which Franco&#39;s side (and, according to this version, his side alone) was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myth that truthfulness was impossible inside Franco&#39;s Spain may explain why foreign narratives (&lt;i&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Homage to Catalonia&lt;/i&gt;) have seemed more credible than Spanish ones. Yet La Guerra de España was, as its Spanish name asserts, Spain&#39;s own war, and in recent years the country has begun to make a more public attempt to &quot;reclaim&quot; its modern history of fascism. How it is doing so, and the role played in the process by notions of historical memory, are among the subjects of this wide-ranging and challenging book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Franco&#39;s Crypt&lt;/i&gt; reveals that despite state censorship, events of the time were vividly recorded. Treglown looks at what&#39;s actually there-monuments, paintings, public works, novels, movies, video games-and considers, in a captivating narrative, the totality of what it shows. The result is a much-needed reexamination of a history we only thought we knew.&lt;/p&gt;" />
