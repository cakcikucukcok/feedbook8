  <title>Terrific Melancholy - Roddy Lumsden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Roddy Lumsden&#39;s Terrific Melancholy is a book of changes, physical and emotional. It begins with a diverse sequence on that most dubious and folkloric of changes, rebirth into a new life, exploring our history&#39;s advances – changeless, changeful. Meanwhile, in the lengthy title-poem, an actor&#39;s reluctant crush on a younger colleague leads him to look back on life from middle age, while the poet himself does the same during travels in the USA. This is Lumsden&#39;s sixth collection and it also contains a miscellany of new poems which display the writer&#39;s acclaimed inventiveness with form and structure and his breadth of approaches: satire, listing, praise poems and a new form, the &#39;ripple poem&#39;, which develops the use of &#39;fuzzy&#39; rhyme. &#39;There is a level of talent that will ransom any project in any school. On the one hand, it will be interesting to see where Lumsden goes next; on the other, he&#39;s so good that it hardly matters&#39; – D.H. Tracy, Poetry. &#39;One of the best poets writing in English on the planet today&#39; – Don Share, Squandermania. &#39;Although the verse is hopping with linguistic antics, the foci of the language are music and rhetoric and, whip-smart as these poems are, they tend to resist chin-stroking analysis...the rhymes, the larks, the brutal punch-lines tug Lumsden&#39;s poems off the page and into the living context they describe&#39; – Matthew Smith, Verse.&lt;/div&gt;" />
