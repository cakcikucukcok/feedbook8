  <title>The Low Road - Karl J. Stenstrom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Low Road is a memoir of the life and exploits of a twenty-something  Boston City cab driver in the 70s and 80s.  This gritty yet humorous story targets audiences of a wide spectrum.  It is a must read for anyone who likes true crime, adventure, and a likable villain that triumphs over adversity, peppered with the seediness and debauchery of  inner city life.
The book places the reader in the shoes of a young man starting out in the world, alone, nave, and troubled.  Having no marketable skills but his cleverness and cunning, he carves out a living in a major city. He takes hold of what is his only opportunity in life and becomes more adept as time goes on, finally becoming a master at the game that once had him pinned. 
Native Bostonians, college students, and anyone with a perverse and pessimistic sense of humor will enjoy reading   The Low Road   because it is a fast paced, comical, and factual story of a true underdog who finally overcame." />
