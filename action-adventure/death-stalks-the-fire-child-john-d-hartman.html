  <title>Death Stalks the Fire Child - John D. Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death Stalks the Fire Child is the fourth and final book of the Fire Child series. In Return of the Fire Child, T.J. grudgingly accepts his destiny as the Fire Child, protector of the Inner World, a civilization located within the core of the Earth. Along with his three teen friends, Scott, Chad and Crash, he returns to the land of his birth to battle the evil that threatens not only his world, but also the surface world where he had been raised. Pursued by a Gorgon and her legion of cats, his friends soon learn that the Inner World is a land filled with strange creatures and dangerous beasts such as the boys had never imagined. 
In Quest of the Fire Child, T.J. seeks to establish himself as the protector of his world and faces new dangers from ruthless men and creatures that wish to destroy him. Once again he calls upon his three friends who, along with the wolf boy, Criton, risk their lives attempting to bring peace to a world in turmoil. It is during this time that T.J. learns that Scott is his half-brother and the bond between the two boys becomes stronger than ever as they see how their fates are intertwined. 
Fortress of the Fire Child finds T.J. and his friends facing further dangers in the form of Aquatis, a ruthless shape shifter who once battled the Fire Childs father and who seeks revenge against the son. Intrigue also continues as Mathias, T.J.s arch enemy, reappears and attempts to regain the throne of Stonemass, the chief city of the Inner World. Additional danger ensues as an army of mercenaries attempts to attack the Fortress, the home of the Fire Child. 
Now in Death Stalks the Fire Child, T.J. finds himself battling enemies on two separate fronts and he must rely upon the strength of his friends and their newly acquired powers to face one enemy while he faces the other. While Scott and the others hurry to protect Stonemass from a horde of mutant lizards, T.J. travels to the swampland to face the evil Slurpus who controls Liviatin, the most powerful creature the Fire Child has ever had to face." />
