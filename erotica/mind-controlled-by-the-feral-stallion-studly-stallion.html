&lt;br /&gt;
Just as she&amp;rsquo;s falling asleep, something whispers in her mind. Maybe she should wake the other watcher and alert him. But by then it was too late.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is where you tracked them?&amp;quot; Linda, a 19-year-old detective, viewed the scenic landscape of the vast ranch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yep.&amp;quot; The burly cowboy drawled, pushing back his hat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How?&amp;quot; Linda muttered more to herself than him, scanning the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; He kicked the ground. &amp;quot;All I know is that I hired three young women and they vanished.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They just abandoned their belongings?&amp;quot; The wheels in her mind were spinning. But she couldn&amp;#39;t find any answers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linda knew they had to have been kidnapped. But at night? Why? Who would have done this? What was the motive?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They slipped from their rooms, late at night and weren&amp;#39;t seen again.&amp;quot; He said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All three vanished here? Within weeks of each other?&amp;quot; Linda tapped her cheeks inspecting the tracks, which stopped at the pile of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yep.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll stay here tonight and see what happens.&amp;quot; Linda stated, knowing whatever happened to the ladies might happen to her, but she&amp;#39;d be ready.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll stay with you and see what happens. We&amp;#39;ll set up camp, because I want answers too.&amp;quot; His voice shook through her thoughts and she nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Soon, the full moon cast its silver light upon the land. SIlence filled the starry night. Linda sat on a rock before a crackling fire, watching and waiting on her shift, the cowboy snored in a sleeping bag a mere five feet away. She&amp;#39;d wake him if anything happened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was so peaceful out here and it was hard to think that there was anything wrong. She yawned, bored and sleepy and closed her eyes momentarily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Come to me. A voice suddenly rang in her head, compelling her to obey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shaking her head, she rose to her feet. She was definitely hearing things. Maybe she should wake him up and snatch some sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linda, however, only listened to the deep, masculine voice in her head, and forgot everything else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take off your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She obeyed. They fluttered to the ground as a large, powerful feral stallion silently emerged from the trees. He was dark brown and his eyes were so masterful she desired to do whatever he willed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pranced to her and reared on his hind legs as she trembled at his power. She panted as her heat rose within her like a slow burning fire." />
