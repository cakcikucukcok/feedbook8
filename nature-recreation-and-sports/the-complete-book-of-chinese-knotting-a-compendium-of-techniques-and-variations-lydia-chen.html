  <title>The Complete Book of Chinese Knotting: A Compendium of Techniques and Variations - Lydia Chen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Make intricate and beautiful Chinese knots with this traditional Chinese craft book.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chinese knotting, the joining of two cords to form symmetrical paterns, is an ancient and revered art form in China and an integral part of Chinese life.  Born first out of practical necessity in prehistoric times to bind materials for hunting, fishing, farming, shelters, communication and other inventions to aid production and convenience, Chinese knots were soon employed as decorative motifs on artifacts, both functional and ornamental, and for festive occasions and important rites of passage.  Today, more sophisticated designs, materials and applications have rejuvenated this colorful Chinese craft and have attracted a large following worldwide.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Complete Book of Chinese Knotting&lt;/I&gt; is the culmination of 20 years of research into the ancient art of Chinese knotting and macrame by renowned authority Lydia Chen. Inspired by the decorative knots embellishing ancient artifacts such as pots, jade, statuary, boxes and paintings, the author has systematically classified the basic knots, many almost forgotten, and their variations, as well as developed new knots using various knotting combinations and innovative materials.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In addition to a useful summary of the four major techniques for tying basic Chinese knots and the nine main ways of modifying them, the author introduces 56 brand new knots and creative designs which can be used to make jewelry, ornaments and stylish wardrobe and fashion additions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
