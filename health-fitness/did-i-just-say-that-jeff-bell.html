  <title>Did I Just Say That? - Jeff Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself wishing you would have waited another minute before clicking the send button on an email or hoped you could have snatched those words out of thin air before they reached their intended target? The Boston Globe reported women use 20,000 words a day and men 7,000. It was in 1839 when English author Edward Bulwer-Lytton coined the phrase The pen is mightier than the sword.  Spoken or written, words can lift up or tear down. What are you telling yourself? How do you speak to your spouse, your children, friends, and coworkers? How do you allow others to speak to you? The words you use to communicate verbally, in emails, text messaging, or through social media are powerful. They shape you and those around you. Reckless and negative words can spread like a cancer, literally destroying an individual, family, an organization, and even nations. In Did I Just Say That author Jeff Bell offers readers an insightful look at the influence of the words used in their life and he includes some practical steps to tame the muscle that controls much of your lifes outcome.&lt;p&gt;" />
