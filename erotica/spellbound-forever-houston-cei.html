      <meta name="description" content="Susan finally meets her soul-mate, a handsome, buffed Nigerian in the Marine Corps. It becomes a steamy interracial romance but later, he has second thoughts about a permanent relationship and Emily is called away to her coven for an indefinite period of time.

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a scotching August day as Susan and Robert made the five hour trek to Southern California. After checking into the motel, they proceeded to see the sites, the first of which was Disneyland. They especially enjoyed the wild rides as they both laughed together and sometimes Susan would scream. She remembered back when she and Lonny had their adventure in Honolulu and were certain that it was with love. Now here they were in the literal sense like children enjoying the wildest of rides. Susan was trying to forget about her loss of Lonny and likewise, Robert felt the same believing that he would never again see his wife, Emily. Then, they went to Huntington Beach where after a stroll on the sand, Robert rented a sailboat for a relaxing cruise to enjoy the evening sunset. All of this fun was like a major distraction from the disappointment of Emily&amp;#39;s departure and Lonny&amp;#39;s parting company with Susan. As time went by, it seemed like less and less of a struggle to forget their broken romances. The image of Lonny was no longer in Susan&amp;#39;s mind and likewise Robert was no longer haunted by the memory of Emily&amp;#39;s beauty and magic. The resentment of her leaving offset the emotional pain and the resentment was relaxing his guilt. Whenever the image of Emily did come to his mind, it was with the accompanying thought that she was gone for good. All her talk about love for this family and that she would return means nothing now. I will never fall in love again and I hope my daughter will likewise protect her heart, he thought, assuming that Emily would in fact, never return.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was still very warm this August afternoon as Susan and Robert were sailing just off the Coast of California, and he was in shorts and a tank top and she was in a bright red thong bikini. He could not keep his eyes off of her beautiful and shapely suntanned legs, especially whenever she crossed or uncrossed them. She noticed that her pretty legs were catching his eyes and in appreciation of the attention she said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m glad that you&amp;#39;re checking me out, it means you think I&amp;#39;m cute. Well, let me tell you this, you&amp;#39;re damn cute, too and there&amp;#39;s a lot of sexy looking people around this vacation spot that would like to meet us. What do ya say we get a little better acquainted with some of them, if ya know what I mean?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The beautiful, warm weather continued, and midway through their week long adventure they planned to go to the neighboring town of Buena Park to see the famous berry farm that has grown to be a fabulous amusement park. They had heard so much about it and Susan was overwhelmed with excitement. She had packed the skimpiest orange satin bikini she owned and she was inspired to wear it. Although she did not yet know with whom it would be she was now hoping for some intense love making. She thought to herself, I think some strange stuff will be a nice distraction for my dad and myself, a lot of fun, too.&amp;nbsp; She wanted to do everything she could to enhance the sexual activity that she just knew was waiting out there for them." />
