  <title>Invisible Prince - Frances Mahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She is a spirit of the past deeply infatuated with the imagination of her lost love. In her mind, she loves two men equally. One is her soul mate; the other has stolen her heart forever. She is torn apart by these unfamiliar emotions. These men, in a far Arab region of the Middle East, are unaware of the adoration of this older woman, yet she transforms their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loses her mind, and death comes and goes inside her soul as she dies and relives to love them again and again. In her journey, she loves her two men and hates them at the same time. This triangle goes on for the rest of her life. The two men even know each other. However, they do not meet this woman until one day, when their paths cross without them knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She communicates with both men at an emotional as well as visual level. She feels their presence and knows what they are doing at any given time. She tunes into this network through a medium of meditation, her abilities unlike any other human being. The communication doesnt stop with these two men, though. A third love comes to her attention, and a new communication begins.&lt;/p&gt;" />
