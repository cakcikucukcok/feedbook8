  <title>The One and the Many - Rabindranath Tagore, William Radice, Ketaki Kushari Dyson, John Berridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This elegant volume of Tagore&#39;s poems, translated, is copiously illustrated by colour photographs from John Berridge, Professor of Religion at Xavier University, Antigonish, Canada.
William Radice, who has translated Tagore for years, is a Professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. He is also a poet in his own right.
The second translator, Ketaki Kushari Dyson, was born in Calcutta in 1940 and educated at Calcutta and Oxford. In 1963 she became the first Indian woman to gain a First in English Literature at Oxford. She also has a doctorate from Oxford. Based in Britain since her marriage to an Englishman, she maintains close links with the literary life of her native city and is regarded as a significant Bengali writer of her generation." />
