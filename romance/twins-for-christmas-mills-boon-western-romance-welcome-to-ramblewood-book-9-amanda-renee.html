  <title>Twins For Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon Western Romance) (Welcome to Ramblewood, Book 9) - Amanda Renee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;ALL HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the moment they were born, Hannah Tanner fell completely in love with her best friend&#39;s twin girls. Then a terrible car crash leaves her their sole guardian. And before she can even get the twins settled, their biological father shows up at Hannah&#39;s door...determined to take her girls away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Noah Knight isn&#39;t leaving Ramblewood, Texas without his daughters, and Hannah isn&#39;t giving them up without a fight. Worse still, Noah can&#39;t deny her fierce love for the girls—or his own growing feelings for her. It’ll take more than a Christmas miracle to keep his new family together—he&#39;ll need to win Hannah&#39;s heart!&lt;/p&gt;
