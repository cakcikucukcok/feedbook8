  <title>Vienna and Venture - Anthony J. Liguori Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vienna and Venture are two horses that live the good life. Their home is called Anethonie Stables, and their owners, Annette and Anthony, take great care of them. But it wasnt always this way. The horses grew up somewhere else, close to their moms in a different stable. Leaving their birth homesand leaving their motherswas not easy; luckily, Annette and Anthony showered the young horses with love and made them feel at home.
One day, an awful old man named Mr. Crutch visits Anethonie Stables to take a look at Venture. He offers to buy the horse, but Anthony refuses, saying Venture is his horse for life. Mr. Crutch wont take no for an answer, though; in the dark of night, he tries to steal Venture. Venture and Vienna escape, and so begins their adventure out in the wild world!
&lt;i&gt;Vienna and Venture: Tales from the Equine Side&lt;/i&gt; is the journey of two brave horses, searching for their way homeback to Anethonie Stables. Even though theyre on the run, theyre often stopped by people and animals in trouble. Vienna and Venture try to do whats right, despite their own goal of getting homeand in so doing, become the great horses they were always meant to be!" />
