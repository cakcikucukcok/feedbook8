  <title>Hard to be Holy - Paul Whetham, Libby Whetham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;At last, an utterly honest book which recognises that the church is in crisis, and its pastors too... The authors&amp;rsquo; skills as interviewers are abundantly revealed in the sympathetic rapport they achieve with their subjects. This is an important book full of fruitful encouragement to take risks for God.&amp;rsquo; James Murray, Religious affairs editor &amp;ndash; The Australian &amp;lsquo;I cannot think of two people better placed to talk to us ministers about how &amp;lsquo;hard&amp;rsquo; it is to be &amp;lsquo;holy&amp;rsquo; without the sustenance of open and reciprocal friendships with the people of our congregations. For that is what they very cogently argue in this excellent book.&amp;rsquo; Rev Tim Costello AO &amp;ndash; Former CEO of World Vision &amp;lsquo;Hard to be Holy is a book that disturbs me greatly. In times of difficulty, at the very moment when leaders need the support of a Christian community, they tend to cut themselves off from a potential lifeline . . . A must read for all those in leadership and congregations in a changing Australia.&amp;rsquo; Dr Peter Kaldor, Director &amp;ndash; National Church Life Survey &amp;lsquo;Hard to be Holy changes the missional conversation. From how to find the silver bullet to grow the church, to how we can flourish as human beings so as to develop healthy God-centred relationships inside and outside the church. A must-read for anyone concerned about the future shape of Christian mission.&amp;rsquo; Dean Eaton, Mission Facilitator &amp;ndash; Lutheran Church of Australia&lt;/p&gt;" />
