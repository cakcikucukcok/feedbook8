  <title>An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge - Ambrose Bierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge is a short story by the American writer and Civil War veteran Ambrose Bierce. Regarded as &amp;quot;one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature&amp;quot; it was originally published by The San Francisco Examiner on July 13, 1890, and was first collected in Bierce&amp;#39;s book Tales of Soldiers and Civilians (1891). The story, which is set during the American Civil War, is known for its irregular time sequence and twist ending. Bierce&amp;#39;s abandonment of strict linear narration in favor of the internal mind of the protagonist is an early example of the stream of consciousness narrative mode.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The French director Robert Enrico won Best Short Subject at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, and the 1963 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film, for his 27-minute film, La Rivi&amp;egrave;re du hibou (1962), based on the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author Kurt Vonnegut wrote in 2005: &amp;quot;I consider anybody a twerp who hasn&amp;#39;t read the greatest American short story, which is &amp;#39;[An] Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,&amp;#39; by Ambrose Bierce. It isn&amp;#39;t remotely political. It is a flawless example of American genius, like &amp;#39;Sophisticated Lady&amp;#39; by Duke Ellington or the Franklin stove.&amp;quot;" />
