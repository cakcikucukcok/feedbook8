  <title>The &#39;Software&#39; of Your Personality: The Meaning and Purpose of  Life - Dr Ted Todd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Non fiction book examines human lives and actions, meaning and purpose. It offers easily understood concepts on all of them and on much more. We are all so called &amp;#39;programmed&amp;#39; from our birth and after.That is ok unless it is putting breaks on what we can achieve,think and feel. The book offers in easy language, practical tools to improve lives in every way. Using humor and seriously deep ideas this will challenge anyone&amp;#39;s understanding of what life is about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a reinvention of psyvhology and even philosophy, a re consioderation about wthere and what has worked for people of these sciences. Re conceptualizing your self is the first step, using and understanding metaphors, memory and what features every individual has is another big step. Personal change can be had and it can be not so hard, but one must&amp;nbsp; first have a good grip on what one truly wants to achieve whether in carreers or in private lives - or actually in both. Knowing what you really want is not easy; no accepting your pre programmed answers is already enlightening. Replacing your emotional progmrams and behaviours is also easier than one woul think, though it needs awareness and work. Everyone is pre programmed by one&amp;#39;s genes, parents, society and culture, and thats fine and it is necessary. Yet we are all carry much outdated software and ideology, all programs that need to be re considered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are various fun ways to change one&amp;#39;s life in small or great increments. Taking more control and making better choices is not something you were born with. You learned it and sometimes what you learned was not the best or most suitable way for the individual.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book is fun to read even as it challenges many beliefs, modes of operating and aims of life. There is no mystery about purpose and meaning. You can get a grip on all that without any up there out there ideology. Sane living start with seeing all the junk programs we carry and then need to be rid of.&lt;/p&gt;" />
