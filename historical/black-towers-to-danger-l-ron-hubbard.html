  <title>Black Towers to Danger - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Drilling for oil is a dirty business, and for Bill Murphy, it&amp;rsquo;s about to turn positively filthy. But Murphy&amp;rsquo;s a man in the mold of a young John Wayne, and he&amp;rsquo;s more than a match for everything Venezuela can throw at him. Everything, that is, except for Marcia Stewart. She&amp;rsquo;s convinced Murphy killed her father, and she wants revenge. Murphy&amp;rsquo;s drilling down for the truth, and it&amp;rsquo;s his land, his love for Marcia&amp;mdash;and his life&amp;mdash;that are on the line. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Black Towers to Danger was first published in 1936, the editor wrote: &amp;ldquo;L. Ron Hubbard, as you know, is a pilot, a writer and an engineer. The one thing he doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at is engineering. He was in China at 15 and has covered a lot of territory since then. If he&amp;rsquo;s on a flying field&amp;mdash;or anywhere else&amp;mdash;you can&amp;rsquo;t miss him&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;s a tall, slender chap with very fair skin and bright red hair. Something picturesque about him as there should be about a flyer.&amp;rdquo; And not only was he a man with a commanding presence, so too did he have command over his material, researching the entire oil drilling process for this story.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;quot;Roars to life.&amp;quot;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/B&gt; Publishers Weekly&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
