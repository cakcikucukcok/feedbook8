  <title>The Negotiator - HelenKay Dimon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lauren Gallagher&amp;#8217;s life changed almost three years ago. After her husband disappeared at sea, she was left with a failing pleasure boat company and more than a few secrets. Now, after years spent rebuilding the business and paying off the pile of debts, she finally feels in control. But when she finds her husband, actually dead, on the floor, she becomes the leading suspect in his murder investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garrett McGrath wants Lauren in his bed, not his heart. He doesn&amp;#8217;t do emotions, but every time he sees her, holding himself back gets harder and harder. When Lauren comes under suspicion for killing her previously presumed-dead husband, he knows he has to help her, any way he can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the danger becomes more intense and Garret and Lauren grow closer than either planned, they&amp;#8217;re in danger of losing everything&amp;#8230;including their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
