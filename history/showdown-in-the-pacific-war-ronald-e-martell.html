  <title>Showdown in the Pacific War - Ronald E. Martell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Showdown in the Pacific War: Nimitz and Yamamoto
This unique book combines a carefully researched history with an easy to read analysis of the war in a fictional meeting between staff officers close to Admirals Chester Nimitz and Isoroku Yamamoto. They trace the events leading to the Pacific War and the heroic struggles following the attack on Pearl Harbor to the eclipse of the Japanese war machine at Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, and beyond. Showdown reveals Yamamotos opposition to Japans waging a war it could not win along with his planning of her early successes and Admiral Nimitzs patient and careful reversal of the Empires offensives. Showdown presents an even-handed view of the nations that waged combat in the early stages of historys most famous naval war. 
Ron Martell has given us a new and very interesting look at World War II in the Pacific. Instead of simply retelling history, he puts the reader in a fictitious yet plausible latter-day conference between two of the conflicts high-ranking adversaries, key staff officers of the American and Japanese navies.. . . Its a genuine page-turner for any fan of World War II history.  
Ronald Russell, author of No Right to Win: A Continuing Dialogue with Veterans of the Battle of Midway.
Showdown in the Pacific is a thoroughly enjoyable read. . . . If someone asks me for a single book to read on how the Pacific War started and then was fought for the first 18 months, I will heartily recommend this one.
