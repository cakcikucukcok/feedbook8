  <title>On Learning Golf: A Valuable Guide to Better Golf - Percy Boomer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Golf has been the subject of so much writing that Percy Boomer is to be congratulated on developing some original thoughts on the popular pastime. Although no game has produced more theories or evoked a greater divergence of opinion as to the methods of its teaching, I believe even the author&amp;rsquo;s sternest critics will admit that he has achieved a pleasing combination of humour with plenty of good golf sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is in no way Percy Boomer&amp;rsquo;s fault that I have not yet discovered the elusive secret, and it has to be as a disciple of the game and not as a low-handicap player that I recommend On Learning Golf, in the hope that it will help to reduce its readers&amp;rsquo; scores and discourage their opponents." />
