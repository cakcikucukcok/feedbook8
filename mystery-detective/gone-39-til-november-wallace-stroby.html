  <title>Gone &#39;til November - Wallace Stroby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s late at night when Florida sheriff&#39;s deputy Sara Cross arrives at the scene of a roadside shooting along a deserted highway. Another deputy, Billy Flynn, her former partner, who also happens to be her former lover, has fatally shot a twenty-two-year-old man during what started out as a routine traffic stop, and she&#39;s the first to arrive on the scene. He claims that the man pulled a gun, and that when he didn&#39;t respond to Billy&#39;s commands to drop it, Billy shot him. Billy is clearly upset, shaken up; Sarah sees the gun in the dead man&#39;s hand and the bag of illegal weapons in the trunk of his car and believes Billy&#39;s actions were justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up north in New Jersey, Mikey-Mike runs a major drug operation and is tightening his hold on the competition, making a deal with a new supplier. Morgan, a middle-aged enforcer for Mikey who&#39;s been in the life too long, would like to make one last score, walk away, and retire for good. Mike asks Morgan to head to Florida to find out what&#39;s holding up his new deal, and Morgan sees the job as a possibility for his last big payday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more details of the roadside shooting emerge with Sara&#39;s investigation, and as Morgan follows the trail Mikey lays out for him, the two storylines begin to merge into a much darker, more menacing scenario than either Morgan or Sara imagined. Sara, in order to protect herself and her son, must follow the truth no matter where it leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed crime writer Wallace Stroby delivers a gripping novel in &lt;i&gt;Gone &#39;til November&lt;/i&gt; that is part modern noir, part intense character study---and totally compelling from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;" />
