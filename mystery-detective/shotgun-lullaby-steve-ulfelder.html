  <title>Shotgun Lullaby - Steve Ulfelder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From critically acclaimed, Edgar-nominated author Steve Ulfelder-Conway Sax is back in a thrilling and heart-wrenching story of how far a father will go to save his son&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conway Sax is a man seeking redemption.  A man with a deeply checkered past currently paying for his sins by helping Gus Biletnikov stay sober. Wise-ass Gus, son of a wealthy investment banker, drives Conway nuts. But he also reminds him of his own estranged son, and so Conway finds himself deeply invested in his wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a brutal triple-murder takes place in Gus&#39;s halfway house, Conway suspects Gus was the intended victim, and resolves to find the killer in his usual full-tilt, no-holds-barred fashion. The list of suspects soon includes the longtime organized-crime warlord of Springfield, Massachusetts; Gus&#39;s own father, who&#39;s a bundle of insecurity despite his fortune; the father&#39;s second wife, a stunning beauty webbed in ugly motives; and a Houston con man who&#39;ll swipe your gold fillings but crack you up while he does so.  But the case is no laughing matter to Conway when somebody close to him is murdered. To find the killer and prevent yet more senseless death, he needs help from both an ambitious Brazilian-American state cop, and an unlikely criminal source. Along the way, Conway&#39;s personal responsibilities clash with his vow to help fellow alcoholics, forcing him to make his toughest decision yet in this unforgettable page-turner reminiscent of Robert B. Parker and Dennis Lehane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shotgun Lullaby&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;This action-packed story moves lightning fast, and Sax makes an appealingly damaged protagonist. Dennis Lehane and Robert B. Parker fans will enjoy Ulfelder.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gritty, intense, completely original. Ulfelder nails the voice, nails the story, and pushes Conway Sax, his unforgettable main character, beyond his breaking point. &lt;i&gt;Shotgun Lullaby&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a page-turner of a mystery-it&#39;s a masterful study of a good guy gone bad, and his heart-breaking struggle to be good again.&quot; --Hank Phillippi Ryan  Agatha, Anthony &amp; Macavity winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Other Woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Steve Ulfelder is one of the most street-smart authors writing crime fiction today. &lt;i&gt;Shotgun Lullaby&lt;/i&gt; is a thrill ride that hits the gas hard on page one and races all the way to a heart-pounding finish.&quot; -Paul Doiron, author of &lt;i&gt;Bad Little Falls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Shotgun Lullaby&lt;/i&gt; is exactly as tough, and exactly as full of heart, as the title suggests.
