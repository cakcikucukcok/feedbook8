      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;A married woman&amp;rsquo;s affair makes her reconsider the nature of love in this &amp;ldquo;beautiful, wise novel&amp;rdquo; (Edmund White).&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Maria Jameson is having an affair&amp;mdash;a passionate, life-changing affair. Yet she wonders whether this has to mean an end to the love she shares with her husband.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; For answers to the question of whether it is possible to love two men at once, she reaches across the centuries to George Sand, the maverick French novelist. Immersing herself in the life of this revolutionary woman who took numerous lovers, Maria struggles with the choices women make, and wonders if women in the nineteenth century might have been more free, in some ways, than their twenty-first-century counterparts.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; As these two narratives intertwine&amp;mdash;following George through her affair with Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Chopin, following Maria through her affair with an Irish professor&amp;mdash;this novel explores the personal and the historical, the demands of self and the mysteries of the heart.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;This is not so much a story about having a love affair as it is a study of the nature of love itself. I was absolutely knocked out by it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Elizabeth Berg&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
