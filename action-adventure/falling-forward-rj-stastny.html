  <title>Falling Forward - Rj Stastny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wes, a romantic and accomplished gay man in his forties, thinks that he has his life in order. He has been in a relationship for years, and he is confident that he knows what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when his partner dies suddenly, Wes finds himself falling forward into a future filled with grief, uncertainty, and untapped potential. Now Wes must fight to regain his equilibrium and build a new life in a new citywhile somehow holding on to the stability of his lost past. A robust yet disparate group of friends, lovers, and acquaintances become his guides on a new series of international escapades in which Wes finds himself uncompromisingly involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Falling Forward&lt;/i&gt; is an anthem for the positive acceptance of change in an uncertain world. Wes is now forced to acknowledge that his life is built upon little twists of fate and choices. Ultimately, Wes must decide if he is one of those brave adventurers willing to achieve the highs of finding love, even at the cost of possibly losing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling Forward is for anyone who enjoys a well thought out story, and likes to read about characters that are a delight to spend time with.&lt;br&gt;
