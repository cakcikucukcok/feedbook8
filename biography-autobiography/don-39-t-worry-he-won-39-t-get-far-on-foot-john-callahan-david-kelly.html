  <title>Don&#39;t Worry, He Won&#39;t Get Far on Foot - John Callahan, David Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&amp;#160;a major motion picture directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jonah Hill, and Rooney Mara&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featuring more than 60 of Callahan&#39;s original cartoons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;When people laugh like hell and then say, &amp;#8216;That&amp;#8217;s not funny,&amp;#8217; you can be pretty sure they&amp;#8217;re talking about John Callahan.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;P.J. O&amp;#8217;Rourke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1972, at the age of 21, John Callahan was involved in a car crash that severed his spine and made him a quadriplegic. A heavy drinker since the age of 12 (alcohol had played a role in his crash), the accident could have been the beginning of a downward spiral. Instead, it sparked a personal transformation. After extensive physical therapy, he was eventually able to grasp a pen in his right hand and make rudimentary drawings. By 1978, Callahan had sworn off drinking for good, and begun to draw cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next three decades, until his death in 2010, Callahan would become one of the nation&amp;#8217;s most beloved&amp;#8212;and at times polarizing&amp;#8212;cartoonists. His work, which shows off a wacky and sometimes warped sense of humor, pokes fun at social conventions and pushes boundaries. One cartoon features Christ at the cross with a thought bubble reading &amp;#8220;T.G.I.F.&amp;#8221; In another, three sheriffs on horseback approach an empty wheelchair in the desert. &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry,&amp;#8221; one sheriff says to another, &amp;#8220;He won&amp;#8217;t get far on foot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Worry, He Won&amp;#8217;t Get Far on Foot&lt;/em&gt; recounts Callahan&amp;#8217;s life story, from the harrowing to the hilarious. Featuring more than 60 of Callahan&amp;#8217;s cartoons, it&amp;#8217;s a compelling look at art, addiction, disability, and fame. A film adaptation scheduled for 2018, starring Joaquin Phoenix as John Callahan, will bring fresh attention to this underappreciated classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
