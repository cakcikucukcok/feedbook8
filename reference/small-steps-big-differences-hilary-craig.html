  <title>Small Steps, Big Differences - Hilary Craig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each one of us learns in a different way.  Traditional teaching approaches dont always suit the variety of different ways people learna conflict that can damage confidence and sometimes lead to failure.  The key question that faces parents and teachers is how to help those who learn differently find long term success.  In Small Steps, Big Differences: A Toolkit for Parents of Children Who Fall through the Cracks, author Hilary Craig challenges this question and offers parents strategies to help.  
The resources provided within this toolkit are framed around the core belief that all children can make progress, even if traditional learning and teaching methods in the classroom are inadequate for the way they learn. This toolkit provides support to those parents who recognize the unique abilities and talents in their children and who want practical tools to enable them to learn and succeed.  Hilary Craigs experience, insight and strategies for helping children learn effectively, provide a valuable resource to accompany classroom learning. In this toolkit, she also addresses the four essential skills for effective learning: memory, listening, attention, and social skills; and strategies to develop each of these, with the final goal to build confidence.
Small Steps, Big Differences is an invaluable resource for parents to help their children increase their chances for learning success." />
