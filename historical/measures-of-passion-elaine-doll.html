  <title>Measures of Passion - Elaine Doll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kristina Soderlund is the daughter of an Oklahoma cotton farmer with a passion for music. Although her parents have mapped out a traditional life for her, she has bigger dreamsdreams of music, art, and beauty; of a university education; and of leaving the farm far behind to open a music studio in Oklahoma City. But for a single woman in 1905, those dreams are unlikely to come true. Even so, she is determined that nothing will get in her way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when she befriends Pilan&#39; Rousseau, a handsome French-Indian traveler, her resolve weakens. Despite the warnings of her parents and friends, Kristina soon loses her heart to the charming stranger. But fate is not on her side: Pilan&#39; has no plans of staying in Oklahoma City. Hes simply passing through on his own journey across America. An accomplished violinist with an intense passion for dance, he dreams of returning to Paris to open his own ballroom dance studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristinas life has never been easy, but now she faces more challenges than ever. Her hopes of love with Pilan&#39; are crushed when he leaves town. Heartbroken, she leaves Oklahoma and all of its pain behind her and heads to Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against seemingly impossible circumstances, both Kristina and Pilan&#39; discover that their passions for music and dance are too great to ignore. But fate has torn them apart. Each will pursue their dreams, but will they be satisfied by ambitionor love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
