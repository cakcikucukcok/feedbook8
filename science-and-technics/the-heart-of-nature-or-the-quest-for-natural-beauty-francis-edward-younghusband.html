  <title>The Heart of Nature - Or, The Quest for Natural Beauty - Francis Edward Younghusband</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This vintage book contains Francis Younghusband&#39;s 1921 work, &quot;The Heart Of Nature&quot;. In this text Younghusband analyses the meaning of beauty through anecdotal experiences, descriptions of nature, and explorations of the human condition. Highly recommended for lovers of nature and travel writing, this volume would make for a worthy addition to any personal collection, and constitutes a must-read for fans of Younghusband&#39;s work. The chapters of this book include: &quot;The Sikkim Himalaya&quot;, &quot;The Teesta Valley&quot;, &quot;The Forest&quot;, &quot;The Denizens of the Forest&quot;, &quot;The Sum Impression&quot;, &quot;Kinchinjunga&quot;, &quot;High Solitudes&quot;, &quot;The Heavens&quot;, &quot;Home Beauty&quot;, &quot;The Nature of Nature&quot;, &quot;Nature&#39;s Ideal&quot;, etcetera. Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Edward Younghusband (1863 - 1942) was an officer in the British Army, as well as an explorer and author. He is most famous for his writings on Asia and foreign policy. Many old works such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
