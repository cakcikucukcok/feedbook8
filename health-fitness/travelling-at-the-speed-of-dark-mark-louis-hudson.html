  <title>Travelling at the Speed of Dark - Mark Louis Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, is essentially about HOW
I have survived
STUPID
For many and nearly
60 odd years.
More often than not, the truth hurts.
But it is what it is, and I am HOW I am.
What you are about to read, is all completely true, as I have lived it, first hand, and have survived it to tell.
MY LIFE
I have heard all of my life, not to judge a book by its cover.
As I have judged, I too have also been judged. Either way, does not work out so well, in the end.
But I am here to tell you, as far as my picture is concerned, on the front cover of this book, you get exactly what you see.
Nothing is hidden, not even in the book.
I put myself out there for all the world to see. And I am afraid that all you get, is plain ole silly, and God fearing, and undeniably lucky me.
I will attempt to show you, how it is that I see, from my differing view,
through a few of my true-life stories.
And then maybe you will begin to see, why I am, HOW I am, and why I do as I do.
Like it or not, this is all that I am. You get what you see, and you see what you get.
It is all true, and it is definitely, truly,
the epitome of me.
Mark L. Hudson" />
