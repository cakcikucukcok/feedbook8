  <title>The Lost Key - Ebrahim Soufiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr Soufiani, founder and director of a civil engineering firm in London, is a London University PhD qualified and practising civil and environment engineer. He was researcher at University of London, research assistant at University of East London, and lecturer at Iran University of Science &amp; Technology.
Soufianis passion about Persian literature has steered him to over ten years of extensive research with a great Persian philosopher, Manuchehr Jamali. Jamali has managed to open up many incredible doors to him in comprehending Persian literature to its true meaning of values, love, unity, and dignity.
Soufianis understanding of Eastern and Western cultures has given him a great leverage in his exploration of Persian literature in comparison with Western civilization and the lack of democracy in the Middle East. With this book, he highlights Persian literature as an invaluable asset and the lost key in opening the lock of the declining morality in our modern world and the absence of democracy in the Middle East.
The world must sincerely assist in exploration of this nations literature for the sake of morality. The Middle East must explore and use her own invaluable potential rich literature to rise and fl y from her own ashes to establish the ethical society that will give them the tools for building and establishing the foundation of a democratic system.
Many Persian poems have been translated throughout this book to highlight the core values of beautiful Persian romantic and humanistic culture." />
