  <title>Silent Reckoning (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Bombshell, Book 37) - Debra Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Who ever heard of a deaf detective?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A year ago, my dream had seemed impossible. But I, Merri Walters, had used my lip-reading skill to bring down criminals and had scored a job with Metro Police. Earning my detective&#39;s badge took guts and nerve, which I had plenty of. Now a serial killer was on the loose, targeting beautiful, wannabe country stars, and I was lead on the hottest case in town.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, the man I lusted after was now my boss, and his overprotectiveness was cramping my style. Still, no one could have predicted that I&#39;d become the killer&#39;s next target–or that my supposed weakness would be the weapon I needed to survive….&lt;/p&gt;
