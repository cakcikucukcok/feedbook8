  <title>Dreams Truths Secrets - Orlando Rivera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After Jack Kingsley lost his business, the last thing he wanted to hear was the slamming of the door behind his beloved wife as she walked out, saying, I didnt marry you to struggle, Jack Kingsley. With his life unraveling, Jack returns to New Eden Park, where he spent many wonderful days growing up. Perhaps by going back to this place where his life had started with so much promise, he could recapture a new direction and purpose to his existence. Trying very hard to keep hold of his sanity shortly after arriving at the park, Jack meets Mrs. Barbara Bailey, who offers him some hope and wisdom by sharing her triumph over tragic experiences of her own. But it is Mrs. Barbara Baileys exit and what she seems to have left behind that delivers an introduction to the strangest of experiences. 
Little did Jack know that a conversation with money, literally, would hold so many of lifes secrets and the key to his own victory over adversity and misfortune. Everything in Jacks life begins to change as he speaks to Fifty, a fifty-dollar bill. Jack experiences his own inner awakening and self-discovery as he listens and watches as the most unconventional of characters becomes his guide and counselor. Fifty unveils a unique and creative perspective of human behavior, happiness, fulfillment, and successful living from moneys vantage point. Fifty speaks to Jack and reveals the Code of Truths for money and life through a series of simple but profound stories that will serve as a guide to steer him in the right direction and hopefully into successful living. Finally, of a new mind, Jack sets out to claim a second chance at life. 
In many ways, Jack Kingsley is all of us. The pursuit of happiness through a great education, a great job or business, a fabulous mate, and lofty financial dreams are all but a part of who we are as individuals. Unfortunately, Jack, like many of us, finds himself in a precarious financial situation, in a family on the verge of collapse, and in disbelief as to how it all got to this point. For many of us, what started out as a promising life unfolds disappointingly as we settle for an existence below our expectations. Dreams Truths Secrets is a book about the eternal truths that are available to us, waiting to be discovered, and how to understand them and use them to achieve fulfillment and balance in our lives. 
Fifty takes Jack and walks him through the mistakes he has made and provides for him the Code of Truths to teach him that not all is lost. Fifty explains to Jack that his life could be turned around and his financial goals could be achieved if he is only willing to change and learn that life is a great teacher and that mistakes are our allies that serve as lessons on our pathway to fulfillment. Fifty is the wise and loving voice that all of us could use here and now." />
