  <title>A is for Allegro - Roy McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A nostalgic A–Z of the most special and well-remembered 60s, 70s and 80s cars, with stylish illustrations accompanied by warm, humorous personal memories.
Designer and illustrator Roy McCarthy explores the cars that made a big impression on him in his younger days, from the sludge-coloured, disappointing Austin Allegro his father brought home in 1975 to the Ford Zephyr he coveted from afar on the way to school.
The evocative, colourful illustrations form a visual feast of late 20th-century driving, featuring all the cars drivers of a certain age will remember: the Hillman Imp, the Triumph Dolomite, the Opel Kadett, the Renault 5, and even the lowly Yugo 45 – a whole alphabet’s worth, in fact!
The perfect gift for anyone who’s ever owned, been driven around in or hankered after one of these motoring icons." />
