  <title>Stephen Jay Gould: Reflections on His View of Life - Patricia Kelley, Robert Ross, Warren D. Allmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Considered by many during his lifetime as the most well-known scientist in the world, Stephen Jay Gould left an enormous and influential body of work. A Harvard professor of paleontology, evolutionary biology, and the history of science, Gould provided major insights into our understanding of the history of life. He helped to reinvigorate paleontology, launch macroevolution on a new course, and provide a context in which the biological developmental stages of an organisms embryonic growth could be integrated into an understanding of evolution. This book is a set of reflections on the many areas of Goulds intellectual life by the people who knew and understood him best: former students and prominent close collaborators. Mostly a critical assessment of his legacy, the chapters are not technical contributions but rather offer a combination of intellectual bibliography, personal memoir, and reflection on Goulds diverse scientific achievements. The work includes the most complete bibliography of his writings to date and offers a multi-dimensional view of Goulds life-work not to be found in any other volume." />
