  <title>Finding Inner Courage - Mark Nepo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Mark Nepo has been interviewed by Oprah on her &lt;I&gt;Soul Series&lt;/I&gt; radio network and his &lt;I&gt;The Book of the Awakening&lt;/I&gt; has been featured in &lt;I&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine&lt;/I&gt; and on the Oprah TV show. In this book, Mark invites readers to explore their own inner core through the stories of ordinary people, political activists, artists, spiritual teachers from a variety of traditions. These are people who have faced themselves, their warts and weaknesses. They have stood by the courage of their convictions in all kinds of moments, great and small. Nepo&amp;#8217;s insights and commentary are spot on, and help readers relate the stories of others to their own lives. The book is divided into three sections--finding our inner core, standing by our inner core, and sustaining the practice of living from that place. Each of the nearly 60 brief essays and stories elucidates and inspires. Nepo&amp;#8217;s broad range of stories and people, of traditions and insights, offers myriad ways for readers to relate to their own search for courage. The late Howard Zinn said of this book, &amp;#8220;A poetic, profoundly thoughtful rumination on how we might live.&amp;#8221; *This book was originally published by Conari Press in 2007 under the title &lt;I&gt;Facing the Lion, Being the Lion&lt;/I&gt;. &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
