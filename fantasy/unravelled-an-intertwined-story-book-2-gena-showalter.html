  <title>Unravelled (An Intertwined Story, Book 2) - Gena Showalter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;&quot;Since coming to Crossroads, Oklahoma, former outcast Aden Stone has been living the good life. Never mind that one of his best friends is a werewolf, his girlfriend is a vampire princess who hungers for his blood, and he&#39;s supposed to be crowned Vampire King—while still a human! Well, kind of.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With four—oops, three now—human souls living inside his head, Aden has always been &quot;&quot;different&quot;&quot; himself. These souls can time-travel, raise the dead, possess another&#39;s mind and, his least favorite these days, tell the future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The forecast for Aden? A knife through the heart. Because a war is brewing between the creatures of the dark, and Aden is somehow at the center of it all. But he isn&#39;t about to lie down and accept his destiny without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not when his new friends have his back, not when Victoria has risked her own future to be with him, and not when he has a reason to live for the first time in his life. . . . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
