  <title>The Roots of the Mountains -  William Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Roots of the Mountains&amp;quot; is a novel by William Morris, which follows the Gothic theme from its predecessor, &amp;quot;The House of the Wolfings&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many years after the events of &amp;quot;The House of the Wolfings&amp;quot; the descendants of the Wolfing tribe live on the mountains dispersed in smaller tribes and mostly ignorant of their past. A new danger, this time the Huns, will unite them once more and force them to war in order to defend their freedom and way of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the second, and last, of Morris&amp;rsquo;s novels with a strong historic background. The descendants of the Wolfings live simple lives in a world of less magic and poetry than their ancestors. The story here is more complex as it follows the reunification of the tribes under a common threat. It is written almost entirely in prose with only a few songs. Once again Morris writes in his unique style immersing us in a unique tapestry of war and love embellished with fine details of nature, landscape and ancient customs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings&amp;quot; was influenced by this tale of a romance that unites two long-ago peoples and of the battle to defend their freedom against invading Huns.&lt;br /&gt;
Tolkien fans who long for more of the same delight that they get from &amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings&amp;quot; will find it in the writings of William Morris, for he created the literary style that J. R. R. Tolkien brought to such perfection in his tales." />
