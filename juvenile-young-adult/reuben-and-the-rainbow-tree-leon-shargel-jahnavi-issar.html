He decides to sneak away from his mother while she is asleep. Reuben jumps from one branch to another branch and then jumps againbut then he misses the tree branch and begins to fall! Can the Rainbow Tree rescue Reuben?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this childrens story, a small monkey named Reuben ignores his mother, jumps from branch to branch in the Rainbow Tree, and fallslearning a valuable lesson in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
