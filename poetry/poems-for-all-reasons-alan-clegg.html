  <title>Poems for All Reasons - Alan Clegg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Blacksmith 
The blacksmith by his anvil, his hammer in his hand. 
He beats a merry rhythm upon the hardened steel. 
Tap, tap, it bounces, up and down, a clear shrill note as old as time.

The Language of Flowers 
A wish: A cry from the heart 
A dream: A longing for something good 
A care: For something lovely 
Gary the Grasshopper

All he wanted to do was to fly and fly. 
Around and around, and up and down he goes, 
he bangs off the ceiling and hurts his poor nose.
