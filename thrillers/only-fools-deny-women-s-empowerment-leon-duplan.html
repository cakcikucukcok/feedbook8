  <title>Only Fools Deny Women’S Empowerment - Leon Duplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel describes how for centuries women have been submitted to various mistreatments and discriminations by men and that unfortunately many of them still prevail today. The goals of women today are directed to fight for their freedom, and to displace men from the pedestal where they have lived for a long time.
On May 16, 2010, the same date when Richard Solaris is informed of his fathers death, Pope Leon XVII died in Rome, and one cardinal and two bishops were kidnapped. As well, two car bombs exploded, one in Shanghai China, and another in New Delhi, killing and injuring several innocent people.   
Richard Solaris travels to Los Angeles in California to find out the real reason for his fathers death. The detective Samuel Lewis of the Los Angeles Police Department believes behind his fathers death can be an international organization, so he transfers the case to the Transnational Intelligence Police Agency (TIPA), where his friend Raymond Sullivan holds the position of General Director. Sullivan designates as responsible for the investigation an unmarried experienced detective of name Albert Colliere, who has solved all his cases except one, the crash of a plane where the Secretary of State of France has died.
Coming back from Los Angeles Richard recalls the letter his father left for him with the promise not to open until his demise. Opening the letter Richard is aware of facts that not only put his fathers integrity in doubt, but served to Colliere as the first clues to discover a womens organization, whose leaders were two women who in their youth suffered from mistreatment and discrimination by men, and that made the promise to destroy mens supremacy and helped women to climb into the ecclesiastical power always they say deserved by her. Colliere draws an ingenious plan to infiltrate in their organization a nun as a spy. What was found becomes shocking and terrifying." />
