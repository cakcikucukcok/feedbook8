      <meta name="description" content="The book titled &#39;Six Gun Justice&#39; is a fictional account of the life of the main character, Jim&lt;BR&gt;Vogt. The story begins with Jim and his father are off hunting and a tragedy happens to his&lt;BR&gt;mother and brother. A group of evil men rapes and murders the mother and takes Jim&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;young brother Peter off to sell into slavery. Jim is sent to his uncle Martin to live, while the&lt;BR&gt;father tries to track down the evil men. Fifteen years later, while living in Texas, tragedy&lt;BR&gt;again strikes Jim&#39;s loved ones. His pregnant wife is raped and murdered and he sets out on&lt;BR&gt;a trail of revenge. It takes a long time, but he tracks down the criminals and metes out his&lt;BR&gt;own brand of justice on them. On his travels he meets and falls in love, and meets someone&lt;BR&gt;who knows his brother. He settles down with his new wife and one day his long lost brother&lt;BR&gt;appears at his door. He stays with Jim for a period of time. He then sets out on his own and&lt;BR&gt;marries. He takes on the job of sheriff. He has some trouble with a local rancher and calls&lt;BR&gt;on Jim for help. Peter and his wife then travel to California. At this time Jim receives a&lt;BR&gt;letter from his long missing father, who happens to live in California. Jim is able to contact&lt;BR&gt;both his father and brother and arranges for them to return back to his ranch. The family&lt;BR&gt;is reunited and a new generation of&#39;Vogts&#39; is started.&lt;BR&gt;" />
