  <title>The Book of Uncommon Prayer - Steven Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do you need this book? Because there are treasures in tradition. In stark contrast to the common belief that youth workers require nothing less than a light show, smoke machine, and sweaty punk-rock band to reach teenagers&#39; souls, more and more youth have actually been moving toward depth and quiet--and away from fluff and noise. Creeds, candles, silence, and ancient spiritual practices are all gaining understanding and popularity among students who&#39;re passionately seeking otherworldly and mysterious fragrances. They&#39;re realizing that there are treasures in tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Uncommon Prayer&lt;/em&gt; is your tool for unearthing, dusting off, and tapping into these treasures--but in ways that are completely contemporary and, more importantly, completely relevant to students. It&#39;s personal. The prayers and worship services inside are written for youth ministry--for students and for youth workers! They tell the from-the-gut truth about what you and your kids face every day--and in language that won&#39;t leave anybody scratching their heads. It&#39;s practical. These tools are for just about any situation you can think of. Need a prayer for a lock-in? For family? For loving enemies? For final exams? How about a mind-blowing &quot;Dumpster&quot; Christmas service? An eye-opening service for All Hallows Eve? Or the most intense service for Good Friday you&#39;ve ever experienced? They&#39;re all here--along with many other innovative vehicles for bringing your students into communion with God. It&#39;s unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for all denominations. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re mainline or evangelical, Protestant or Catholic; &lt;em&gt;The Book of Uncommon Prayer&lt;/em&gt; is geared for all teenagers and youth workers in Jesus&#39; church! There&#39;s also an entire section of devotions and prayers written specifically for you, the youth worker, to renew and strengthen you when times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mysterious. Practical. Treasure-filled. (Yes, uncommon, too!) &lt;em&gt;The Book of Uncommon Prayer&lt;/em&gt; is a rich source of God-revealing worship and a one-of-a-kind guide for personal renewal that youth workers, camp counselors, Sunday school teachers, adult volunteers (and even students) will love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
