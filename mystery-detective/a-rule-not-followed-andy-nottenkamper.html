  <title>A Rule Not Followed - Andy Nottenkamper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bud Wheeler lives in a small town in the backwoods of Arkansas, but that doesnt automatically make him a simple farmer. As a sideline, Bud is an options trader in the stock market, and somehow hes managed to make millions within just six months. It seems the young man &lt;i&gt;just knows&lt;/i&gt; precisely when to make a tradealmost as if hes got an unbeatable system. Maybe he does, which is why the Securities and Exchange Commission decides to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a favor for his old friend and adversary, Brunswick Bohlman, Harrison Pius heads to Arkansas to look into the Wheeler situation. He discovers that the government isnt the only party interested; Bud and his wife, Sue, have some shady characters sniffing around their property, too. Harry should have known there was more to Wheeler than meets the eye, and as usual, anything involving Bohlman quickly turns deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon theres murder on the table, and Harry has a baffling case on his hands that even stumps the FBI. Betrayal soon seasons the case, as does unexpected romance for Harry. So what is Wheelers secret investment strategy? And does Bohlman really care about his distant relative Bud Wheeler, or did Harry get set up for the biggest fall of his life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
