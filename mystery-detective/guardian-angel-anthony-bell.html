  <title>Guardian Angel - Anthony Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Aufero gets punished in Heaven he discovers a side of Heaven he never knew existed.  In his attempt to get back in the good graces of God, he discovers love, an awkward partnership, and his dark side.  Satan has discovered a new way to defeat the guardian angels and is eager to take the throne of God for himself.  Determined to change the course of battle Aufero guides his fellow angels into a battle meant to change Satan&#39;s mind about attacking the Gates of Heaven.  The battle doesn&#39;t go as planned and the object of Aufero&#39;s affection (Aphasia) is abducted and taken to Hell.  Now against the wishes of God he must find a way to retrieve her and escape banishment from Heaven.  Things don&#39;t go as well as he plans when he meets his match in battle.  He finds himself helpless, hopeless,  and in Hell.  Unwilling to accept defeat Aufero challenges Satan and discovers a side of the fallen angel he hadn&#39;t expected.  When Satan offers him paradise, he must make a tough decision that could find him in a no win situation.  Forced to fight to the death he must find the will and strength to defeat a demon that&#39;s never been bested.  Should he succeed in his action against the devil he is faced with another dilemma.  Will his success in Hell lead to his failure in Heaven?&lt;/p&gt;" />
