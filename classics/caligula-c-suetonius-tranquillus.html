Suetonius mentions that Caligula married his own sister, threatened to make his horse consul, and according to one rumor said he had his soldiers pick sea shells on their way to invade Britain (clearly the man was nuts). He would have people assassinated randomly, and then call for them. When they failed to appear he said they must have committed suicide. Eventually Caligula would be assassinated at a Gladiatorial event by a disgruntled guard, but not after earning a reputation as one of the maddest of Caesars ever to rule." />
