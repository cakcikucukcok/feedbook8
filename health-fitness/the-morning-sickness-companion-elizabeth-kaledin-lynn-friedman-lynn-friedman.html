  <title>The Morning Sickness Companion - Elizabeth Kaledin, Lynn Friedman, Lynn Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s frustrating and a nuisance--and it can be a major obstacle to experiencing the joy of pregnancy. But morning sickness doesn&#39;t always strike in the morning, and for many women it doesn&#39;t even strike--it&#39;s an ever-present part of their pregnancy, with symptoms ranging from mild nausea and exhaustion to crippling depression and physical illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know the standard suggestions--crackers and tea, Jell-O and ginger ale--but when they don&#39;t seem like enough, what can women really do to manage their symptoms and recover the happiness their pregnancy should bring? As debilitating as morning sickness is, we don&#39;t hear much about it. But finally, just when it seems as though there&#39;s nothing out there, women have somewhere to turn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Kaledin&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Morning Sickness Companion&lt;/i&gt; is a book by and for women suffering morning sickness. Morning sickness is a reality of pregnancy--many women are affected--and this book is dedicated to them. It fills a major void in pregnancy literature, providing a brief history of morning sickness, all the latest scientific thinking, research on its emotional toll, and lots of reassuring tips and advice from other women about what they ate, how sick they really were, sources of relief, and how to survive, since the fact is it is nearly inevitable. Engaging, warm, often funny, and always informative, &lt;i&gt;The Morning Sickness Companion&lt;/i&gt; offers women who are suffering the wisdom and comfort they really need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
