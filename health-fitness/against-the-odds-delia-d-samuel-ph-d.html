      <meta name="description" content="Being a parent is a hard job, especially when the children are young. Being a single parent makes the relationship more complex and time-consuming. Finally, coping with children with disabilities makes this even more demanding. Samuelauthor, professor of mathematics, trained singer, and single mother of two sons diagnosed with autismstates that raising them well is possible and can bring a lot of satisfaction.This memoir/self-help book is full of optimism and exclamation points....The parents role never ends, apparently, but with patience, individual attention, love, organization, and adjustments to expectations, daily life is manageable, even enjoyable.
-The US Review of Books
According to a U.S. census study, about 20% of U.S. residents cope with special needs. Parents and caregivers who are faced with this issue of special needs experience feelings of denial, confusion, guilt, anger and hopelessness. Caring for special needs individuals is not an easy task, but it is possible. It is a journey that brings out the best in any individual who has chosen to embrace that challenge. The author gives the details of her journey as a mother of two boys with multiple special needs and illustrates the strategies that she has used to deal with the daily struggles that life presents her as she mothers her two children. She explains how acceptance of this challenge has led to it being the greatest blessing of her life. Against the odds is an inspiring narrative that will provide guidance for parents and caregivers who are searching for new tools and insights into how to raise children with special needs and for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of this important subject." />
