  <title>Bouncer - Kipling Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Georgell is a no-nonsense bouncer at a popular nightclub. When a violent shooter opens fire on the innocent crowd outside his bar, Georgell is shocked to find himself among the victims hit on the nightclub front steps. Unlike others, however, he surviveswith the consequences. Although his physical wounds heal, scars remain on his psyche. No one can reach himnot even his loving wifeso Georgell attempts to lose himself in work.
In work, though, he finds no comfort. Georgell sees things. He swears dark shadows hang over unsuspecting patrons. These dark shadows appear dangerous; Georgell fears more people might get hurt. He also fears for his own sanity. It soon becomes apparent he isnt the only bouncer who can see the dark shadows. His coworker Moose sees them too, and its hard to ignore the sense of foreboding they share. 
Soon, they realize the most powerful dark being hovers over another bouncer at the establishment. Georgell and Moose have no idea why theyve been given the ability to see these creatures, but they know they must do something. This evil influence foreshadows darkness, and two mortal men must stand in the way of otherworldly demons or else say goodbye to life as they know it." />
