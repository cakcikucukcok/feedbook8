  <title>Turkish Delight - Gerald Caskey, Debbie Caskey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jim and Valerie Quinn are educators who have a burning desire to teach in an international situation. On a previous visit to Turkey, they fell in love with both the people and the place. The people are very warm-hearted and hospitable. The cuisine is exotic. The country is the cradle of Christianity and a mecca of archaeological ruins. The landscape is peppered with fishing villages and rich farmland, as well as luxury hotels and fine dining.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival in Izmir, Jim and Val are showered with the initial installments of Turkish delight. Warmly received at the Izmir Turkish/English Academy, the Quinns are pleasantly surprised at the assistance they receive house hunting and enrolling their children in school. Assuming their teaching responsibilities, Jim and Val show their strong suit of relationship-building with foreign students. They have embarked on one of the most adventurous and challenging experiences of their lives. The Quinns teaching credentials and experience suggest a rewarding career progression. An added bonus will come in their travel to ancient church sites and in exploration of excavated ruins. The equation adds up to what they will soon discover as pure Turkish delight!&lt;/p&gt;" />
