  <title>Buddhism in the Light of Christ: A Former Buddhist Nun&#39;s Reflections, with Some Helpful Suggestions on How to Reach Out to Your Buddhist Friends - Esther  Baker, Alex G. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Buddhism&#39;s influence is growing in the West, as seen in the widespread use of Buddhist mindfulness apps in people&#39;s attempts to unwind, or the casual use of words like nirvana and karma that have crept into the English language. Whether we meet it in the East or West, what is Buddhism? What is at the heart of its teachings? How does Buddhism differ from Christianity, and are they compatible? Through a collection of true short stories and testimonies, Buddhism in the Light of Christ--a sequel and companion to Esther Baker&#39;s first book, I Once was a Buddhist Nun--takes an insightful look at some core Buddhist beliefs and practices, and then reflects on them from a Christian viewpoint and biblical understanding.  Esther tackles important questions such as: How does the Buddhist goal nirvana and God differ? and Is Buddhism a form of idolatry? Her responses reveal a penetrating understanding that helps to unravel and demystify the true nature of Buddhism. Buddhism in the Light of Christ also includes helpful suggestions on how to share Jesus with Buddhist friends, as well as important considerations regarding discipleship once a Buddhist has come to know Christ." />
