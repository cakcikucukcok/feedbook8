  <title>A Peek At Her Dog Act - David Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A bestiality story of a woman who dares to let its most base desires and sexual passions came to the fore. She is one of a few who are willing to accept the consequences, reward or punishment, for allowing herself to become completely liberated. Her story of love with her dog is a startling insight into the lives of a woman whose motto might be: &amp;ldquo;If it feels good, do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Judy Sutton liked to jerk off dogs. Judy was 18-years-old, pert, nubile and popular. In most ways she was perfectly normal, and her sex life was energetic. She had three fairly steady boyfriends, all of whom she fucked regularly, and once in a while she would go to a single&amp;#39;s bar and get picked up by some well-hung stranger for a bit of variation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since Judy therefore had all the fucking that she needed, it wasn&amp;#39;t a case of frustration that led to her fixation with dog prick. She simply liked to pull a dog&amp;#39;s cock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dogs liked it, too..." />
