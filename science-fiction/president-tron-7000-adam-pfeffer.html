  <title>President Tron 7000 - Adam Pfeffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2056, androids have become commonplaceso much so that the United States has elected its first android president. President Tron 7000 might be just what the country needs. He knows all the answers and vows to include everyone in his programs for a new America. 
Not everyone is convinced, however. Aging reporter Hudge Stone believes that the election of an android must be a mistake. Even though the new president has pledged to end nuclear war and provide better education for all, it seems too good to be true. When President Tron is shot by an angry human being, however, all hell breaks loose. Tron declares humans enemies of the state and sets out to exterminate them, calling all other robots to join him. There is little doubt which side is stronger, and only time will tell what the future of the human race will bewhether humans will survive or be made extinct by the machines they have created.
In this science fiction novel exploring humanitys quest for perfection through technology, humans fight to survive against androids determined to destroy them." />
