  <title>The Auroral Entanglement - James Nabi Michael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jack, a bush pilot, charters tours of Alaskas terrain that includes night flights to view the aurora borealis from the sky. One fateful October night, when forecasters predict an exceptionally vivid aurora, Jack embarks on a solo flight to fly closer to the multicolored lights. Drawn to a fingerlike funnel that stretches toward the ground, Jack ignores the concerns in the back of his mind and flies through the anomaly before it dissipates back into the night sky. As Jack returns to the airport, he has no idea that his life is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few days later, Jack is sitting in a local bar with friends when he suddenly realizes something is different. For a moment Jack seems to come out of himself  he can feel the pain of others, and sees brief flashes cross his mind. It is not long before Jack discovers he has developed a strange ability to entangle his mind with others. With his newfound gift, Jack soon finds ways to aid friends, uncover falsehoods, and even intertwine his mind with an eagle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this intriguing science fiction tale, a fearless pilot must come to terms with his telepathic ability and somehow weave his unintended gift into the course of his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
