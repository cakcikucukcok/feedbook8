  <title>Cruising with Fred and His Unsinkable &quot;Molly Brown&quot; - Capt. Gardner Martin Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
            Fred has led a mediocre life for over sixty years. He wants some adventure in his life. He bought a boat to cruise around and down the waterway.
        &lt;p&gt;
        His wife will not join him. He has to get away or in his frustration he will do his first acting of violence.
        &lt;p&gt;
        He loves the boat and his freedom. He finds exciting sex with a pretty boat bum. Later he is mugged and thrown off a bridge by a salt and pepper team
        of robbers and loses his boat and memory.
        &lt;p&gt;
        He rescues a woman in dire distress and becomes judge and jury of her tormentor. The mugger team crosses his path and restores his memory. He kills the
        pair before they kill him and the woman.
        &lt;p&gt;
        Dope smugglers tradeoffs make Fred well to do. He finds a home for the mental injured woman. He decides to buy another boat and search for his lost
        craft. Another woman with a young son enters his life and boat. He searches all the way to Florida and gets involved with two crooked custom agents.
        Violence and death occurs.
        &lt;p&gt;
        He discovers his lost boat after a cruise up the waterway. Freds heart worried him as he cruises back to Fort Lauderdale for his woman there. He plans
        to take it real easy and share her with her young husband. The young wife wants another child. Fred enjoys his lifestyle and his new bigger yacht
        moored under the overhead roof up the New River. His sex life is complicated by the inclusion of the little boys grandmother. She brings the boy to
        visit Fred. She also announces that a new baby is on the way and she knows who the father is. She is not hoggish and will share. Long live Fred, long
        will he enjoy his two women.
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        The End
