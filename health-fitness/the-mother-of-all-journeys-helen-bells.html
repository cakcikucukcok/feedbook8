  <title>The Mother of All Journeys - Helen Bells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a personal story of a young woman&#39;s transition from independent newly-wed, through the anguish and depression of pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, to the realisation that life, as she knew it, would never be the same again - not for her or her husband.  
Having plunged into the depths of despair, almost from the moment of conception, she wondered how she could possibly return to the cheerful, carefree person she had once been.
The poignancy of this book centres particularly on the fact that the author felt like an outcast who had nothing in common with other pregnant mothers and new parents.  How could she feel so low when everywhere around her were books and &quot;experts&quot; telling her how wonderful motherhood was and how overjoyed she should be feeling?
With the support of family and friends and a long-suffering husband, two years on this young woman is a happy, caring mother of a beautiful son who is bonny, healthy and loved unconditionally.  And she is back to normal.
