  <title>Mr. Darcy&#39;s Diary - Amanda Grange</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday 9th September&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;I left London today and met Bingley at Netherfield Park. I had forgotten what good company he is; always ready to be pleased and always cheerful. After my difficult summer, it is good to be with him again. ...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only place Darcy could share his innermost feelings was in the private pages of his diary... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Torn between his sense of duty to his family name and his growing passion for Elizabeth Bennet, all he can do is struggle not to fall in love. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mr. Darcy&#39;s Diary&lt;/b&gt; presents the story of the unlikely courtship of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy from Darcy&#39;s point of view. This graceful imagining and sequel to Pride and Prejudice explains Darcy&#39;s moodiness and the difficulties of his reluctant relationship as he struggles to avoid falling in love with Miss Bennet. Though seemingly stiff and stubborn at times, Darcy&#39;s words prove him also to be quite devoted and endearing - qualities that eventually win over Miss Bennet&#39;s heart. This continuation of a classic romantic novel is charming and elegant, much like Darcy himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pride and Prejudice has inspired a large number of modern day sequels, the most successful of which focus on the rich, proud Mr. Darcy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;What readers and reviewers are saying about&lt;b&gt; Mr. Darcy&#39;s Diary&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;A delicious treat for all Austen addicts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Amanda Grange knows her subject...&lt;font color=&quot;#993366&quot;&gt;I ended up reading the entire book in one sitting&lt;/font&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brilliant, you could almost hear Darcy&#39;s voice...I was &lt;font color=&quot;#993366&quot;&gt;so sad when it came to an end&lt;/font&gt;.
