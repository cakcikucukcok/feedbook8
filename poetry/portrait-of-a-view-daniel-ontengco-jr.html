  <title>Portrait of a View - Daniel Ontengco Jr.</title>

I began the book in 1993,and finally completed it in 2004. The poems are not entirely autobiographical but do include a large amount of myself in them. There is reality that is masked and fiction that is realized. The reader can judge which is which. The majority of the poems are one page creations with a focus more on originality rather than structure. Although many of the poems do experiment with differing rhyme sequences and poem types, the emphasis is on creating something that is different and in my own style.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

However, after several years, I started to feel that I would like to publish the poems as one book. I wrote a few at a time when I was feeling inspired. I never wrote unless I had the creative itch, and had what I thought was a good enough idea. I hope that the reader will enjoy at least some of these ideas and not judge the rest too harshly. I was never trying to impress anyone but myself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

I hope that at least in some small way, I have accomplished this in my portrait of a view.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
