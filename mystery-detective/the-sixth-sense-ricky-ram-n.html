  <title>The Sixth Sense - Ricky Ram贸n</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joining the Chicago Police Department and being able to make a difference in his city and community has always been a dream of Richard&#39;s. Never once did he think he would have such a strong role at such a young age, and to top it off, he&#39;s recently discovered his new-found ability to have premonitions of the future; the only catch is that it happens at times that he&#39;s not expecting it. When his crew is called on a case to solve a bank robbery, where the robbers made off with north of two million, this proves to be difficult. Even with his newfound ability, Richard is still surprised at almost every turn of the case, and with so much on the line, he knows how vital it is to apprehend the suspects and won&#39;t rest until they&#39;re captured. It&#39;s a game of cat and mouse as many different tribulations cross the gang&#39;s path to catch the suspects, with many interesting twists." />
